caption: '(A) The TORC1-TORC2 network and key feedback mechanisms. The mTOR serine-threonine
  kinase forms two multi-protein complexes whose defining subunits are raptor (TORC1)
  and rictor (TORC2). TORC2 activity is stimulated by association with ribosomes and
  by growth factors through a poorly defined mechanism, which may involve PI3K. TORC2
  promotes stability and activity of AKT and other kinases including serum- and glucocorticoid-induced
  kinases (SGKs) and protein kinase C (PKC). TORC1 is a signal integrator whose activity
  is tuned by diverse inputs. Growth factors, energy sensors and cellular stress converge
  at the level of the TSC complex (TSC1/TSC2/TBC1D7), a negative regulator of TORC1
  with GAP activity towards the Rheb GTPase. Amino acids regulate TORC1 through the
  Ragulator and GATOR complexes. TORC1 promotes anabolic programs through many substrates,
  of which three classes are shown: S6 kinases, eukaryotic initiation factor-4E (eIF4E)-binding
  proteins (4E-BPs), and autophagy regulators (ULK1, etc.). TORC1 activity exerts
  feedback control on growth factor signaling. One canonical feedback pathway is initiated
  by S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), a TORC1 substrate, which phosphorylates adaptor proteins
  of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) family to attenuate growth factor receptor
  signaling to PI3K and RAS. In parallel, TORC1 suppresses growth factor receptor
  signaling by phosphorylating the GRB10 adaptor protein. AKT activity triggers a
  feedback mechanism that suppresses growth factor receptor expression and signaling.
  Through phosphorylation and inactivation of Forkhead Box Subgroup O (FOXO) transcription
  factors, active AKT reduces the transcription of FOXO target genes including several
  growth factor receptors. (B) Redundancy and feedback between the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK
  and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling networks. ERK and downstream kinase RSK can compensate
  for AKT in the activation of TORC1 via inhibitory TSC phosphorylation; GSK3 and
  AMPK phosphorylation of TSC2 increase its ability to suppress TORC1 activity. MNK
  kinases phosphorylate eIF4E to provide a distinct signal to increase cap-dependent
  translation. ERK and mTOR independently promote accumulation of MYC oncoproteins.
  Mutual feedback inhibition is a feature of the two pathways: MEK activity suppresses
  PI3K signaling by promoting PTEN membrane localization, while TORC1 activity suppresses
  RAS activation through mechanisms shown in .'
