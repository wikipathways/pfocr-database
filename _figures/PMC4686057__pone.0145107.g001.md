caption: This network represents Pearson correlations (R >0.8, p-value<0.005) computed
  considering expression values of genes of interest according to the microarray data
  and using Cytoscape tool. We selected those genes on the ECM-receptor interaction
  KEGG pathway and COL6A genes. Continuous lines represent positive correlations and
  discontinuous lines negative ones. Those correlations that are significant in patients´cells
  only are represented in black lines. Orange lines represent those correlations that
  are present in both patients and control cells but are of different sign (positive
  or negative) whereas those that have the same sign are represented by lilac lines.
  Red lines around gene symbols represent significantly over-expressed genes and green
  lines those that were under-expressed in patients´ fibroblasts relative to control
  fibroblasts.
