caption: Proposed mechanisms and functions of glycogen metabolic pathway in L. acidophilus
  . Based on proposed central functions of glycogen metabolism in other microorganisms
  [,,] and findings from this study, carbohydrate substrates imported by the cells
  may be either metabolized through the glycolytic pathway, or shunted to glycogen
  biosynthetic pathway when a carbon source is not immediately required for glycolysis.
  The carbon pool may serve as an energy storage reserve and as a carbon capacitor
  that senses and modulates downstream carbon flow to maintain efficient carbon utilization
  and energetic homeostasis of the cells. The roles of glycogen metabolism in central
  carbon metabolism influence various physiological functions and consequently the
  retention and probiotic attributes of L. acidophilus. Our fundamental understanding
  of this pathway will inspire strategies to improve the stability and functionalities
  of probiotic and beneficial commensal microorganisms in the host.
