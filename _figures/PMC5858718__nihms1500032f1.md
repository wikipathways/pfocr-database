caption: 'How radiation impacts tumor and immune cells to modulate the immunological
  response. Right side: Tumor cell (brown) interacts with T cell (blue circle) to
  suppress response, but radiation-induced cell death releases DAMPs and CRT/gp96,
  which activate macrophages (irregular blue cells) to produce IFN-γ and IL-12-stimulating
  CD8 cells, thereby increasing cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL, round blue cells). Radiation
  damage can also directly stimulate macrophage IFN-γ production as well as suppress
  Treg cells (green cells). Radiation damage to the tumor cell can also initiate DNA
  and new antigen release. Left side: Antigen processing pathway from immunoproteosome
  production of peptides to cell surface display for immune recognition.'
