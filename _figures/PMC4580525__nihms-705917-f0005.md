caption: 'Cross-regulation of GPCR and Nox signaling pathways can induce cell death
  by apoptosis. Cross-regulatory mechanisms contributing to cell death have been noted
  among different GPCR signal transduction pathways and between GPCR signaling and
  Nox activation. This simplified schematic illustrates an example of such complex
  interactions. Increased activity of a Gαq-coupled GPCR activates a PLC effector
  pathway, resulting in production of the second messengers DAG and IP3. DAG then
  stimulates PKC, whereas IP3 causes mobilization of Ca2+ from the ER lumen into the
  cytoplasm. This elevation of PLC signaling can also induce Nox activation through
  a direct action of Ca2+- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Rac1 and p47phox. The
  two major cytosolic subunits of Nox then generate ROS. Ca2+ mobilization induced
  by IP3 also activates AC, followed by opening of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane
  as well as SOCs. These regulatory mechanisms acting together could cause further
  elevation of Ca2+ in the cytosol. Whereas Ca2+ channel–mediated Ca2+ influx is facilitated
  by AC signaling, which could be a direct result of Gs activation and an indirect
  consequence of Gqsignaling, Gβγ could negatively regulate the action of this channel.
  Complex interactions of these signaling cascades alter the levels of the second
  messengers—Ca2+ and ROS—thereby playing an important role in promoting cell death.
