caption: Schematic representation of the regulatory mechanisms of SIRT1 on ER stress
  and NF-κB signaling pathways. (A) SIRT1 enhances the binding of GRP78 (BiP) to misfolded
  proteins, facilitating their recognition and dissociation from ER stress sensors
  (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6). SIRT1 also deacetylates eIF2α, IRE1, and XBP1s, modulating
  their activities in the UPR pathways. (B) SIRT1 deacetylates the NF-κB p65 subunit
  (RelA) directly and indirectly through p300, inhibiting NF-κB transcriptional activity.
  SIRT1 also activates AMPK, which inhibits IKK and NF-κB signaling. Additionally,
  SIRT1 upregulates the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, forming
  a negative feedback loop to suppress NF-κB activity
