caption: Assembly of the divisome. (A) Normal assembly pathway. The divisome assembles
  in two stages. In the first stage the Z ring forms when FtsZ filaments, attached
  to the membrane by ZipA and FtsA, coalesce into the ring. FtsEX acts on FtsA to
  convert it to a monomer (m) which recruits the late division proteins. ZipA also
  assists in this step. The last protein in the pathway FtsN activates septal PG synthesis
  with NFtsN interacting with FtsA in the cytoplasm and EFtsN acting in the periplasm.
  The blue arrows indicate known or suspected interactions and the red arrows indicate
  regulatory interactions. (B) Alternative assembly pathway. Some proteins can be
  bypassed by mutation or environmental conditions. ftsA* mutations, which make FtsA
  more monomeric, can bypass FtsEX, ZipA or FtsK individually. Under these conditions
  FtsN, normally the last protein recruited, is postulated to back recruit the other
  proteins. Overexpression of FtsN or activating mutations in ftsL and ftsB can also
  bypass FtsEX, ZipA or FtsK. It is likely that these conditions also favor the interaction
  between FtsA and FtsN.
