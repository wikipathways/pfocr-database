caption: 'Summary of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle with the possible therapeutic approaches.
  Steps of the life cycle: 1. the RBD of the viral spike bind to the ACE-2 with the
  intervention of TMPRSS2; 2. entry of the SARS-CoV-2 via endocytosis autophagy pathway
  where autolysosome integrate viral contents and cut it down; 3. Viral (+)ssRNA is
  encoded and released in the cytosol; 4. ORF1a and ORF1ab are the first genes encoded,
  expressing 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) implicated in the transcription and
  translation processes. Among the NSPs, RdRp (RNA polymerase) copies the viral RNA.
  Genes of the ORFs 2, 4, 5, and 9 encode the spike, envelope, membrane successively,
  and nucleocapsid the structural proteins; 5. Assembling of the viral proteins and
  RNA in the host''s endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus; 6. The assembled virions
  travel in vesicles to the cell membrane and are released by exocytosis. The possible
  therapeutic approaches: A. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and scavenging through convalescent
  therapy and soluble ACE-2; B. Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory approaches
  using pharmacophores that impede the over-reaction of inflammatory response and
  cytokines storm; C. blockage of the viral fusion during penetration process; D.
  Inhibition of reverse transcription; E. The use of Protease inhibitors.'
