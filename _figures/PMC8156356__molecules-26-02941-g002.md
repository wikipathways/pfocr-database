caption: 'Sweet cherries effects in modulating the intracellular signaling that governs
  cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. Regardless of anthocyanins or proanthocyanins
  enrichment, sweet cherry extracts reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis
  with altered expression and/or activity of several molecular targets. However, extracts
  enriched in anthocyanins or proanthocyanins can influence specific molecular targets
  (see text for details). Overall, mechanistically, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K) pathway was inhibited with the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and
  AKT as targets. Cytokine receptors signaling could also be influenced by sweet cherry
  extract, namely by the modulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) 3 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB
  or RelA/p50). In the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, altered activity
  of p38-MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) was reported. Concerning apoptosis, the sweet cherry extract enriched
  in anthocyanins influenced both the extrinsic (caspase-8) and intrinsic (B-cell
  lymphoma 2-associated X protein (Bax), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), cytochrome
  c release, caspase-9) pathways, culminating in the activation of caspase-3. Whole
  sweet cherry extract or extract enriched in proanthocyanins activated only the intrinsic
  pathway (Bax, AIF, caspase-9 and -3, and cytochrome c release). Green and red arrows
  mean up- and down-regulation of expression and/or activity, respectively. Legend:

  kinase; TFs, Transcription factors.'
