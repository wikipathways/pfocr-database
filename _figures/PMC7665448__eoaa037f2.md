caption: (A) SARS-CoV-2 infects the host through angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
  2 receptors which are elevated in inflammatory conditions. Infection triggers the
  TH1 response, which produces proinflammatory cytokines. When overproduced, TH1 cytokines
  trigger the hyperinflammatory TH17 response [, ]. These responses inhibit Treg cell
  differentiation, which is needed to suppress inflammatory cytokines. A cytokine
  storm occurs when proinflammatory cytokines proliferate uncontrollably. (B) The
  TH2 response to STHs suppresses inflammation through the production of anti-inflammatory
  and regulatory cytokines, as well as by balancing the TH1 pathway through the production
  of CD4+ T cells and Treg cells [, , ]. The TH17 response is less likely to be induced
  and the cytokine storm should not occur []. STHs are associated with reduction in
  inflammatory comorbidities [, ], further reducing likelihood of a cytokine storm
  and ACE2 receptor presence []. The TH2 response may also directly reduce ACE2 receptor
  presence [, ]
