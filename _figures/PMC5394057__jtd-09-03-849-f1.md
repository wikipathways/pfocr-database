caption: 'Cellular mechanisms of radioresistance: (I) the cell cycle checkpoint signaling
  pathway is a critical progress that allowing times for cells to response to repair
  DNA damage. Cell cycle often arrests in G1/S or G2/M period. The primary mechanism
  of reparation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ);
  (II) the surface biomarkers of cancer stem cells (CSCs) consist of CD44, CD71, CD90,
  CD133, CD271, ALDH, and ABCG2; (III) the balance of autophagy and apoptosis is another
  mechanism of radioresistance. Autophagy, as a conserved process that mediate the
  degradation, dysfunctional organelles and turnover of long-lived proteins, can limit
  the effect of radiotherapy through supporting metabolic mechanism in cellular stress
  times; (IV) epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is common in cancer progression
  and related to radioresistance.'
