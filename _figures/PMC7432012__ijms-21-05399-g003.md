caption: 'Tumor necrosis factor beta (TNFα), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), bone morphogenetic
  protein (BMP), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) are stiffness-dependent
  signaling pathways. Binding of TNFα to its receptor leads to activation of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. MAP3K and MAP2K are activated and three groups of
  MAP kinases are involved: ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase. Activation of p38 further
  activates transcription factor activation transcription factor 2 (ATF2), which enhances
  transcription of osteogenic genes such as RUNX2, liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatase
  (ALPL) and hypertrophic collagen Col10A1. Phosphorylation of ERK and JNK leads to
  activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and also the activation
  of RUNX2, ALPL, Col10A1, and additionally matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13).
  The binding of IL-1β activates interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) and
  leads to similar downstream effectors in chondrocytes (CHs). BMP signaling occurs
  via the SMA- and MAD-related protein (SMAD)-dependent pathway. Signaling is initiated
  by binding to type I or type II serine/threonine kinase receptors and forming a
  heterotetrameric complex. The type I receptor is transphosphorylated by constitutively
  active type II receptor and activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), which activates
  R-SMAD1/5/8. Phosphorylated R-SMAD1/5/8 then binds to its co-receptor SMAD4 and
  translocates into the nucleus, where it initiates transcription of BMP-specific
  genes (e.g., RUNX2). TGF-β is initiated by ligand binding to receptor types I and
  II with ALK5. SMAD2/3 gets activated and also binds to co-activator SMAD4. The translocation
  into the nucleus activates transcription of chondrogenic genes like collagen type
  II and aggrecan (ACAN). Ligand binding also activates mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7, also known as TAK1) and TGF-β activated kinase 1
  (MAP3K7) binding protein 1 (TAB1), leading to further activation of MKK3 and phosphorylation
  of p38. Phosphorylated p38 leads to transcription of RUNX2 and MMP-13.'
