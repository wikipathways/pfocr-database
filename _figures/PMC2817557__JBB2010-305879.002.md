caption: A schematic illustration of the recognition of microbial associated molecular
  patterns (MAMPs), such as LPS (lipopolysaccharide), by pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs) on epithelial cells and activation of three (A, B, and C) pathways that induce
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or chemokines. A. Expressed on the cell
  membrane of most intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  are triggered by LPS.  Four toll-like interleukin receptor (TIR) adaptors become
  involved in propagating TLR signaling, including Myd88 (myeloid differentiation
  primary-response gene 88), TIRAP (toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain containing
  adapter protein), TRAM (translocating chain-associated membrane protein), and the
  TRAF (TNF receptor associated factor) protein family. This interaction induces phosphorylation
  and activation of TAK1, leading to activation of IKKs.  Inactive IKK sequesters
  NFκB in the cytoplasm and leads to degradation of IκB, with subsequent release of
  NFκB that induces transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. B.  In
  various cells, Myd88-dependent signaling is associated with activations of TAK1,
  also known as MAP kinases.  Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) is an intermediary
  of the MAPK pathway. Activated MEK subsequently phosphorylates ERK which translocates
  to the nucleus where it activates multiple transcription factors.  Cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-like (NOD) receptors also recognize MAMP. The ligand NOD1
  recognizes a peptidoglycan, a constituent only of gram-negative bacteria.  NOD2
  recognizes constituents of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  NODs
  transduce signals in the pathway of NFκB and MAP kinases.
