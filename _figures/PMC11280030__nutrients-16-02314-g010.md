caption: The mechanism of function of C. minuta and phenylalanine on AILD. Administration
  of phenylalanine leads to disruption of gut microbiota, making the liver more susceptible
  to drug damage, increasing inflammation and oxidative stress levels. C. minuta regulates
  phenylalanine metabolism, restores gut microbiota diversity, regulates MAPK pathway,
  reduces inflammation and oxidative stress levels, and alleviates liver damage finally
