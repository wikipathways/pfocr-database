caption: 'Metastasis from other organs to lungs via exosomes. PMN: pre-metastatic
  niche. Breast (A), bone (B), and colorectal (C) mediate exosome transfer to the
  lungs. (A) miRNA-138-5p decreases the expression level of KDM6B affecting macrophage
  polarization. Cav-1 inhibition of the PTEN/CCL2/VEGF-A signaling pathway affects
  macrophage polarization and PMN formation. Let-7s drive the transformation of N2
  neutrophils through Lin28B Wnt7a has an impact on PMN formation by activating PI3K/Akt/mTOR,
  leading to changes in the cytokine milieu of the lung prior to metastasis. Release
  of miRNA-223-3p by breast cancer cells via macrophage exosomes affects breast cancer
  lung metastasis by inhibiting Cbx5. (B) PD-L1 is released into the bloodstream as
  exosomes to induce macrophage polarization. Exosome-mediated Tim3 induces macrophage
  polarization. Rab22a-NeoF1 binds to PYK2, while PYK2 activates the RhoA signaling
  pathway to promote macrophage polarization. COL6A1 activates fibroblasts. They promotes
  bone cancer lung metastasis by secreting cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β
  and VEGF. (C) miRNA-10a inhibits human lung fibroblasts and reduces the expression
  of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, affecting PMN production. miRNA-25-3p reduces the expression
  of VEGFR2, ZO-1, occludin and Claudin5 through KLF2 and KLF4, and affects PMN generation.
  CXCL12 and CXCR7 are important components of PMN. miRNA-4299 increases expression
  levels through HIF-1α and promotes colorectal cancer lung metastasis through ZBTB4'
