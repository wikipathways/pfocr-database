caption: 'Upon viral infection, RIG-I and MDA5 recognize cytoplasmic viral RNA species:
  short dsRNA containing a 5′ tri- or di-phosphate moiety by RIG-I and long dsRNA
  structures by MDA5. The RNA ligands recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 during DENV and
  WNV infection remain unknown. Upon RNA binding, RIG-I and MDA5 multimerize and translocate
  from the cytoplasm to the outer membrane of mitochondria to bind to the adaptor
  protein MAVS. For RIG-I multimerization and translocation, K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of RIG-I induced by the E3 ligase TRIM25 and binding to the mitochondrial-targeting
  chaperone protein 14-3-3ε are critical. The cGAS-STING pathway also restricts DENV
  and WNV infection. Upon binding to dsDNA–viral DNA in the case of DNA virus infection,
  or likely host-derived DNA (e.g., mitochondrial DNA) associated with DENV or WNV
  infection–cGAS produces the second messenger cGAMP (cyclic GMP-AMP), which binds
  to and activates STING, a critical adaptor protein localized at the ER.Following
  their activation, MAVS and STING multimerize and assemble a large ‘signalosome’
  complex, comprised of RIP1, TRAF family members, and other signaling proteins (not
  illustrated), ultimately inducing the activation of TBK1, IKKε, and the IKKα/β/γ
  complex. TBK1/IKKε phosphorylate the transcription factors IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7,
  whereas the IKKα/β/γ complex activates NF-κB. IRF3/5/7 and NF-κB together with AP1
  (not illustrated) induce the transcriptional activation of type I and III IFNs,
  and other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to establish an antiviral state.DENV
  and WNV inhibit the RIG-I-MAVS and cGAS-STING signaling pathways through several
  mechanisms. The NS3 protein of DENV and WNV competes with RIG-I for 14-3-3ε binding,
  thereby preventing RIG-I translocation from the cytosol to mitochondrion-localized
  MAVS. NS3 encodes a phosphomimetic motif that resembles a conventional phosphorylation
  motif found in cellular 14-3-3-binding partners to interact with 14-3-3ε. Furthermore,
  the sfRNA of an epidemic DENV strain binds to TRIM25, blocking its deubiquitination
  and stabilization by USP15 (not illustrated). To dampen cGAS-STING signaling, the
  DENV NS2B/3 protease cleaves STING. Furthermore, WNV and DENV block common signaling
  molecules downstream of innate sensors. The WNV E protein inhibits activation of
  RIP1, whereas DENV NS2B/3 interferes with IKKε activity. The NS2A, NS4A, and NS4B
  proteins of DENV, and the NS4B protein of WNV, block the autophosphorylation-dependent
  activation of TBK1. Finally, DENV and WNV use the 2′-O-methyltransferase (MTase)
  activity of their NS5 proteins to generate type 1 cap structures in their mRNAs,
  thereby preventing translational inhibition by IFIT family proteins. Solid arrows
  indicate direct effects or well-established signaling events. Dashed arrows indicate
  signaling events that are either indirect or that have not yet been completely established.
