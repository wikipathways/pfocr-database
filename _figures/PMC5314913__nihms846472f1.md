caption: Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is regulated by metabolic cues, primarily
  glucose and amino acids, as well as by growth factors, hormones and cytokines. Glucose
  and amino acids enter cells via surface receptors such as glucose transporter type
  1, erythrocyte/brain (GLUT1) or glucose transporter type 4, insulin-responsive (GLUT4)
  and CD98, respectively. Growth factors stimulate tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs),
  which are activated through phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. In turn, TKR signals
  are transmitted to mTOR through phosphati-dylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase-1 (PDK1) and RAC serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT). Signalling through
  sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) also activates mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
  via PI3K. Downstream, AKT phosphorylates mTOR, which forms two interacting complexes,
  mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is composed of mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of
  TOR (raptor), TORC subunit LST8 (LST8), DEP-domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein
  (deptor) and proline-rich AKT1 substrate 1 (AKT1S1). mTORC2 is comprised of mTOR,
  rapa-mycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (rictor), stress-activated protein kinase
  interacting protein 1 (mSIN1, also known as TORC2 subunit MAPKAP1), protein observed
  with rictor-1 (protor-1), deptor and LST8. mTORC1 integrates growth signals reflecting
  the availability of nutrients and energy to promote either proliferation when conditions
  are favourable or autophagy when conditions are unfavorable; mTORC2 promotes cellular
  survival by activating AKT. Pharmacologically targetable checkpoints are highlighted
  in yellow. 4E–BP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1;
  AMBRA1, activating molecule in BECN1-regulated autophagy protein 1; AMPK, 5’-AMP-activated
  protein kinase; Arf1, ADP-ribosylation factor 1; FKBP12, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
  isomerase FKBP12; HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; PKCα,
  protein kinase C α type; PTEN, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase
  and dual-specificity protein phosphatase PTEN; RAPA, rapamycin; Rag-A/B, Ras-related
  GTP-binding protein A/B; ROI, reactive oxygen intermediate; S6K, ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase; SREBP1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1; STAT3, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3.
