caption: 'Probable KVP40 nucleotide metabolism pathway. KVP40 lacks genes for several
  enzymes for host DNA breakdown and synthesis of modified cytosine (glucosylated
  hydroxymethyl [Hm]-deoxycytosine), which are marked by X. The anaerobic ribonucleotide
  reductase (Nrd) likely acts on ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP), like the T4
  enzyme. KVP40 encodes a host-like dUTPase (CDS021) rather than the bifunctional
  T4-like dCTPase/dUTPase. Other abbreviations: Cd, dCMP deaminase; Endo, endonuclease;
  dNMP, deoxynucleoside monophosphate; dNDP, deoxynucleoside diphosphate; Td, thymidylate
  synthase; Tk, thymidine kinase. All other nomenclature is as for T4. CDS assignments
  are listed in Table .'
