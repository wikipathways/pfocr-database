caption: '(A) Removal of PCP pathway components perturbs ciliogenesis and in most
  the cases it happens through interference with basal body docking and vesicular
  transport that is necessary during cilliary assembly. Side view of the cell (left)
  shows how PCP effector Inturned interacts with DVL in Rho-mediated actin assembly
  in apical positioning of basal body. At the same time in the top-down view (right),
  Celsr2/3, CK1, DVL and PCP effector Fuzzy influence vesicular transport towards
  basal body via interactions with Rab GTPases. PCP effector protein Wdpcp, located
  at the transition zone, influences ciliogenesis by contributing to cargo sorting
  and restricting diffusion into ciliary compartment.(B) Formation of nodal cilia
  is initiated by Wnt8 ligand binding to Fzd8 receptor, which in turn leads to upregulation
  of Foxj1, a transcriptional regulator of ciliogenesis. Over time, cilia are positioned
  towards posterior of the cell by action of cascade involving Wnt11a, DVL, and Pitx2.
  Only correctly formed and positioned nodal cilia can create leftward fluid flow
  that determines left-right assymetry.(C) Multiciliated cells in epithelia display
  cell-autonomous type of polarity that makes sure that all cilia are oriented in
  the same fashion. This event is influenced by stability of DVL, controlled by its
  interactors: Inversin, APC/C and Rpgrip1l. On the other hand, tissue-wide posterior
  positioning is largely controlled by PCP pathway dependently on Vangl2 and Fzd3
  with help of ciliary proteins, such as Meckelin.'
