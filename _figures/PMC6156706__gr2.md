caption: 'Schematic of the mechanisms of action of metformin (Adapted from He and
  Wondisford, 2015). The working mechanisms of metformin have been shown to vary depending
  on the concentration of the drug. There are currently three different models of
  metformin actions. Mode 1 (Left): At supratherapeutic concentration, metformin inhibits
  complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). Thus, AMP concentration
  increases and inhibits the cAMP/PKA pathway, supressing gluconeogenesis. The elevated
  AMP:ATP ratio also leads to activation of the AMPK pathway by allosteric activation
  of the AMPK protein. Activated AMPK inhibits the actions of mTORC1 complex actions
  and therefore, downregulates pathways involving protein, synthesis, cell survival,
  cell growth and, proliferation. Mode 2 (Middle): This is the classical model of
  metformin''s working mechanism. At therapeutic concentration, metformin acts via
  the cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase LKB1, which phosphorylates the protein AMPK
  and directly activates the AMPK pathway. Activation of the AMPK pathway results
  in upregulation of the autophagy pathways and inhibition of glucose production via
  phosphorylation of the proteins CBP and CRTC2. Mode 3 (Right): At therapeutic concentration,
  metformin inhibits the transmembrane protein vATPase on the surface of the lysosome
  and increases the AMP/ATP ratio, and activates AMPK via allosteric activation as
  mentioned above. Simultaneously, metformin also promotes formation of the AXIN-LKB1-vATPase
  on the lysosomal surface and allosterically activates AMPK proteins attached to
  the lysosome surface. Formation of the vATPase-AXIN complex also leads to inhibition
  of the mTORC1 complex anchored on the lysosomal surface, which also leads to the
  decrease of cell survival, cell growth and proliferation.'
