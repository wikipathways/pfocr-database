caption: The PAH sensing and signaling pathway in CycloclasticusPahS is the receptor
  sensor of PAHs in the outer membrane. When PAHs are absent in the environment, PahS
  forms a two-component complex with PahP with high affinity. They constitute a cell
  surface sensory system (CSS) with a specialized two-component system (TCS). In the
  presence of PAHs, the system is activated by PAH binding to PahS. The signaling
  PAH molecule is transported through PahS to PahP, which then detaches from PahS,
  transverses the periplasm and binds tightly to PahK that is embedded in the inner
  membrane and triggers further signal transduction into the cytoplasm via PahR. PahR
  modulates multiple processes, including chemotaxis, PAH uptake, second-message-signaling
  pathways, etc.
