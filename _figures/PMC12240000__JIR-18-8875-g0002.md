caption: The Role of NLRP3 Inflammasome via Oxidative Stress in SIMD. Sepsis-induced
  oxidative stress promotes the generation of ROS through mitochondrial oxidation.
  The activation of P2X7 receptors by PAMPs and DAMPs triggers the influx of Ca2+
  and the efflux of K+. The resulting calcium overload and ROS disrupt mitochondrial
  integrity, leading to the release of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. This process
  facilitates the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasomes and induces apoptosis. Additionally,
  LPS activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, which promotes the expression of pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18. Subsequently, activated caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  into their active forms
