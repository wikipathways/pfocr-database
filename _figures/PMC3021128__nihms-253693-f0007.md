caption: '(A) Prior to replication we propose that SP sites in Mcm4 and Mcm6 are phosphorylated
  either by G1-CDKs or Pho85. It is also possible that this phosphorylation occurs
  earlier (e.g. by S-CDKs) and is not readily removed during G1. Upon entry into S
  phase we envision two possible mechanisms of DDK targeting: (i) DDK targets S-SPi-P
  and S-D/E sites to trigger helicase/origin activation; or (ii) Mec1 targets S-S-Q
  sites followed by DDK targeting of S-SPi-P, S-SPi-Q and S-D/E sites to trigger initiation.
  Based on our cell cycle studies, we propose that Mec1 is activated initially as
  a consequence of initiation events mediated by type (i) DDK targeting. Additional
  activation of Mec1 could be mediated by replication intermediates derived from type
  (ii) DDK driven initiation or checkpoint signaling.(B) Mec1 coordinates multiple
  events in both unperturbed and perturbed cell cycles. In a normal S phase, Mec1
  activates both dNTP synthesis and DDK targeting to Mcm2-7. Under conditions of DNA
  damage or stalled replication forks, Mec1 activates a checkpoint pathway that stabilizes
  stalled forks and inhibits further origin firing. We propose that Mec1 activation
  could also facilitate firing of additional origins upon checkpoint recovery.'
