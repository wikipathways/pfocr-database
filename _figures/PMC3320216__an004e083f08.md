caption: In the compartmentalized model, the CiMASH mechanism is working in the postsynaptic
  compartment in which NMDA-receptor-mediated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) directly signals to a subset of postsynaptic mitochondria (type B)
  that increase their tricarboxylic acid cycle activity driven by breakdown of glucose-derived
  pyruvate (pyr). Notice that glucose-derived pyruvate is only in partial equilibrium
  with lactate (Lac)-generated pyruvate. When the CiMASH mechanism is activated, glucose-derived
  lactate is produced and released to the extracellular space for oxidation at a later
  time point. Pyruvate derived from extracellular lactate is metabolized in a mitochondrial
  compartment that is not affected by postsynaptic Ca2+signalling (type A). At the
  presynaptic compartment, the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC)-activated ER-to-mitochondria
  Ca2+-signalling will affect mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism (type
  C) of glucose-derived pyruvate and activate the CiMASH mechanism to some extent;
  the lactate generated in this compartment is not able to leave the cell due to lack
  of transporters. It should be noted that substrate-level phosphorylation in the
  glycolytic pathway probably plays a functionally important role at the presynaptic
  terminal (not shown here).
