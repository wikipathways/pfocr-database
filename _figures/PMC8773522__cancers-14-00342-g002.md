caption: Effects of exercise in muscle and possible mechanisms for treating cachexia.
  Increase of myokine IL-6 can induce an anti-inflammatory effect, increasing IL-10
  and IL-1ra and reducing TNF-alpha. A greater production of antioxidants than pro-oxidants
  can be responsible for restoring redox homeostasis during exercise. Increased activity
  of the PI3K/ALT/mTOR pathway and reduced activity of the ubiquitin–proteasome and
  autophagy–lysosomal pathways can induce protein homeostasis, increasing muscle synthesis
  and decreasing muscle degradation. The activation of PGC-1alpha can regulate genes
  involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and redox homeostasis (nuclear respiratory
  factors 1 and 2 and mitochondrial transcription factor A), increase the expression
  of GLUT-4, regulate glucose metabolism, and reduce FoxO function and proteolysis.
