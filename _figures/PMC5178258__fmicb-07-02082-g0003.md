caption: Graphical representation of potential metabolic activities of acidophilic
  Sideroxydans strains. The figure represents the pool of metabolic pathways that
  were reconstructed from the metagenomic sequence data of contigs assigned to strains
  of the genus Sideroxydans. It therefore does not express the co-occurrence of various
  pathways within the same strain. Biochemical reactions do not reflect real stoichiometry
  with the exception of cases were it was judged to be of relevance. Question marks
  indicate that it is unknown which sulfur compound is oxidized via the Sox enzyme
  system. Based on its pKa (3.86) lactate is depicted in its acid form outside the
  cell, though the narrow difference to the external pH (3.5) means that only a small
  fraction of molecules will be protonated. Please also note in this context that,
  no lactate was added to the culture medium. Dotted arrows indicate that no details
  are provided on the multiple enzymes involved in the pathway while dashed lines
  indicate the potential path of a volatile compound (i.e., H2). For reasons of clarity
  no details are provided on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Arrows deviating
  from the the TCA cycle indicate its relevance as a central carbon metabolic pathway,
  though this line of metabolic function was not further investigated in this study.
  Carbon dioxide appears to be reduced to 3-phosphoglycerate via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham
  cycle indicated by its key enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
  (RuBisCO). Names for the nitrate transporter and nitrate and nitrite reductases
  are not indicated due to contradicting nomenclature in the databases. FHL, formate
  hydrogenlyase; AC III, alternative complex III; ETF, electron transfer flavoprotein
  oxidoreductase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; SQR, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase;
  CA, carbonic anhydrase; NADH dh, NADH dehydrogenase; Phn, phosphonate uptake system.
  Enzymes involved in metabolic pathways are abbreviated by their acronyms. For details
  see Supplementary Table .
