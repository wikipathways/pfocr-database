caption: (A) Schematic illustration of rewiring the metabolic pathway for improving
  supply of E4P. Cyan arrows represent the overexpressed genes. The abbreviations
  of metabolites and gene details were shown in Fig. . (B) Overview of genetic modifications
  of Module 3. Module 3 consists of Shikimate pathway and l‐tyrosine branch (the dashed boxes).
  Orange arrows indicate that the actions were tested. See Fig.  legend regarding
  abbreviations of these metabolites. (C) Tyrosol production after engineering of
  module 2 and module 3. The fermentations were performed at 30 °C in 50 ml YPD medium
  in shake flasks. Titre of tyrosol was detected after 72 h fermentation. Error bars
  represent the standard deviation of three biological duplicates.
