caption: Warburg effect advantage for cancer cells—biomass and NADPH production. The
  main metabolic pathways contributing to biomass production in a cancer cell as nucleotide
  synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, serine synthesis, glutaminolysis, cholesterol
  synthesis, and fatty-acid synthesis are presented. In addition, the inhibitors of
  enzymes/proteins involved in the Warburg effect together with their targets are
  presented on the graph. ADP adenosine diphosphate, ATP adenosine triphosphate, GAPDH
