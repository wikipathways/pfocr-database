caption: Conceptual model of the consequential pathways resulting from BMEC dysfunction
  in schizophrenia. (1) A disrupted paracellular structure allows blood materials
  including harmful substances to infiltrate into the brain parenchyma. (2) In the
  parenchyma, these blood materials activate astrocyte and/or microglia, causing them
  to release proinflammatory cytokines. (3) Astrocytic cytokines either activate microglia
  to release additional inflammatory cytokines or activate BMEC to release other proinflammatory
  cytokines, cytokine receptors, or adhesion molecules such as ICAM1. (4) Microglial
  cytokines stimulate the continued astrocytic release of proinflammatory cytokines
  that follow the positive feedback loop pathway described in (3). (5) Microglial
  cytokines also activate BMEC to release proinflammatory cytokines and other immune
  response molecules as described in (3). (6) Cytokines released by BMEC recruit other
  immune cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and T cells. (7) Cytokines
  and adhesion molecules such as ICAM1 help immune cells to extravasate into the parenchyma.
  (8) Immune cells stimulate continued microglial and astrocytic activation and the
  subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines, worsening BBB integrity.
