caption: Overview of the Notch Signaling Pathway and Its Role in Immune Cell Differentiation
  and Function. Upon binding of the Delta-like ligand (DLL) from an adjacent cell,
  the Notch receptor undergoes sequential cleavages first by ADAM10 and subsequently
  by γ-secretase, resulting in the release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD).
  NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it engages transcriptional regulators such
  as CSL and MAML, initiating the transcription of target genes. Within hematopoiesis,
  Notch signaling is essential for directing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) toward
  specific immune lineages, influencing the differentiation and maturation of T cells,
  B cells, and myeloid cells (including monocytes, dendritic cells, and granulocytes).
  Through its role in guiding immune cell fate and function, Notch signaling is vital
  for maintaining immune homeostasis and supporting effective immune responses
