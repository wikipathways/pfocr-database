caption: Cross-talk between the Wnt/β-catenin and RAS-ERK pathway. a In the absence
  of Wnt ligands, β-catenin is subjected to proteasomal degradation by association
  of the β-catenin destruction complex (yellow shaded) as described in Fig. . The
  active GSK3β in the destruction complex can also phosphorylate RAS. The β-TrCP E3
  ligase is recruited to both of the phosphorylated β-catenin and RAS proteins and
  subsequently degrades them via the polyubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation.
  Low β-catenin and RAS protein levels in cytoplasm ensure the repression of the signaling
  activities and target gene expressions. b In the presence of Wnt ligands, the dissociation
  of the destruction complex stabilizes both β-catenin and RAS in the cytoplasm, leading
  to the activation of the signaling pathways and target gene expressions
