caption: 'Multiple roles of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in modulating the cancer-immunity
  cycle. The cancer-immunity cycle progresses through tumor cell death and release
  of tumor antigens, tumor antigen presentation, priming and activation of T cells,
  trafficking of T cells, T-cell infiltration of tumor and recognition of tumor cells
  by effectors. Matrix remodeling shapes the inflamed immune microenvironment and
  plays a vital role at each step of the cancer-immunity cycle. Tumor antigen presentation
  and generation of the adaptive immune response depends on tumor-infiltrating Batf3-cDCs,
  matrikines, cytokines and chemokines of CCL and CXCL family. Versikine promotes
  differentiation of the potent immune-stimulator Batf3-cDCs. STING pathway activation,
  elicited by tumor cell-derived DNA, results in type I interferon (IFN) production
  and DC maturation. Endothelial cells, adhesion molecules and chemokines modulate
  trafficking of leukocytes. Stromal cells, including endothelial cells, pericytes
  and CAFs, and extracellular matrix components including collagens, GPs, GAGs and
  PGs, regulate infiltration and polarization of immune cells. Matrikines, cytokines
  and laminins regulate priming and activation of T cells. Matrix proteases and matrikines,
  including versikine, exert direct effects on immune cell polarization and activation.
  ICIs block immune checkpoints to induce anti-tumor immunity; however, the tumor
  matrix regulates generation and proliferation of the sustained host immune response.
  Matrix-derived immune biomarkers promise an innovative approach to predict response
  to novel immunotherapies. Abbreviations: Batf3-cDCs; Batf3-dependent classical dendritic
  cells, IRF8; interferon regulatory factor 8, IFN; interferon, STING; stimulator
