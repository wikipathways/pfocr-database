  4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; 2’OMT, 2’-O-methyltransferase; I2’H, isoflavone-2’-hydroxylase;
  ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; C4H, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; DMID, 7,2’-dihydroxy-4’-O-methoxyisoflavanol dehydratase
  (syn. pterocarpan synthase); CHS, chalcone synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase;
  F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3’H, flavanone 3’-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase;
  HID, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase; HI4’OMT, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone 4’-O-methyltransferase;
  IFR, isoflavone reductase; IFS, 2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; PKR, polyketide reductase (syn. chalcone
  reductase); PTR, pterocarpan reductase; VR, vestitone reductase. Purple color: enzymes
  of general phenylpropanoid pathway; grey color: enzymes of flavonoid pathway; blue
  color: enzymes of isoflavonoid pathway. Dashed arrows represent multiple biosynthetic
  steps. Trivial names of compounds are presented if they are commonly used; the others
  are presented by their semi-systematic names. Semi-systematic names and chemical
  structures of the referred flavonoids and isoflavonoids are attached online in .
  The names underlined in bold highlight most abundant isoflavonoids found in L. japonicus
  according to our data [].'
