caption: DNA replication catalyzed by an error-prone DNA polymerase might lead to
  occasional misinsertion of rNMPs along with erroneous bases (1). Type 2 RNase H
  recognizes a nucleotide with an extra 2'-OH group (2) and cleaves the phosphodiester
  bond at the RNA-DNA junction 5' to the rNMP (3). A DNA polymerase initiates strand-displacement
  DNA synthesis at the nick and the displaced single rNMP, or 5'-RNA-terminated DNA
  fragment is excised by the 5' nuclease activity either intrinsic to the polymerase
  or associated with a separate protein (4). When a DNA fragment in the vicinity of
  rNMP contains mispaired bases, its replacement by RER reduces the mutagenic consequences
  of DNA synthesis by an error-prone DNA polymerase. The DNA template left after completion
  of excision and re-synthesis steps contains a nick with 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate
  ends that is readily sealed by DNA ligase, thus completing the RER pathway (5).
  Mispaired bases outside the re-synthesis patch of RER can be replaced by the MMR.
  It has been proposed that in eukaryotes, a transient nick created during RER can
  serve as a signal that directs MMR to the mispaired base on the nascent strand.
