caption: TGF-β signaling. TGF-β signaling is a major paradigm underlying all manifestations
  of tissue fibrosis. Under canonical signaling TGF-β ligands are liberated from the
  extracellular microenvironment, upon which TGF-β binds to its membrane-bound receptor
  TGF-βRII, resulting in phosphorylation of the co-receptor TGF-βRI and subsequent
  propagation of the signal. TGF-βRI then phosphorylates serine residues at the C-termini
  of SMAD2 and SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD2/3 residues bind to SMAD4, and the trimeric
  SMAD complex translocates to the nucleus, where it binds SMAD-binding elements (SBEs)
  in the promoters of TGF-β-sensitive genes and drives their expression. The inhibitory
  SMADs (SMAD6 and SMAD7) serve to interfere with the signaling pathway by inhibition
  of the binding and activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 by TGF-βRI. Under non-canonical
  signaling, activation of TGF-βRII/TGF-βRI proceeds, after which other signaling
  pathways follow. One alternative set of pathways are the MAPK pathways, which lead
  ultimately to activation of the MAPK proteins ERK, JNK, or p38, which can then modulate
  canonical TGF-β signaling by phosphorylating the linker domains of SMAD proteins,
  affecting their subcellular localization and activity. Alternatively, the TGF-β/TGF-βR
  pathway can lead to activation of PI3K/Akt, resulting in critical effects on cell
  survival, proliferation, and differentiation, among many others, through downstream
  molecular pathways including activation of mTOR.
