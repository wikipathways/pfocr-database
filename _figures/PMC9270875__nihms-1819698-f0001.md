caption: 'Granulopoiesis is a highly regulated differentiation process, leading to
  the generation of mature neutrophils from hematopoietic stem cells []. Granulocyte
  colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the major cytokine promoting neutrophil differentiation
  in the bone marrow and also regulates salvage NAD+synthesis through upregulation
  of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) []. This increase in NAD+ production
  coincides with engagement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as a result of increased
  oxygen availability. Improved OXPHOS function also occurs due to suppression of
  pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), leading to the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
  by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) []. Regulation of adenylate nucleotides (AMP, ADP,
  and ATP) in the mitochondria by adenylate kinase-2 (AK2) is also necessary for proper
  granulopoiesis, wherein mutations in the gene encoding AK2 lead to reticular dysgenesis,
  a rare genetic disorder resulting in severe combined immunodeficiency []. Autophagy
  also supports mitochondrial respiration during granulopoiesis []. Emergency granulopoiesis
  by pathogen-derived byproducts also influences mature neutrophil metabolism through
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to engage the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and prime
  neutrophils for an oxidative burst once they reach the site of infection. In a similar
  fashion, tumor microenvironment (TME)-derived cytokines, such as G-CSF, chemokine
  (C-X-C motif) ligand 1/2 (CXCL1/2), or interleukin 17 (IL-17), can not only skew
  differentiation of hematopoietic cells toward granulocyte precursors and mature
  neutrophils [], but also promote tissue-specific recruitment to support tumor progression
  and metastasis [–]. More research is needed to understand whether these TME-derived
  cytokines manipulate granulopoiesis-related metabolism or metabolically prime mature
  neutrophils toward an N2, protumor phenotype even before reaching a primary tumor
  or metastatic sites. Abbreviation: GCSFR, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
  receptor.'
