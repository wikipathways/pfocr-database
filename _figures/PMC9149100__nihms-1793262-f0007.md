caption: 'a, Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 (CDK4/6) activity
  induces rewiring of multiple interconnected kinase circuits in tumour cells. First,
  blocking CDK4/6 inhibits RB phosphorylation (1), thereby preventing E2F-mediated
  cell cycle progression. However, multiple mechanisms may counteract these effects.
  For example, decreased phosphorylated-RB levels also lead to enhanced AKT phosphorylation
  by mTORC complex 2 (mTORC2) (2), which can stimulate cell survival mechanisms. Similarly,
  decreased CDK4/6 activity can down-regulate mTORC1 signalling via enhanced tuberous
  sclerosis 2 (TSC2) activity (3), which may lead to loss of negative-feedback regulation
  of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling (4), resulting in up-regulated upstream
  PI3K–AKT pathway activity. In addition, compensatory CDK2-mediated RB phosphorylation
  (5) can stimulate cell cycle progression in the absence of CDK4/6 signalling. b,
  CDK4/6 inhibitors promote tumour cell immunogenicity via multiple mechanisms: (i)
  Metabolic stress and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) up-regulate
  secretion of inflammatory chemokines CC-chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), CXC-chemokine
  ligand 9 (CXCL9) and CXCL10; (ii) hypomethylation and therefore expression of endogenous
  retroviruses (ERVs) induces a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) response, which leads
  to increased expression and secretion of type III interferon (IFN), activation of
  Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling,
  enhanced IFN-driven gene expression, and up-regulation of major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class I expression; and (iii) chromatin remodelling facilitates IFN-mediated
  expression of interferon-responsive genes. 4EBP1; eukaryotic translation initiation
