caption: BMPR signaling. BMPs signal via complexes of type I (BMPRIs) and type II
  (BMPRIIs) transmembrane kinase receptors. The type II receptor, a constitutively
  active kinase (shown in the figure as phosphorylated), phosphorylates (specified
  as P) and activates the type I receptor, upon which intracellular canonical signaling
  is initiated by phosphorylation of receptor‐regulated R‐SMAD1, 5, and 8. Activated
  R‐SMADs partner with SMAD4 to transcriptionally regulate expression of specific
  target genes. BMPR activation can also induce non‐SMAD signaling, e.g. by activating
  p38 and JNK MAP kinases and small GTPases such as Rho and Rac. Each step in the
  pathway is fine‐tuned by positive and negative regulation. For example, ligand bioavailability
  for the receptor can be regulated by ligand‐binding proteins, also called antagonists,
  which sequester the ligand from interacting with receptors. BMP type III receptors
  or accessory co‐receptors can enhance BMP signaling by presenting ligands to type
  I and type II receptors.
