caption: (A) Inactivation of TREX1 resulted in the accumulation of AdMVs in serum,
  deletion of the FCGR2B gene, decreased MYSM1 production in PBMC, and elevated TMEM203
  signaling in T cells were associated with overexpression of the cGAS-STING signaling
  pathway, upregulation of IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and induction
  of SLE; (B) Inactivation of DNase II causes abnormal accumulation of dsDNA, which
  over-activates the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and triggers CIA.
