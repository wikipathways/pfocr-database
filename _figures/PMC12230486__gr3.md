caption: Description of the Interaction Between Macrophages and Other Cells During
  Myocardial HypoxiaHypoxia induces the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
  MCP-1 from myocardial and endothelial cells, attracting monocytes that differentiate
  into macrophages. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) enters macrophages via
  the CD36 receptor, activating the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway and triggering
  an inflammatory response. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) stabilizes and regulates
  the expression of various genes, including proinflammatory factors (such as tumor
  necrosis factor [TNF]-α and interleukin [IL]-1β) and PPARγ, further promoting CD36
  expression and lipid metabolism. ROS activates the NF-κB pathway through Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs), leading to macrophages secreting transforming growth factor (TGF)-β
  and vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf), which regulate endothelial cell function
  and promote myofibroblast formation. This process results in arterial wall necrosis
  and stress, ultimately causing myocardial cell damage and necrosis. MerTK = tyrosine
  kinase Mer; TIMD4+ = TMEM161B-mediated immune defense 4; Treg = T regulatory cell;
  other abbreviations as in Figure 2
