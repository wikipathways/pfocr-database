caption: Merged network analysis from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software for
  associations among molecules related to rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation of joint,
  cell cycle and apoptosis. The merged network of “Rheumatoid arthritis”, “Inflammation
  of joint”, “Apoptosis of chondrocytes” and “Cell cycle progression” categorized
  in the IPA software was obtained from IPA software. The overlay canonical pathway
  of “Role of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and chondrocytes in rheumatoid arthritis” identified
  7 molecules interconnected to networks of RA and cell cycle progress. Among the
  merged network, the down-regulated RGCC in RA chondrocytes participated simultaneously
  in the network of RA, inflammation of joint and cell cycle progression, with additional
  connection to Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), cyclin-dependent kinase
  1 (CDK1) and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), as shown in light blue lines.

  description: Merged network analysis from Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software
    for associations among molecules related to rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation
    of joint, cell cycle and apoptosis. The merged network of “Rheumatoid arthritis”,
    “Inflammation of joint”, “Apoptosis of chondrocytes” and “Cell cycle progression”
    categorized in the IPA software was obtained from IPA software. The overlay canonical
    pathway of “Role of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and chondrocytes in rheumatoid arthritis”
    identified 7 molecules interconnected to networks of RA and cell cycle progress.
    Among the merged network, the down-regulated RGCC in RA chondrocytes participated
    simultaneously in the network of RA, inflammation of joint and cell cycle progression,
    with additional connection to Cyclin B1 (CCNB1), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
    cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), as shown in light
