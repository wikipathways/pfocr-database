caption: 'MicroRNA (miRNA) as a hub of regulatory networks underlying complex disease.
  A single miRNA could simultaneously contribute to the regulation of several components
  of a pathway, multiple pathways in a regulatory network, or even a cluster of diseases.
  The hypothetical regulatory network shown here is an abstraction of the one reported
  in Ref. , which was derived from Bayesian dependency analysis and functional annotation
  of gene expression profiles in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. 1-1, gene #1 in pathway
  #1; 1-6-a, a gene that is co-regulated with gene 1-6 but has not been shown to be
  part of pathway #1.'
