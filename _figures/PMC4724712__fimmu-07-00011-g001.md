caption: Tregalizumab is able to activate the suppressive capacity of regulatory T
  cells. (A) Tregs were isolated and pre-incubated with plate-bound tregalizumab,
  OKT-3 mAb, or medium and transferred to a mixed lymphocyte reaction using allogeneic,
  CD3-depleted, irradiated PBMCs to activate the proliferation of Teffs. (B) The proliferation
  of allogenic stimulated Teffs with tregalizumab pretreated Tregs is shown compared
  with the proliferation without Tregs. (C) Tregalizumab engages the TCR signaling
  pathway. Incubation of Tregs with tregalizumab evokes signaling events in Tregs
  that mimic a signal through the T cell receptor complex without the need for direct
  CD3 or TCR stimulation. T cell receptor complex signaling represents a crucial event
  in the activation of Tregs since blockade of the corresponding signaling pathway
  resulted in the loss of suppressive activity of Tregs. Tregalizumab delivers a comparable
  signal as usually conferred by TCR binding in Tregs, resulting in activation/phosphorylation
  of the T cell receptor downstream signaling molecule ZAP-70 (ζ-chain-associated
  protein). This event leads to signals that finally trigger internalization of the
  tregalizumab–CD4 complex. As a consequence, CD4 expression levels on CD4+ T cells
  are downmodulated by tregalizumab in the physiological setting. This downmodulation
  causes a transient decrease of CD4 molecules on the cell surface, which is followed
  by a recovery of expression levels over time (, ).
