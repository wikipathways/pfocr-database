caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming of T cells, leading to greater regulatory versus
  effector phenotype: schematic model for metformin and statin involvement. Regulation
  of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway by AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) after metformin administration promotes fatty acid metabolism,
  which is the preferred energy pathway used by regulatory T cells (Tregs) but not
  naive or T effector cells. One study reported that human Treg cells from patients
  taking statins exhibited decreased phosphorylation of mTOR and a preclinical investigation
  noted that simvastatin demethylates the Foxp3 promoter locus in mice. Th, T helper
  cells.'
