caption: Compartmentalization of the AOS and HPL branches of the Vick and Zimmerman
  pathway in plants. (a) Under unperturbed conditions, the link between LOX2 and AOS
  is less strong, causing a portion of 13-HPOT to leak out of the enzymatic channel.
  The free 13-HPOT serves as substrate for HPL to produce green leaf volatiles. (b)
  In response to herbivory, however, the amount of chloroplastic AOS and AOC increases,
  effectively recruiting LOX2 into the LOX2–AOS–AOC complex. This prevents leakage
  of 13-HPOT and consequently promotes cis-(+)-OPDA production.
