caption: 'Simplified mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways highlighting protein
  synthesis initiation. The TSC responds to external growth signals to regulate the
  major mTORC1 growth pathway. Rapamycin binds to the immunophilin FKBP12, which then
  binds to mTORC1 to inhibit S6K/S6 ribosome synthesis and mRNA elongation but not
  4E-BP/eIF4E mRNA translation initiation. In LAM cells, mutations in TSC genes result
  in de-repression of the GTPase Rheb and hyperactivation of mTOR in mTORC1. Ribosome
  biogenesis and function are regulated by the kinase S6K1 and its substrate S6, which
  are activated by the Raptor-guided, rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation at S6K1Thr389,
  which in turn phosphorylates the ribosome protein S6240/244. Nonphosphorylated 4E-BP
  binds the oncogenic initiation factor eIF4E. Rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation
  of 4E-BP1 by mTORC1 on Thr37/46 results in the release of eIF4E from 4E-BP1. eIF4E
  binds to the scaffold protein eIF4G and, along with eIF4A, forms the eIF4F translation
  initiation complex. eIF4E binds to 5′ methyl-7-G-capped (m7G) mRNAs and the helicase
  eIF4A unwinds the secondary mRNA structure. Highly eIF4E-dependent translation includes
  mRNAs for Myc, proliferative, anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic proteins. Rictor
  in mTORC2 prevents rapamycin inhibition of mTOR in this complex and mTOR in this
  complex phosphorylates many proteins in a rapamycin-insensitive fashion, including
  AKT Ser473, which is a biomarker of mTORC2 activity. White balls indicate rapamycin-insensitive
  phosphorylation sites; black balls represent rapamycin-sensitive phosphorylation
  sites. The blue helical and wavy line represents eIF4E-dependent mRNAs. 4E-BP: eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein; eIF4E: eukaryotic translation initiation factor
