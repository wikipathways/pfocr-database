caption: 'Classical view of the major players in the system that regulates intracellular
  Ca2+ compartmentalization. Cellular Ca2+ import through the plasma membrane occurs
  largely by receptor-operated (for example, glutamate receptors), voltage-sensitive
  and store-operated channels. Once inside the cell, Ca2+ can either interact with
  Ca2+-binding proteins or become sequestered into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  or mitochondria. The largest Ca2+ store in cells is found in the ER or sarcoplasmic
  reticulum, with local Ca2+ concentrations reaching millimolar levels. Ca2+ levels
  in the ER are affected by the relative distribution of sarco(endo)plasmatic reticulum
  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pumps and of inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate (Ins(1, 4, 5)P3)
  receptors (Ins(1, 4, 5)P3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RYRs), as well as by the relative
  abundance of Ca2+-binding proteins (calreticulin, calsequestrin) in the ER or sarcoplasmic
  reticulum. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in unstimulated cells is kept at approximately
  100 nM by both uptake into the ER and Ca2+ extrusion into the extracellular space
  by the plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA). ER Ca2+ release is triggered by agonist
  stimulation through the generation of Ins(1, 4, 5)P3 through hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate
  (PtdIns(4,5)P2) operated by a phospholipase C (PLCγ). The mitochondria take up Ca2+
  electrophoretically through a uniport transporter and can release it again through
  3 different pathways: reversal of the uniporter, Na+/H+-dependent Ca2+ exchange,
  or as a consequence of permeability transition pore (PTP) opening. The PTP can also
  flicker to release small amounts of Ca2+. Ca2+ efflux from cells is regulated primarily
  by the PMCA, which binds calmodulin and has a high affinity for Ca2+. Ca2+ efflux
  might also be mediated by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). [Ca2+], calcium concentration;
  DAG, diacylglyceride. This figure was kindly provided by Prof. S. Orrenius. It served
  as the template for a figure in: Orrenius, S., Zhivotovsky, B., Nicotera, P. (2003).
  Nature Reviews of Cell Biology 4, 552–556. The figure was slightly modified by adding
  the red dots with FLS, suggesting a role for endogenous sesquiterpenoids (FLS) as
  agonists for Ca2+-ATPases. Such role is more probable for SERCAs than for PMCAs
  (hence the question mark).With copyright permission for both the figure and the
  legend from the publisher and from Prof. S. Orrenius.'
