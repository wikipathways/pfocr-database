caption: Scheme of metabolic pathways where enzymes either upregulated (black boxes)
  or downregulated (white boxes) in LP are highlighted. Upregulation of central carbon
  metabolism enzymes suggests an increased availability of primary metabolite intermediates
  and ATP, GTP, NAD(P)H and FADH2 for anabolic processes under LP condition. Enzymes
  related to the synthesis of balhimycin precursors (red rectangles), such as Leu,
  Tyr, Asn, DPG and HPG and amino sugars, were upregulated during antibiotic production.
  Reactions are reported according to KEGG and BioCy metabolic pathway databases.
  Enzyme name abbreviations refer to Table 3 S (Additional file 1).
