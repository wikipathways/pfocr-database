caption: Activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) and voltage-gated
  Ca++ channels leads to influx of Ca++ and activation of the ras-MEK-ERK signaling
  cascade in adult neurons. This leads to activation of CREB-mediated transcription
  via intermediary actions of RSK2 or the Mitogen Stimulated Kinase, MSK. A downstream
  target of these kinases, CREB, is postulated to facilitate transcription through
  interaction with CREB-binding protein (CBP) and acetylation of histones. Additional
  pathways for regulating chromatin structure in memory include metabotropic glutamate
  receptor (mGluR) and NMDAR activation of Protein Kinase M zeta (PKMzeta) and downstream
  targeting of NFkappaB signaling in the nucleus. ERK MAPK signaling can also activate
  this pathway as an ancillary mechanism for chromatin regulation. Targets of this
  pathway include the transcription factors c-rel and Elk-1, which can regulate the
  expression of the MAPK Phosphatase MKP-3, which represents a likely site of negative
  feedback control of the pathway. See text and () for additional discussion.
