caption: 'Cluster analysis for DSF-modulated targets. A total of nine clusters were
  enriched, of which six were associated with RF. The following were the associations
  of clusters in biological pathways of RF. Cluster 1: Mixed, incl. glutathione metabolism
  and detoxification of reactive oxygen species; Cluster 2: chemokine receptors bind
  chemokines; Cluster 3: prostaglandin metabolism and leukotriene receptor activity;
  Cluster 4: extracellular matrix organization; Cluster 5: elastic fiber formation
  and matrix metalloproteinases; and Cluster 6: steroid hormone biosynthesis and arachidonic
  acid monooxygenase activity'
