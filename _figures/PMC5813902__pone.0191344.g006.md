caption: (A) The steps of glycolysis and ether lipid synthesis. The numbers indicate
  enzymes linked to panel (B). The question mark indicates that no homolog is identified
  in the previous study []. (B) The spectral counts of the related proteins identified
  from each gland. The pathway numbers are linked to panel (A). p., predicted.
