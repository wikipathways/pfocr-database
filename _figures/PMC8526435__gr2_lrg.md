caption: A schematic layout on STAT dependent IFN-1 signalling, a key contributor
  to the cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and the action of IVM.
  A) The IFN-I signalling pathway showing JAK1 and TYK2 being activated upon binding
  of Interferon-1 (IFN-I) at the IFN-1 receptor (IFN-IR). In a normal scenario, STAT1
  is predominantly activated to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)-(STAT1-ISGs)
  via (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9) complex, known as ISGF3 (not shown here). STAT3 activation
  is also present here albeit small. B) Upon SARS-CoV-2 infection the activity of
  STAT1 is inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 proteins (NSP1 and ORF6), leading to the upregulation
  of STAT3 activity that subsequently induces STAT3-ISGs. Following this, the PIAS1
  and PIAS3 regulate the binding activity of STAT1 and STAT3 to the DNA respectively,
  via negative feedback. However, upon infection, the hyperactivation of STAT3 represses
  the miR-34a, an inhibitor for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), inadvertently
  enhancing the level of PAI-1, which in turn inhibits the activity of PIAS3. To further
  stress, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) produced from the reduced STAT1
  activity also activates STAT3, leading to enhanced production of cytokine and chemokines.
  Here, IVM inhibits STAT3 activity, subsequently reducing inflammatory IL-6 cytokine
  production, preventing cytokine storm and ADRS. IVM also binds to the viral S protein,
  thereby prohibiting the attachment of S protein to the host ACE2 receptors for viral
  entry and reducing the viral load.
