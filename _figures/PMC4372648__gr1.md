caption: 'Three core signaling pathways altered in malignant gliomas. DNA alterations
  and copy number changes in the RTK/RAS/PI3K, RB, and p53 are shown. Moreover, activating
  genetic alterations are indicated in red, and inactivating genetic alterations are
  indicated in purple. In each pathway, the altered components and the type of alteration
  are indicated. The types of alteration are represented by different patterns as
  follows:  represents mutation,  represents amplification and  represents homozygous
  deletion, while  represents gene with normal copy number. MG indicates malignant
  glioma; HER, human epithelial receptor; MET, mesenchymal epithelial transition factor.'
