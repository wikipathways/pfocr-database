caption: Schematic of the signal transduction pathways associated with epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). TGFβ and RTK ligands mediate signaling in liver cells, playing
  pivotal roles as upstream mediators for inflammation, growth, cytoskeletal rearrangement,
  proliferation, reducing cell–cell adhesion, and metastasis. TGFβ induces the Smad
  signaling cascade to block E-cadherin, which is a strong blocker of EMT transition.
  Additionally, both TGF and RTKs can mediate inflammation by inducing SNAL/SNAG and
  by activating FOXk1 and Cyr61. Hence, inducing EMT via epigenetic changes results
  in the activation of α-SMA, N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin. Stem cell signature
  is also further affected as miR-7 works in concert with Twist to block let-7 and
  activate miR-10b. Because of inflammatory loopback signaling, HIF-1a, along with
  IL-8, is no longer induced. Through this response, miR-34 is downregulated and miR-200c
  is upregulated, leading to the activation of ZEB1 (activator of EMT), which then
  upregulates SMARC4, setting up the pathway for metastasis. Furthermore, ZEB1 activation
  is responsible for TGFβ, NOTCH, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, which then
  leads to proliferation.
