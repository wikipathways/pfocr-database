caption: 'Multifactorial pathogenesis of primary Sjögren’s syndrome: interferons as
  culprits in the self-amplifying pathogenic loop. A damage trigger such as stress
  or infection leads to accumulating apoptotic debris, inducing rapid interferon (IFN)
  type I production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). IFN type I then binds
  to IFNα,β receptor (IFNAR) on adjacent target cells, which induces an IFN signature
  and IFN-primed mature effector cells, amongst others, by perpetuating the TLR7 pathway
  in autoreactive plasma cells as well as self-amplification in the pDCs. TLR7 upregulation
  in autoreactive plasma cells increases RNA-associated autoantibody production (SSA/Ro52,
  SSA/Ro60 and SSB/La). These RNA-associated autoantibodies form immune complexes
  together with self-apoptotic debris, further triggering the TLR7 pathway. Prolonged
  inflammation can lead to exhaustion of the complement system with decreased complement-mediated
  solubilisation and further accumulation of immune complexes. Neutrophils can cause
  further tissue damage by forming neutrophil extracellular traps, these netting neutrophils
  also being potent inducers of IFN type I production. Autoantibodies induce netting
  of IFN-primed neutrophils, further amplifying the loop. IFN-primed dendritic cells
  (DCs) activate T cells, as well as natural killer and natural killer T cells (data
  not shown), to produce vast amounts of IFN type II (IFNγ). Although TLRs are widely
  considered the usual suspects in autoimmune pathophysiology, recently the cytoplasmic
  RIG-I-like family of helicases (RLHs), RIG-I (DDX58) and MDA5 (IFIH1) have been
  gaining the spotlight as co-conspirators. Evidence points towards a collaborative
  effort between TLRs and RLHs, together enhancing inappropriate self-recognition
  and sustained IFN overactivation. IFIH1 upregulation has been identified in IFN-positive
  pDCs of primary Sjögren’s syndrome patients (unpublished data), as previously in
  glands of Sjögren’s syndrome-like (C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2) mice []. This IFN-driven
  pathogenic loop in primary Sjögren’s syndrome, in part driven by aberrant sensing
  of nucleic acids, can potentially lead to functional decline or even loss of function
  in target tissues. APRIL, a proliferation inducing ligand; BAFF, B-cell activating
  factor; IL, interleukin; MDA5, melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; MHC,
