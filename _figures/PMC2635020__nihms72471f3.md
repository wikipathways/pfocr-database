caption: The over-expressed pCD escapes normal targeting pathways and is secreted
  by the cancer cells. A small portion of secreted pCD is endocytosed via M6PR pathway,
  while majority of secreted pCD is recognized by a yet unidentified cell surface
  receptor [,,,]. This interaction activates MAPK signaling pathway [,] that results
  in differential expression of cancer promoting genes including various cytokines
  and NFKB2 [–]. This, in turn, stimulates tumor growth and invasion. pCD secreted
  by cancer cells is also captured by stromal cells and promotes fibroblast proliferation,
  motility and invasion that results in cancer progression []. Moreover, secreted
  pCD may also enhance angiogenesis by stimulation of endothelial cells [] or by enzymatic
  processing of angiogenic factors (after pCD → CD activation in acidic extracellular
  milieu) [–].
