caption: Proposed mechanism for fatty acid-mediated modulation of endothelial cell
  activation induced by TNFα. Omega-6 or omega-3 fatty acids can differentially modulate
  TNFα-induced up-regulation of caveolin-1 and the activation of TNFR-1 mediated signaling
  pathway, which includes induction of oxidative stress (ROS), p38 MAPK, NF-κB and
  COX-2. TNF-α induced cell signaling and PGE2 production are further enhanced by
  linoleic acid but blocked by α-linolenic acid. Finally, targeted knockdown of caveolin-1
  completely abrogates TNF-α-induced PGE2 production, indicating that caveolin-1 plays
  a mechanistic role in TNF-α-induced endothelial cell activation and modification
  by dietary fatty acids.
