caption: TG2-mediated adhesion/signaling at the cell surface. The solid black arrows
  indicate TG2-mediated activation of signaling. The dotted black line indicates binding
  of activated PKCα to the integrin cytoplasmic tails, causing their redistribution
  on the cell surface. The dashed gray arrows outline activation of syndecan-2 by
  intracellular PKCα and syndecan-2-mediated activation of ROCK, which induces stress
  fiber and focal adhesion formation. The dashed black arrow indicates nuclear translocation
  of β-catenin, which leads to complex formation with Tcf/Lef and activation of gene
  transcription. The dashed double black line indicates the unknown pathway of GPR56-induced
  Gαq activation, which inhibits tumor cell growth and metastasis. The flat-headed
  arrows indicate inhibition of signaling.
