caption: atRAL is a major byproduct of the retinoid cycle with cellular toxicity.
  Any events, which induce delay of atRAL clearance from photoreceptors, cause excess
  accumulation of atRAL resulting in mitochondria mediated apoptotic cell death. In
  atRAL mediated cell death pathway, following cellular events can be involved. Excess
  levels of atRAL can activate G protein coupled receptors (GPCR), which increase
  [Ca2+]i levels via PLC/IP3signaling. Increase of [Ca2+]i cause ROS production via
  NADPH oxidase activation, which can be attenuated by 2-APB. Next, ROS can induce
  DNA damage resulting in p53 phosphorylation. Finally, phosphorylated p53 can activate
  Bax, resulting in mitochondrial apoptotic cell death. Bax activation can be reduced
  by Bax inhibitory peptide.
