caption: Pathway for CoA biosynthesis and the addition of the prosthetic group to
  ACP. Active uptake of pantothenate by a sodium-dependent permease (the panF gene
  product) is an alternate route to intracellular pantothenate, which is then either
  used for CoA biosynthesis or exported from the cells by a separate transport system.
  Pantothenate kinase (the coaA gene product) is the first, and most highly regulated,
  step in CoA biosynthesis and is regulated by feedback inhibition by CoA and its
  thioesters. Cysteine is then added to 4′-phosphopanthenate to generate 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine,
  which is then decarboxylated to yield 4′-phosphopantetheine. Both reactions are
  catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme, phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase/phosphopantothenoylcyteine
  decarboxylase (the coaBC gene product). 4′-Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase
  (the coaD gene product) is a secondary regulatory point and is responsible for the
  formation of dephospho-CoA, which is then phosphorylated on the 3′-hydroxyl group
  to yield CoA by the dephospho-CoA kinase (the coaE gene product). CoA is then used
  as the 4′-phosphopantetheine donor in the synthesis of ACP from apo-ACP catalyzed
  by ACP synthase (the acpS gene product). The 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group
  of ACP undergoes rapid metabolic turnover mediated by the ACP phosphodiesterase
  (the acpH gene product), generating apo-ACP and 4′-phosphopantetheine. The direct
  degradation of CoA to 4′-phosphopantetheine occurs during abrupt metabolic transitions.
  4′-Phosphopantetheine is either reused for CoA synthesis or excreted from the cell.
  4′-Phosphopantetheine accumulates in the growth medium since E. coli does not have
  an uptake system for this intermediate.
