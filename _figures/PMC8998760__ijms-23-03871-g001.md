caption: 'The interplay between PARP inhibitors (PARPis) and immune checkpoint inhibitors
  (ICIs). When double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) occur and PARPis block PARP complex,
  DNA fragments accumulate in the cytoplasm. As a result, neo-antigens accumulate
  on the cell surface, where they are recognized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs),
  activating the immune response. Moreover, the Stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
  pathway is activated: DNA fragments are recognized by cytosolic sensor cGMP-AMP
  synthetase (cGAS), cGAS activates 2′-5′ cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), cGAMP switches on
  STING, STING modulates transcription factors such as Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB),
  and Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), resulting in the transcription of related
  cytokines (Interferon [IFN], IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNFα]), promoting
  immune response. IFN increases the expression of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)
  on the cell surface. The activation of the sensor system Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated
  (ATM)-ATR Serine/Threonine Kinase (ATR)-Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1) in case of DSBs,
  and the STAT-IRF pathway, increase PD-L1. Finally, DSBs inactivate glycogen synthase
  kinase 3-beta (GSK3β), responsible for PD-L1 proteasomal degradation, increasing
  PD-L1 cellular expression. These modifications result in a more immune responsive
  TME: increased surface neo-antigens, increased PD-L1 expression, cytokines, and
  chemotactic factors determine an increase in number and function of APCs, T-cells,
  NK cells, and decrease in immunosuppressive elements such as myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells and M2 macrophages.'
