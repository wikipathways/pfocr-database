caption: Efferocytosis in immune cells. Efferocytosis is involved in the body's anti‐infective
  immunity and suppression of inflammation development. It is closely related to immune
  cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and Treg. (a) Macrophages are the primary
  cells that exercise efferocytosis. They ingest and degrade dying cells, limiting
  cell necrosis. Meanwhile, efferocytosis also has an effect on macrophages. First,
  efferocytosis induces macrophage proliferation, a process realized by two independent
  pathways. In the first pathway, DNase2a in the phagolysosomes formed by macrophages
  after ingestion of dying cells hydrolyzes DNA from dying cells to produce nucleotides.
  The nucleotides activate the DNA–PKcs–mTORC2 pathway, which increases the pro‐proliferative
  transcription factor Myc. Myc upregulates Bhlhe40 and downregulates c‐Maf, thereby
  promoting proliferation of non‐inflammatory macrophages. This pathway also requires
  additional stimulation by MerTK‐ERK1/2. The second pathway is efferocytosis‐induced
  production of lactate that promotes Myc protein stabilization via GPR132. In addition,
  macrophages can utilize methionine produced by degraded dying cells to promote tissue
  inflammation reduction. Activation of CD36 by dying cells induces ERK phosphorylation,
  which activates the Ptgs2–PGE2–TGF‐β pathway. However, the ERK–Dusp4 negative feedback
  pathway reduces ERK phosphorylation. Fortunately, methionine produced during efferocytosis
  is converted to SAM, which is used by DNMT3A to methylate Dusp4. As a result, Dusp4
  is inhibited and the Ptgs2–PGE2–TGF‐β pathway is enhanced. (b) Treg is involved
  in the modulation of efferocytosis. IL‐13 secreted by Treg stimulates macrophages
  to secrete IL‐10, which induces an increase in the expression of Vav1 in macrophages.
  Vav1 activates Rac1, which in turn leads to actin rearrangement within the macrophage
  cell membrane and enhances efferocytosis. In addition, TGF‐β and IL‐10 secreted
  by macrophages can increase Treg population. (c) When tissue is infected or injured,
  neutrophils are recruited from the vasculature to the site of inflammation. Large
  numbers of neutrophils accumulate at the site of inflammation, and some of these
  neutrophils undergo apoptosis. Macrophages remove apoptotic neutrophils through
  efferocytosis and secrete anti‐inflammatory cytokines to limit the development of
  tissue inflammation. In addition, when pathogens invade, neutrophils release NETs
  to capture the pathogens. NETs can eventually be phagocytosed and cleared by macrophages.
  Alternatively, neutrophils can also exert efferocytosis. Pathogen infection induces
  macrophages to undergo pyroptosis. Pyroptotic macrophages form PIT to capture bacteria.
  Complement mediates neutrophil recruitment to the PIT site. Subsequently, neutrophils
  clear the PIT through efferocytosis
