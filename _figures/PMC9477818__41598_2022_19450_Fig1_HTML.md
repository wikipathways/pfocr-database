caption: Silkworm immune response against Gram-negative bacteria through α-helical
  cationic AMPs. In B. mori L., Gram-negative bacteria or meso-diaminopimelic acid
  (DAP)-type peptidoglycan recognized by both pattern recognition receptors (PRRs),
  peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LC (membrane-associated) and peptidoglycan
  recognition protein (PGRP)-LE (cytosolic) triggers sequential activation of melanization
  (1) and AMP production by IMD pathway (2), respectively. Melanin formation starts
  with the activation of the serine-protease cascade, which leads to the activation
  of the prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPAE). The prophenoloxidase-activating
  enzyme (PPAE) helps to activate the phenoloxidase (PO) from prophenoloxidase (Pro-PO)
  (inactive). PO is actively involved in the melanization process through the formation
  of intermediate quinone products with the help of dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and dopachrome
  conversion enzyme (DCE). Serpin (serine protease inhibitor) inhibits PO formation.
  By contrast, the Imd pathway is also involved in AMP production upon Gram-negative
  bacteria infection. Polymeric DAP‐type peptidoglycan (Poly-PGN) binds to PGRP-LC
  protein (dimer), and monomeric DAP‐type peptidoglycan (Mono-PGN) binds to PGRP-LE
  protein. Extra and intracellular PGRP-LE activate the PGRP-LC dependent and independent
  Imd pathway, respectively. Imd interacts with FADD (Fas-associated protein with
  death domain) that, subsequently, recruits the caspase DREDD (FADD-death-related
  ced-3/Nedd2-like protein). DREDD cleaves Imd, which is then activated by K63-ubiquitination.
  The K63-polyubiquitin chains connect with TAB2 (TAK1-associated binding protein
  (2) to recruit and activate the TAK1 (transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-activated
  kinase (1).TAK1 subsequently activates the IKK (inhibitor of B kinase) complex,
  which phosphorylates the NF-κB-like nuclear factor Relish. Free Relish moves into
  the nucleus and stimulates the transcriptionof AMP coding genes. AMPs produced during
  immunization with P. aeruginosa could cause bacterial cell death through two possible
  mechanisms, i.e., bacterial cell membrane damage (3) and intracellular killing (4)
  by interaction with intracellular targets to compromise cell viability (Created
