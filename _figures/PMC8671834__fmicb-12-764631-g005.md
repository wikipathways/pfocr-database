caption: Metabolic pathways of Ca. A. pyornia. This organism contains the complete
  Wood–Ljungdahl pathway for carbon fixation, hydrogenases, and no carbohydrate or
  lipid importers. It is predicted that this organism is able to take advantage of
  hydrogen production on Fe2+-bearing minerals like olivine as they react with seawater.
  Hydrogen and bicarbonate can be funneled into the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway to produce
  acetyl-CoA for biosynthesis and energy. This organism is missing many amino acid
  synthesis pathways and likely needs to import these for biosynthesis or energy.
  Individual transport or regulatory systems pathways (denoted by lower case letters
  here) are listed in – and – under the headings that match the labels in this figure.
