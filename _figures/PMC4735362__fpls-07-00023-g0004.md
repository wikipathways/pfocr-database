caption: Simplified scheme of the interaction between sulfur assimilation, ethylene
  and glutathione biosynthesis in plants. Sulfur is taken up from the soil as sulfate,
  which is converted into adenosine 5-phosphosulfate by the enzyme ATP sulfurylase
  (ATPS). This is further reduced by adenosine 5-phosphosulfate reductase (APR) into
  sulfite, which is subsequently reduced into sulfide by sulfite reductase (SiR).
  The enzyme O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase (OASTL) produces cysteine, which is one
  of the three building blocks that make up glutathione. During glutathione biosynthesis,
  cysteine is coupled to glutamate by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GSH1) to form
  γ-glutamylcysteine. In the next step, glycine is added by glutathione synthetase
  (GSH2) to finally produce glutathione. In addition, cysteine is also required for
  ethylene formation, as methionine is derived from cysteine via different reactions
  (depicted by the dashed arrow). In the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, methionine
  is converted to S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) by SAM synthetase. In the next steps,
  1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is produced by ACC synthase (ACS) and
  subsequently oxidized by ACC oxidase (ACO) to form ethylene (see Figure ). As ethylene
  and glutathione fulfill important functions in metal-exposed plants, a trade-off
  between both might lie at the heart of their interaction regulating plant responses
  to metal stress.
