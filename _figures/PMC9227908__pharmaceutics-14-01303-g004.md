caption: Role of hypoxia inducible factor-1 in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming.
  Hypoxia modifies cell metabolism through the expression of HIF-1α, which influences
  tumor angiogenesis, cancer cell migration, invasion, and glycolytic metabolism.
  In addition to this, HIF-1α can be activated by TGF-β action via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway, and at the same time, HIF-1α can activate TGF-β in a positive feedback
  loop. Among the most important metabolic changes produced by HIF-1α are increased
  glucose uptake, glycolysis, and decreased glucose oxidation through the induction
  of GLUT 1/4/8, PKF, HK 1/2, and PGK1. There is also an increase in lactate and NAD+
  production through LDH. Together, an increase in MCT4 expression contributes to
  lactate efflux. Another effect of HIF-1α expression is the suppression of mitochondrial
  function, resulting from inactivation of the TCA cycle, inhibition of PGC1 β, and
  repression of ISCU 1/2 by miR-210. Finally, HIF-1α promotes abnormal fatty acid
  synthesis through overexpression of FASN, which is mediated by increased SREBP-1
  activation. HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1; TGF-β, transforming growth factor
