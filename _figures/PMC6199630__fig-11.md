caption: Interplay between Ca2+ and radiation-induced oxidative stress [extensively
  reviewed in Decrock et al. ()]. Irradiation increases the intracellular Ca2+ level
  (oscillations or single transient changes occurring within minutes to days after
  irradiation). Radiation-induced ATP release by irradiated cells can activate ATP-gated
  P2X receptor cation channels (P2X receptors) present on the cell membrane, thus
  allowing Ca2+ entry into the cell. It can also activate P2Y receptors that have
  been identified as phospholipase C activators. Ca2+ can also be released from the
  ER through calcium-induced calcium release mechanisms that involve IP3Rs or RyRs.
  IP3 is produced (with diacylglycerol) during hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C. Phospholipase C is activated by Ca2+,
  GPCRs, ROS, RNS, receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (e.g., HER1 and 3). Ca2+
  can activate ion channels and binds to calmodulin before activation of the serine/threonine
  protein phosphatase calcineurin. Ca2+ can also activate protein kinase C that in
  turn activates, by phosphorylation, the MAPK pathway and phospholipase A2, at the
  origin of COX-2 activity modulation. It can activate transcription factors (NF-κB,
  AP1) that promote various downstream pathways (iNOS, COX-2). Released Ca2+ can also
  be taken up by mitochondria via VDAC and MCU and modulation by the ER-mitochondria-tethering
  proteins GRP75 (mitochondrial heat shot protein HSP70) and MFN 1 and 2 (involved
  in mitochondrial fusion). The increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ level is accompanied
  by ROS, an RNS increase, mtDNA damage, altered ATP synthesis, mitochondrial depolarization,
  and release of cytochrome C and caspase 3 that will amplify IP3R activity. COX-2,
  cyclooxygenase-2; GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide
  synthase; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; IP3Rs, IP3 receptors; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MCU, mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter; MFN, mitofusin; NF-κB, nuclear
  factor kappa B; RyRs, ryanodine receptors; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel.
