caption: Hypothetical model. Ca2+-influx through TRPV6 channels controls peripheral
  actomyosin bundles and integrity of epithelial sheets through mediating phosphorylation
  of myosin light chain kinase, MLCII. This could take place through Ca2+/Calmodulin
  (CaM)-dependent kinases, CaMKII and CaMKKII as phosphorylation of CaMKII as well
  as phosphorylation of AMPK, a downstream target of CaMKKII, were affected by TRPV6
  depletion. CaMKII has been linked to the activities of both MLCK and RhoA/ROCK pathway
  that direct MLCII phosphorylation,–. Additionally, AMPK has been linked to the phosphorylation
  status of MLCII,. Besides controlling maintenance and contractility of actomyosin
  bundles though MLCII phosphorylation, TRPV6 levels were directly associated with
  the phosphorylation of vimentin, related to cell motility, as well as the expression
  levels of several EMT-linked factors that could possibly impact mesenchymal migration
  of the cells. One possible link in between TRPV6 and EMT markers could be EGFR/PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway that is also downstream of other Ca2+-influx channels (reviewed
  in). TRPV6 thus controls epithelial integrity through at least two parallel pathways.
