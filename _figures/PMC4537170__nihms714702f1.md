caption: 'The mammalian base excision repair and single-strand break repair pathways.
  Base excision repair (BER) begins by the removal of the damaged base by a monofunctional
  or bifunctional DNA glycosylase to leave an AP site (AP). After excision by a monofunctional
  glycosylase, APE1 cleaves the DNA backbone 5′ of the AP site. Base excision by a
  bifunctional DNA glycosylase is followed by incision 3′ to the AP site by either
  β- or β,δ-elimination via intrinsic 3′-AP lyase activity of NTH1, OGG1, or NEIL1.
  The 3′ or 5′ ends then undergo end processing by POLβ, APE1, or PNKP, depending
  on the obstructive termini. PARP1 recognizes such single-strand breaks, and end
  processing may utilize other factors such as TDP1 or APTX. After end processing,
  the BER pathway diverges into two sub-pathways: short-patch or long-patch. In short-patch
  BER, the single-nucleotide gap is repaired by POLβ in coordination with the scaffold
  protein/ligase complex of XRCC1/LIG3α. In long-patch BER, following strand-displacement
  synthesis of 2–13 nucleotides by POLβ and/or Polδ/ε (aided by PCNA and RFC), the
  5′-DNA flap is removed by FEN1 and the backbone is subsequently ligated by LIG1.
  See text for additional details.'
