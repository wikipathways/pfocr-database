caption: The activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway promotes cell proliferation and
  survival through transcriptional upregulation of p85α (Pik3r1), p110α (Pik3ca),
  and Akt1 as well as through direct interaction of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT5
  with the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K. The JAK1-mediated activation of STAT3
  controls the expression of the shorter p50/55α (Pik3r1) regulatory subunits of PI3K
  during mammary gland involution. The persistent activation of STAT5, p110α, and
  AKT1 promotes a sustained survival of epithelial cells despite the tyrosine phosphorylation
  of STAT3 and transcriptional activation of its downstream targets. This may explain
  why these potent survival factors are protooncogenes. The precise mechanisms by
  which p50/55α may modulate PI3 kinase signaling and contribute mammary gland remodeling
  in the absence of active STAT5 needs further investigation.
