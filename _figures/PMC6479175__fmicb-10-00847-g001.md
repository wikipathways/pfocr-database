caption: SLP-related pathways reconstructed from the metagenome sequences of the ruminal
  microbiome. (A) Glucose metabolism; (B) propanoate metabolism; (C) butanoate metabolism.
  The numbers in the boxes represent the EC numbers of pathway enzymes. The box in
  pink refers to the SLP enzymes. The box in blue refers to the electron transporter.
  The box in yellow refers to NADH oxidase during glucose fermentation. Light blue
  background indicates the key steps of the specific fermentation pathway. ThPP is
  the abbreviation of meso-5, 10, 15, 20-tetra (4-hydroxylphenyl) porphyrin. KO numbers
  and gene annotation of the enzymes are shown in .
