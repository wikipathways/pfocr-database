caption: Ced-1 may coordinate multiple mechanisms to link innate immunity to the Unfolded
  Protein Response. During pathogen infection, Ced-1 mediated-engulfment and ER delivery
  of self or non-self ‘damage signals’ might trigger the Unfolded Protein Response,
  possibly through acute elevation of ER protein load. Increased expression of UPR
  target genes, such as ER chaperones and Abu genes might, in turn, might be required
  to facilitate the folding and/or maturation of secreted antimicrobial peptides,
  which are also induced by pathogen infection via a conserved p38 MAP kinase signaling
  pathway. Ced-1 might also regulate immune responses through interactions with other
  cellular mechanisms, such as ERAD, secretory pathways, or direct regulation of MAP
  kinase-controlled AMP production.
