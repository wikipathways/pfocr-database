caption: 'Compartment model of a mylinated spiral ganglion cell (SGC) and its position
  in the human cochlea. A: scheme of a type I cell. Myelinated segments are shown
  in gray. Excitable (active) membranes with high ion channel densities (red segments)
  in the peripheral terminal P0 and in the nodes of Ranvier are needed for spike amplification.
  B: Electrical network model. The currents are defined by extracellular potential
  Ve, intracellular potential Vi, membrane capacitance Cm, membrane conductance Gm
  and intracellular resistance R. Natural excitation by synaptic current from a hair
  cell ribbon synapse is simulated as current injection into the first compartment
  (peripheral terminal P0). For natural excitation all extracellular potentials Ve
  are assumed to be zero. For nonmyelinated type II cells the same approach was used
  with uniform ion channel densities as in the original Hodgkin-Huxley model and with
  constant compartment lengths in the axons. C (left): Cross-section of a human cochlea
  with two dimensional pathway of the model neuron. Active compartments of the central
  axon are indicated as C0 (postsomatic segment), C1, C2, etc. The modeled SGC can
  be activated either by current injection in P0 or by currents from the stimulating
  electrode. C (right): Simulated neural activities are recorded at distance zel from
  the midmodiolar plane.'
