caption: 'Metabolomics changes due to SAR-CoV-2 are predictors of patient acute and
  long-term outcomes and reflect a bioenergetic crisis likely due to viral hijacking
  of the mitochondria. a) Metabolomics changes found due to SARS-CoV-2 infections
  commonly lead to disruption of the kynurenine pathway, TCA cycle and the urea cycle.
  It is unknown if arginine is converted to citrulline and NO; however, due to the
  increase in ornithine and creatine, Jia et al. [] speculate that the urea cycle
  metabolises arginine instead of the NO producing pathway. b) SARS-CoV-2 is internalised
  into the cell via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Many viral
  proteins, including ORF7a and ORF9b locate within the mitochondria. These proteins
  can inhibit RIG1-MAVS (retinoic acid-inducible gene I-mitochondrial antiviral signalling
  protein)-dependent interferon signalling, enhance viral replication and disrupt
  mitochondrial function. This can ultimately lead to cell death via apoptosis, necrosis
  or pyroptosis, the release of proinflammatory cytokines as well as mitochondrial
  DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) and ultimately cause multiple organ
  dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Jia et al. []also demonstrate that many of the predictive
  metabolites altered due to SARS-CoV-2 strongly correlate with proinflammatory cytokines.
