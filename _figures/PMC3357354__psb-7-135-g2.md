caption: Figure 2. Model of IDA signaling. A mature posttranslational modified IDA
  peptide consisting of the EPIP, or part of the EPIP, domain may bind the extracellular
  LRRs of a HAE homodimer, a HSL2 homodimer, or a HAE-HSL2 heterodimer and cause autophosphorylation
  (P) of the kinase receptor domains. The signal from IDA-HAE/HSL2 is suggested to
  be transduced via a phosphorelay involving MKK4, MKK5, MPK3 and MPK6. Genetic evidence
  suggests that BP/KNAT1 acts as a negative downstream component of this signaling
  pathway by inhibiting cell separation and the expression of KNAT2 and KNAT6. Upon
  activation of the IDA signaling pathway, the BP/KNAT1 restriction of KNAT2 and KNAT6
  is elevated, and these transcription factors can act as positive regulators of floral
  organ separation by positively regulating genes promoting AZ cell separation. In
  addition, BP/KNAT1 is a positive regulator of EVR, which influences cell separation
  by a separate parallel pathway.
