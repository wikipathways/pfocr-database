caption: 'TNFα/TNFR1 molecular signaling is explained in more detail. Other signals
  such as FASL/FAS, TRAIL/TRAIL, PAMPS, or LPS/TLR2/4 can also trigger necroptosis.
  TNFα is released during inflammatory conditions. (a) TNFα binds to TNFR1, inducing
  recruitment of TRADD, RIPK1, TRAF 2, TRAF5, cIAP 1/2, and other molecules to form
  Complex I. (b) Upon polyubiquitinated RIPK1 in Complex I, the TNFα/TNFR1 signaling
  can activate IKKs, which triggers the NF-kB signaling pathway cascade that leads
  to gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation. (c) deubiquitination
  and activation of RIPK1 by CYLD lead to the formation of Complex II. (d) TRADD and
  RIPK1 become modified and dissociate from TNFR1. The liberated death domain(DD)
  of TRADD (and/or RIPK1) binds to FADD, resulting in RIPK cleavage, caspase-8 recruitment
  (forming Complex IIa), activation of Caspase 8, which results in Caspase 3 activation
  and apoptosis. e) Inactivation of Caspase-8 in Complex II leads to the phosphorylation
  and activation of RIPK1, RIPK3, and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of
  MLKL during the necrosome assembly (Complex IIb), oligomerization of MLKL monomer
  leads to induction of necroptosis.Abbreviations: TNF: tumor necrosis factor; TNFR1:
