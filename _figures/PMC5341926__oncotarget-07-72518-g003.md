caption: The network was obtained from proteins showing significant (t-test) variations
  between IL-27 treatment and control. The network was built through the merge between
  a first network obtained according to ClueGO setup and a second one built by GENEMANIA
  app. Each big node represents a Gene Ontology Biological Process term or a Reactome
  pathway, while the small node represents query proteins used for the analysis from
  which previous terms are obtained. The node size represents the P value obtained
  from two-side hypergeometric test corrected by the Bonferroni step-down method.
  The protein expression is represented by the color scheme in which red and blue
  indicate high and low expression of proteins. The same colors are used for the node
  terms in which the pie represents the percentage of protein up or down regulated.
