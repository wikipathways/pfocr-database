caption: A hypothetical model for the role of phytohormone cross talk in the variation
  of the defences to plant pathogens under elevated CO2 concentrations. Elevated [CO2]
  up-regulated SA synthesis and signalling, including the PR1 and NPR1 genes, but
  it did not up-regulate components of the JA pathway. Thus, the altered SA/JA cross
  talk favoured the SA pathway-dependent defence but repressed the JA pathway-dependent
  defence, leading to reductions in plant disease caused by tobacco mosaic virus and
  Pseudomonas syringae, but increases in Botrytis cinerea incidence and severity under
  elevated [CO2] in tomato plants.
