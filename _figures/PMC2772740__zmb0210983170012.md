caption: Schematic representation of pathways involved in NOR-1 upregulation by thrombin
  and VEGF (light lines) and hypoxia (bold lines) in endothelial cells. Thrombin and
  VEGF induce NOR-1 expression through a mechanism dependent on PAR-1 (protease-activated
  receptor-1) and VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2/KDR), respectively, and multiple signaling
  pathways including cytosolic Ca2+, the activation of PKC, and MAPK pathways (both
  ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) that lead to the downstream activation of CREB. VEGFR-2 can
  also activate Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates
  calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (Ca/CM). The potential cross talk among signaling
  pathways is indicated by dashed arrows. p90RSK, p38 MAPK, and Ca/CM are kinases
  potentially involved in CREB phosphorylation in Ser-133 (). The indicated cross
  talk mechanisms and kinases potentially involved in CREB phosphorylation have not
  been specifically analyzed in relation with NOR upregulation. Hypoxia increases
  intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and its downstream
  target mTOR. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could mediate the upregulation of HIF-1α
  protein levels by decreasing HIF-1α degradation and/or increasing HIF-1α synthesis
  (, ). Agents that inhibit NOR-1 expression interfering signaling pathways are indicated
  (boxed). Arrows and T-bars indicate activation and inhibition, respectively. ATAP-2,

  description: Schematic representation of pathways involved in NOR-1 upregulation
    by thrombin and VEGF (light lines) and hypoxia (bold lines) in endothelial cells.
    Thrombin and VEGF induce NOR-1 expression through a mechanism dependent on PAR-1

    and multiple signaling pathways including cytosolic Ca2+, the activation of PKC,
    and MAPK pathways (both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK) that lead to the downstream activation
    of CREB. VEGFR-2 can also activate Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. An increase in intracellular
    Ca2+ activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (Ca/CM). The potential cross
    talk among signaling pathways is indicated by dashed arrows. p90RSK, p38 MAPK,
    and Ca/CM are kinases potentially involved in CREB phosphorylation in Ser-133
    (). The indicated cross talk mechanisms and kinases potentially involved in CREB
    phosphorylation have not been specifically analyzed in relation with NOR upregulation.
    Hypoxia increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration, which activates the PI3K/Akt
    pathway and its downstream target mTOR. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway could mediate
