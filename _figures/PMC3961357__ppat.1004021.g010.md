caption: The de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway is utilized to generate ATP during
  vaccinia virus infection. ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA;
  FASN (fatty acid synthease) catalyzes successive condensation reactions of malonyl
  CoA with acetyl-CoA to generate the 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate. Palmitate is
  then imported into the mitochondria by CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyl transferase) 1.
  Within the mitochondria, palmitate undergoes β-oxidation to generate acetyl-CoA
  which drives the TCA cycle (and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation) to generate
  ATP. Glutaminolysis enables glutamine to anaplerotically fill in the TCA cycle.
  Glutamine is converted to glutamate by Glnase (glutaminase) which is further converted
  to α-ketoglutarate by GDH (glutamate dehydrogenase). Inhibitors of this pathway
  are shown in red; impairment of each of the steps in this pathway significantly
  diminishes vaccinia virus production. ATP production supports DNA replication and
  protein synthesis (gray dashed lines), but is most important for the assembly of
  nascent virions (black dashed line).
