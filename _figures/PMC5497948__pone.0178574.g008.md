caption: In smooth muscle, activation of RhoA by contractile agonist causes stimulation
  of Rho kinase activity and Rho kinase-dependent phosphorylation of MYPT1 resulting
  in inhibition of MLCP activity and increase in MLC20 phosphorylation and muscle
  contraction. In diabetic smooth muscle, oxidative stress causes upregulation of
  RhoA/Rho kinase pathway and hypercontraction. The decrease in miR-133a expression
  in response to oxidative stress leads to an increase in RhoA expression, Rho kinase
  activity, MYPT1 phosphorylation and muscle contraction.
