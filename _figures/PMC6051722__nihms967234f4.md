caption: Chylomicrons secreted from the intestine and very low density lipoprotein
  (VLDL) secreted from the liver are lipolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leading
  to triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TGRL) remnants. Chylomicron secretion is largely
  regulated by food intake, whereas VLDL secretion is controlled by insulin. Remnant
  particles undergo remodeling via the enzymatic action of cholesteryl ester transfer
  protein (CETP) with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), hepatic lipase (HL), and the
  exchange of soluble apolipoproteins such as E, C-I, C-II, and C-III. TGRL remnants
  are cleared from the circulation via receptor-mediated uptake involving the low-density
  lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), LDL receptor–like protein (LRP), and heparan
  sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). Chylomicron remnants and VLDL remnants compete for
  the same lipolytic pathway, a process mediated by apoE. While chylomicron remnant
  clearance may be mediated by LDLR-, LRP-, or HSPG, VLDL remnants are believed to
  be predominantly cleared via LDLR. Individuals with apoE2 isoforms have reduced
  remnant clearance and are postulated to have compensatory upregulation of cellular
  LDLR expression that may lead to decreased LDL-TG and LDL-C levels. The purported
  role of HL in the lipolytic conversion of IDL to LDL may at least partly explain
  why individuals with decreased HL activity due to genetic variation in the LIPC
  gene (e.g., rs 2070895) have elevated LDL-TG levels.
