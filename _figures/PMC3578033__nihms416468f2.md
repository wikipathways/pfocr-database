caption: A. Relative levels of some of the prostanoids produced by classically activated
  mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages differentiated in the presence of a normal
  (5.5 mM) glucose concentration and then stimulated with LPS and IFNγ for 48 h. B.
  When bone marrow-derived macrophages are differentiated in high concentration of
  glucose, such as that observed in diabetic mice (25 mM), the total amount of the
  prostanoids increases, as well as the relative levels of PGD2 and PGE2. C. A proposed
  role for ACSL1 in arachidonic acid handling in an inflammatory macrophage is shown.
  Arachidonic acid (C20:4) is taken up by macrophages through diffusion across the
  plasma membrane or by FA transport proteins. C20:4 is rapidly converted to arachidonoyl-CoA
  (20:4-CoA) by ACSL1 and perhaps other enzymes with acyl-CoA synthetase activity.
  This reaction traps C20:4 within the cell because of the bulky hydrophilic CoA moiety,
  and also allows it to be incorporated into phospholipids, such as phosphatidylinolsitol
  (PI), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), through reacylation
  or through de novo synthesis. Activation of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) liberates C20:4
  from phospholipids and makes it available for eicosanoid production. In macrophages
  subjected to an inflammatory environment, such as diabetes or following TLR4 activation,
  production of eicosanoids is skewed toward a pathway mediated by cyclooxygenase
  2 (COX-2). The COX-2 pathway results in enhanced production of prostaglandin PGE2,
  PGD2 and PGF2α, after TLR4 stimulation or in the setting of diabetes. These prostaglandins
  in turn act on other cells, or bind to specific receptors on the macrophage, resulting
  in activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways. Downstream signaling
  from these receptors is in turn governed by a number of modulators, such as A-kinase
  anchor proteins (AKAPs). Thus, induction of ACSL1 in inflammatory macrophages has
  the potential to enhance and fine-tune a complex network of potent modulators of
  the inflammatory response. Red font, mediators shown to be increased by diabetes;
  orange font, mediators shown to be increased by inflammatory stimuli, e.g. TLR4
  activation.
