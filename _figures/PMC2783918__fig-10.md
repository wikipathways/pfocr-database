caption: Redox control of the cell cycle and cardiovascular diseases. Receptor-mediated
  ROS signaling can activate cellular proliferation during atherosclerosis. ROS generated
  from PDGF–ligand interaction can convert PTEN from the reduced form (phosphatase
  active) to the disulfide form (phosphatase inactive). Inactive PTEN can favor AKT
  phosphorylation, which in turn can phosphorylate GSK-3β, thereby stabilizing cyclin
  D1 and facilitating proliferation. ROS signaling can also initiate the ERK pathway,
  activating growth-promoting transcription factors, c-fos and c-myc. c-fos and c-myc
  can transcriptionally activate cyclin D1 and cyclin A expression, supporting proliferation.
  Nitric oxide inhibits proliferation by suppressing cyclin A expression and increasing
  p21 protein levels.
