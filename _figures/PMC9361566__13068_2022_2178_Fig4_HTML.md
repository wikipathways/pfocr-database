caption: 'In vitro framework converting C1 feedstocks to isobutyraldehyde and other
  chemicals. A Design of the cell-free system converting CO2 to isobutyraldehyde.
  The proposed in vitro pathway for isobutyraldehyde production was assembled using
  two parts. The first one converting CO2 to D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) was
  generated based on the first two modules of ASAP [] and was indicated in grey color.
  The second one converting 3-phosphoglycerate to isobutyraldehyde was indicated in
  pink color. Metabolite: Dihydroxyacetone (DHA); Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP);
  Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP); 1,3-Biphosphoglycerate (1,3PG); 3-Phosphoglycerate
  (3PG); 2-Phosphoglycerate (2PG); Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP); 2-acetolactate (2-AL);
  2,3-Dihydroxy-isovalerate (DHKIV); 2-Ketoisovalerate (KIV); Isobutyraldehyde (IBAL).
  Enzymes: alcohol oxidase (aox); formolase (fls); dihydroxyacetone kinase (dak);
  triosephosphate isomerase (tpi). B Cell-free framework for producing a wide array
  of chemicals. Similar to the in vitro system of isobutyraldehyde, cell lysates with
  pathway-specific enzymes or the designed cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) system
  can be employed for production of various chemicals by assembling with the first
  two modules of ASAP'
