caption: The reactions catalyzed by corresponding genes. The reaction directions shown
  in accordance with the physiological direction of the reaction. A GdhA catalyzes
  the ATP-independent amination of α-ketoglutarate to yield L-glutamate. B YbdK catalyzes
  the ATP-dependent ligation of glutamate with cysteine. C GadB catalyzes the cleavage
  of L-glutamate into carbon dioxide and 4-aminobutanoate
