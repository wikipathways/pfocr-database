caption: Rickettsia species must import host isoprenes and terpenoids for the synthesis
  of ubiquinone and the lipid carrier of lipid I and O-antigen. (A) In the absence
  of a mevalonate or MEP/DOXP pathway for terpenoid synthesis, Rickettsia species
  must import IPP from the host. If Idi is present, as it is in some species, DMAPP
  can be synthesized to provide dimethylallyl phosphate for the ubiquinone (CoQ8)
  pathway. Otherwise, DMAPP must also be imported from the host. Dashed orange lines
  indicate that no enzymes are present to use IPP and DMAPP for GPP generation, and
  thus, FPP must also be acquired from the host. Gray circles depict holes in the
  pathways for the generation of both GPP and FPP. Host-acquired IPP and FPP can then
  be used by undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (IspU) and octaprenyl-diphosphate synthase
  (IspB) to generate terpenoid backbones UPP and ODP, respectively. Via phosphatidylglycerophosphatase
  B (PgpB), UPP is then converted to di-trans,poly-cis-undecaprenyl phosphate, the
  lipid carrier for lipid I (green) and O-antigen (light blue). OPP and PHBA are used
  by PHBA polyprenyltransferase (UbiA) to initiate CoQ8synthesis (brown). The lack
  of enzymes to either synthesize chorismate or convert it to PHBA indicates that
  rickettsiae must import host PHBA, which is an essential host metabolite provided
  by diet and/or the microbiome. The gray circle indicates a hole (UbiC) in the CoQ8synthesis
  pathway. Note that all rickettsial genomes encode UbiB, a putative kinase with an
  unknown role in CoQ8 biosynthesis (). (B) Genes involved in terpenoid backbone and
  CoQ8 biosynthesis are largely conserved. The complete distributions of these genes
  in 84 Rickettsia genomes (see ) indicate that the most basal lineage of spotted
  fever group rickettsiae (R. tamurae, R. monacensis, REIP, and R. buchneri strains)
  lacks idi and thus must also acquire DMAPP from the host.
