caption: Proposed metabolic pathway depicting the importance of Mt-PrsA for the generation
  of pRpp in M. tuberculosis. R5P is generated via the catabolism of glucose through
  the pentose phosphate pathway, a process ubiquitous throughout nature. Like all
  pRpp synthetase enzymes, Mt-PrsA catalyses the transfer of pyrophosphate from ATP
  to the C1–OH group of R5P forming pRpp and AMP. In a process unique to members belonging
  to the Corynebacteriaceae, such as M. tuberculosis, pRpp is utilized as the sole
  metabolic intermediate in the formation of DPA, which is a crucial substrate required
  for mycobacterial cell wall assembly. DP, decaprenol-1-monophosphate; DPA, decaprenol-1-monophosphoarabinose;
  DPR, decaprenol-1-monophosphoribose; DPPR, decaprenol-1-monophosphoribose-5-phosphate;
  DPX, decaprenol-1-monophosphoryl-2-keto-β-erythro-pentofuranose; pRpp, phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate;
  R5P, ribose -5-phosphate.
