caption: a Lon protease performs dual activities including functioning as a chaperone
  to refold misfolded proteins and as a protease to degrade misfolded proteins. b
  Inactivation of Lon protease results in the accumulation of misfolded proteins,
  thereby activating the unfolded protein stress response pathway and inhibiting mitochondrial
  translation. The mechanism of translation inhibition is unknown
papertitle: Inactivation of Lon protease reveals a link between mitochondrial unfolded
  protein stress and mitochondrial translation inhibition.
