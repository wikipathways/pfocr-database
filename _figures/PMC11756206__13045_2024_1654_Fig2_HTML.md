caption: The development of gastric cancer is induced by H. pylori. Key aspects of
  bacterial pathopoiesis involve flagellar motility, mechanisms of adhesion, disruption
  of intercellular junctions, and damage to the gastric epithelium via vacuolization.
  The H. pylori virulence factors activate STAT3, NF-κB, ERK, Akt, and Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathways, and exert key roles in abnormal motogenic signal, hummingbird
  phenotype, motility and proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and disruption
  of cell polarity, leading to gastric carcinogenesis
