caption: Model of the mechanism of vGPCR-mediated ARE-mRNA stabilization. In this
  working model, vGPCR stimulates two signal transduction pathways that negatively
  impact ARE-mRNA decay. vGPCR has been reported to promote the phosphorylation and
  polyubiquitination of TAK1 (), which initiates a signal transduction pathway involving
  activation of MKK3 and/or MKK6 (), p38 MAPK, and the p38 substrate MK2. MK2 phosphorylates
  destabilizing ARE-binding proteins like tristetraprolin (TTP), generating binding
  sites for cytoplasmic 14-3-3 scaffolding proteins that disrupt recruitment of a
  complex of endo- and exonucleases known as the exosome (, ). In addition, MK2 phosphorylates
  the heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), which has been shown to form a complex with p115GEF
  to activate RhoA (). In response to a variety of stresses, including viral infection,
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) is phosphorylated, which prevents
  initiation by limiting the availability of eIF2-GTP-tRNAmet. Specific RNA binding
  proteins bind to these stalled translation preinitiation complexes and nucleate
  the formation of large cytoplasmic mRNP aggregates known as stress granules (SGs),
  in which translationally inactive transcripts are triaged and routed to sites of
  reinitiation or degradation (). TTP has been reported to transport bound ARE-mRNAs
  to processing bodies (PBs), sites of translational repression, and mRNA degradation
  (). vGPCR activates RhoA (, ), and recent work has shown that RhoA activation disrupts
  the stress-induced rearrangement of PBs and stabilizes ARE-mRNAs (). We provide
  evidence that vGPCR impacts both MK2 activity and PB dynamics, thereby potently
  stabilizing ARE-mRNAs and increasing the production of proteins encoded by ARE-mRNAs
  (e.g., Cox-2, IL-6). These studies provide the first evidence for vGPCR-mediated
  reprogramming of host gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, which may
  facilitate secretion of angiogenic growth factors from lytically infected cells.
