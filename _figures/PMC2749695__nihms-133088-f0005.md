caption: Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) recruits PI3K directly or
  indirectly via RAS to the plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates phosphosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to generate the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 recruits
  AKT and PDK1 to the plasma membrane, and activates AKT. AKT phosphorylates a variety
  of downstream substrates and regulates the cell cycle, cell growth and metabolism,
  and cell death. PTEN antagonizes the PI3K-AKT pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3.
  BMP activation of receptor BMPR1A in epithelial cells prevents inhibition of PTEN
  through phosphorylation and facilitates PTEN function. AKT activates mTORC1 through
  phosphorylation of TSC2, and inactivates the GTPase activity of TSC2 for Rheb. Rheb-GTP
  activates mTORC1 and downstream S6 kinases. Phosphorylation of FOXO by AKT inhibits
  its regulation of cell metabolism. Phosphorylation of Chk1 results its nuclear exclusion
  and sequestration from key downstream targets, including the DNA damage-sensing
  kinases ATM and ATR. Phosphorylation of MDM2 by AKT activates p53 degradation. In
  the presence of WNT, Frizzled (FZD) interacts with Dishevelled (DVL) and inactivates
  the APC-destruction complex leading to the stabilization of β-catenin and its nuclear
  translocation. Phosphorylation of β-catenin or GSK3 mimics the effect of WNT signaling
  activation that stabilizes and mediates β-catenin nuclear translocation, which accelerates
  the cell cycle and potentiates tumorigenesis, in part through CyclinD1 and Myc transcription.
  GCC signaling suppresses AKT activation through a multiple mechanisms, in part by
  increasing PTEN expression and function. Proteins activated during tumorigenesis
  are shown in red, and those inactivated are in blue. Proteins activated by phosphorylation
  are indicated by a red phosphate, while those inactivated by phosphorylation are
  indicated by a blue phosphate. Cellular processes regulated by AKT downstream substrates
  are illustrated by underline colores.
