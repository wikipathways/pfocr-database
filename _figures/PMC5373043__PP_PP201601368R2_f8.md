caption: Model of the regulatory pathways of root greening after shoot removal. Chloroplast
  development in roots is positively regulated by cytokinin signaling via the His
  kinases AHK2 and AHK3 and negatively regulated by auxin signaling via INDOLE-3-ACETIC
  ACID INDUCIBLE14 (IAA14) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs). In intact roots, auxin
  transported from the shoot represses chloroplast development, but in detached roots,
  the negative auxin regulation is attenuated, and the wound-responsive transcription
  factor WIND1 is induced in response to shoot removal and activates the type B ARR-mediated
  cytokinin signaling pathway. Several transcription factors associated with chloroplast
  development (HY5, GNC, GNL, and GLK2) function downstream of auxin/cytokinin signaling
  to directly and indirectly up-regulate nucleus- and plastid-encoded genes associated
  with chloroplast development. Type B ARRs also directly regulate some photosynthesis-associated
  nuclear genes and induce  accumulation and photosynthetic activation in roots. Arrows
  and bars represent positive and negative regulation, respectively.

  description: Model of the regulatory pathways of root greening after shoot removal.
    Chloroplast development in roots is positively regulated by cytokinin signaling
    via the His kinases AHK2 and AHK3 and negatively regulated by auxin signaling
    via INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE14 (IAA14) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORs (ARFs).
    In intact roots, auxin transported from the shoot represses chloroplast development,
    but in detached roots, the negative auxin regulation is attenuated, and the wound-responsive
    transcription factor WIND1 is induced in response to shoot removal and activates
    the type B ARR-mediated cytokinin signaling pathway. Several transcription factors
    associated with chloroplast development (HY5, GNC, GNL, and GLK2) function downstream
    of auxin/cytokinin signaling to directly and indirectly up-regulate nucleus- and
    plastid-encoded genes associated with chloroplast development. Type B ARRs also
    directly regulate some photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes and induce  accumulation
    and photosynthetic activation in roots. Arrows and bars represent positive and
    negative regulation, respectively.
