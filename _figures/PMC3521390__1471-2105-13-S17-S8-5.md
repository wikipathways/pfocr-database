caption: Novel pathway finding for plant biochemical pathways. "Gentiodelphin" is
  a plant-derived secondary metabolite associated with blue dye, and is known to be
  synthesized from "Delphinidin". The biochemical pathway was predicted with a start
  node of Delphinidin and a goal node of Gentiodelphin. The LP heuristic predicted
  the two shortest path solutions shown in this figure. The arrow indicates the reaction
  rule for routing information, accompanied by the KEGG reaction number. Both predicted
  pathways consist of four enzyme reactions. The first path (blue) is a metabolic
  pathway present in the KEGG pathway database. On the other hand, the second path
  (orange) is new and not registered in the KEGG database, and there is a possibility
  of a new route where the operator "R6798" is applied at the end.
