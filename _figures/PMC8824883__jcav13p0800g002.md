caption: Cdc42 mediates the occurrence of multiple malignant tumors through different
  pathways. Cdc42 binding to EGFR receptor activates MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, leading
  to the development of breast cancer. It also activates downstream effector molecules
  PAK and IQGAP, which are related with breast cancer occurrence. Cdc42 activates
  the WNT signaling pathway and AKT, and then inhibits GSK3, mTORC, and ERK1/2, leading
  to the development of gastric cancer. Cdc42 activates Tweak/Fn14 complex and leads
  to glioma formation. Cdc42 also inhibits the formation of adhesive junction complexes
  (AJC) giving rise to the development of colorectal cancer.
