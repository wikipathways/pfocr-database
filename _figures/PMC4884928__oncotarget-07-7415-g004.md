caption: A. The principle of CAP-Net analysis. The shortest paths were calculated
  between the drug targets and the differentially expressed genes (DEG). The common
  pathways were found by the pathway overlap among the target-DEG pairs and the different
  drugs. B. CAP-Net showed the commonly affected downstream pathways during MCF7 differentiation
  (Day 5). Diamonds and circles, respectively, represent the targets and the differentially
  expressed genes. The color of a node represents the average expression level of
  the corresponding gene.
