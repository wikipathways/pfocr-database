caption: Priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the canonical pathway. The canonical
  pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome activation requires a priming step. This occurs when
  a DAMP or PAMP (such as LPS) binds to a non-NLR receptor (such as TLR) or there
  is signaling though IL-1R or tumor necrosis factor receptor. The effect of this
  binding leads to further signaling through either NF-κB and/or BRCC36. Signaling
  through NF-κB leads to production of de novo pro-IL-1β and other components of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome while signaling through BRCC36 leads to deubiquination of existing
  NLRP3. Deubiquination then frees NLRP3 to be activated, i.e. “licenses” it for activation.
