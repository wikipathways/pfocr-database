caption: Schematic illustration of neuroprotection targeted to oxidative stress and
  induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in ischemic stroke. (A) NMDAR
  and AMPAR inhibitors targeted to reduce calcium overload. (B) ROS scavenger antioxidant
  and Nrf2 inducer in regulating the Nrf2 pathway under oxidative stress conditions.
  Disruption of the Nrf2-Keap1 association is mediated by free radicals, or inducers
  of Nrf2, and leads to a diminished rate of proteolysis, thereby enhancing the nuclear
  accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus. Nrf2 binds with AREs in the promoter region
  of its target genes and induces nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins and GPX4,
  resulting in an adaptive response. (C) Mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained through
  balanced biogenesis of new mitochondria, mitochondrial fission, and fusion. The
  mitochondrial shape is fundamental to mitochondrial (metabolic) activity. The efficiency
  of ATP production is increased, and the exchange of matrix content is favored in
  fused organelles. In contrast, fragmented organelles produce more reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and are efficiently cleared by mitophagy. Mitochondrial fission is
  a hallmark of the early steps of apoptosis. D. The indicated pathways regulating
  ferroptosis sensitivity.
