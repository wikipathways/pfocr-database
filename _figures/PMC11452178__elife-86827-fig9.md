caption: The MSTNDel73C mutation with FGF5 knockout mediated the activation of FOSL1
  via MEK-ERK-FOSL1 axis. The activated FOSL1 promotes skeletal muscle satellite cell
  proliferation and inhibits myogenic differentiation by inhibiting the expression
  of MyoD1, and resulting in fusion to form smaller myotubes. In addition, activated
  ERK1/2 may inhibit the secondary fusion of myotubes by Ca2+-dependent CaMKII activation
  pathway, leading to myoblasts fusion to form smaller myotubes
