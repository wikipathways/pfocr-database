caption: The 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) by inserting molecular oxygen into carbon 5 catalyzes
  the conversion of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroxyperoxy-eicosatetrenoic acid (5-HPETE),
  which can subsequently be metabolized to 5-hydroxyeicosatetrenoic acid (5-HETE)
  as well as different leukotrienes such as leukotrienes A4 and leurkotriene B4.
