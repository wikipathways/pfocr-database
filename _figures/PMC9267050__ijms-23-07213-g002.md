caption: Reactivation of p53 protein family for improved therapy in EGFR-mutated (EGFRmut)
  lung cancer. Targeted drugs or repurposed drugs that reactivate p53 proteins in
  EGFR-mutated malignancies are promising candidates for improved cancer therapy.
  APR-246 (eprenetapopt) refolds mutant p53 to wild-type conformation and might induce
  lysosome-mediate degradation of mutant EGFR protein (EGFRmut). At the same time,
  repurposed protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and metformin (MET) might promote reactivation
  of wild-type p53 and p73 by inhibiting their interactions with MDM2 and MDMX or
  activating acetylation of p53 and p73 respectively. The reactivation of both tumor
  suppressor proteins might enhance apoptosis induction in the presence of EGFRmut.
  In addition, it might be foreseen that metformin-mediated inhibition of EGFR-PI3K—AKT
  pathway will further enhance the response of EGFR-mutated cancer cells to the treatment.
