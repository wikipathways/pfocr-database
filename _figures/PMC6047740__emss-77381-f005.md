caption: (Upper) Interhase cells. Centrosomes are connected by a linker that consists
  of fibrous Rootletin and is anchored to the proximal sides of centrioles by C-NAP1.
  During interphase, centrosome cohesion is maintained by action of Axin2/Conductin
  and GSK-3β by phosphorylation of β-catenin. DVL in ciliated cells promote basal
  body docking, via interaction with CEP164 and other proteins. Axin and APC can be
  also found at centrosome, probably due to their microtubule interactions. NEK2 is
  kept inactive in complex with PLK1/MST2/PP1γ. (Lower) G2/M phase. Phosphorylation
  cascade activates NEK2, which subsequently acts on several targets. β-catenin is
  protected from degradation by NEK2 phosphorylation, and promotes centrosome separation;
  Axin2/Conductin is degraded by proteasome. Concurrently, phosphorylation of DVL
  and C-NAP1 by NEK2 leads to the increase in their overall negative charge and subsequent
  release from centrioles. Centrosomes can be subsequently pulled apart. Axin is phosphorylated
  by PLK1, which affects microtubule dynamics during spindle formation. For details
  and references see text.
