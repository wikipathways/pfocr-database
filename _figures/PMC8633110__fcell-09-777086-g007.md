caption: Simplified model of the molecular mechanisms underlying sperm incubation
  in the presence and absence of exogenous nutrients. 1) In NUTR condition, glucose
  is transported into sperm through GLUT and other active transporters, and enters
  the glycolytic pathway, producing ATP. The final product of glycolysis is pyruvate,
  which can be converted to lactate by LDH. 2) Exogenous pyruvate and lactate can
  also enter sperm plasma membrane by MCT and be transported to the mitochondria for
  further metabolization by the Krebs cycle and OXPHOS, which also generate ATP. 3)
  Influx of HCO3− stimulates Adcy10 with the production of cAMP and activation of
  PKA, which in turn, provokes the phosphorylation of substrates. 4) Under this condition,
  Ca2+ enters sperm mainly through CatSper channels and [Ca2+]i levels are regulated
  by ATP-driven pumps (PMCA4 and SERCA). As a result, sperm can maintain motility
  and develop hyperactivation. 5) In the absence of exogenous substrates, ATP would
  be produced by fatty acid oxidation and/or by amino acid metabolism. Such ATP allows
  the production of sufficient levels of cAMP to stimulate pPKAs. 6) Decreased ATP
  concentrations inhibit the normal operation of Ca2+ pumps and transporters, increasing
  the [Ca2+]i. All these events allow the development of motility but not hyperactivation.
  7) In STRV, the addition of CCCP, ROT and AA blocks OXPHOS, resulting in motility
  loss. To simplify this model, transporters and some enzymes are named by generic
  terms. Filled arrows indicate activation; dotted arrows show hypothetic pathways.
