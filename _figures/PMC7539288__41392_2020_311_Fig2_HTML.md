caption: 'Subcellular equilibrium of NAD+. The NAD+ homeostasis is maintained by the
  biosynthesis, consumption and recycling in differentiate subcellular compartments
  including the cytosol, the nucleus and the mitochondria. NAD+ precursors including
  Trp, NA, NR, NMN and NAM are metabolized into NAD+ via Preiss-Handler pathway, de
  novo pathway and salvage pathway, respectively. NAD+ can receive hydride to yield
  the reduced form NADH in the metabolic processes including glycolysis, FAO, and
  the TCA cycle. NADH provides an electron pair to drive the mitochondrial OXPHOS
  for the generation of ATP and the conversion of lactic acid to pyruvate. The cytosolic
  and mitochondrial NADH is exchanged through the malate-aspartate shuttle and glycerol-3-phosphate
  shuttle, while the cytosolic and mitochondrial NADPH is exchanged by the isocitrate-a-KG
  shuttle. NAD+ can also be phosphorylated into NADP+ by NAD+ kinases including nicotinamide
  nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) and NAD kinases (NADKs). Cytosolic NADP+ is reduced
  into NADPH by G6PD and 6PGD in the pentose phosphate pathway, and by ME1 in the
  conversion of malate to pyruvate. Mitochondrial NADPH is produced by IDH2, GLUD,
  NNT and ME3. The NADPH is required for the activation of NOXs and the synthesis
  of palmitate. Abbreviation: α-KGDH, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; GLUD, glutamate
  dehydrogenase; NNT, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde
