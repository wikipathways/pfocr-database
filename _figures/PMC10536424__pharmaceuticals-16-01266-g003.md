caption: Anti-cancer mechanisms of PDE5 inhibitors. Via activation of the cGMP/PKG
  signaling cascade, PDE5-Is can induce apoptosis in cancer cells via various pathways;
  activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) via phosphorylation of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MEKK1), phosphorylation of β-catenin and inducing
  its proteosomal degradation which leads to decreased expression of Wnt/β-catenin
  regulated proteins, such as cyclin D1 and survivin in addition to blocking the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling
  pathways. PDE5-Is could also increase intracellular levels of other chemotherapeutic
  agents via inhibition of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-mediated drug
  efflux, averting multidrug resistance (MDR) in addition to increasing cellular drug
  uptake via enhancing endocytosis. Moreover, PDE5-Is synergize with other chemotherapeutic
  agents via boosting various apoptotic, autophagy, mitotic arrest and chaperone degradation
  pathways. PDE5-Is can also abrogate the function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells
  (MDSCs) via suppression of arginase-1 (Arg-1) and nitric oxide synthase–2 (NOS-2)
  production. This results in enhanced intratumoral T-cell infiltration and activation
  and restores both systemic and tumor-specific immunity. P = phosphorylation.
