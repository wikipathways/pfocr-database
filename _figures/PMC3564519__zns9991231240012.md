caption: Simplified scheme summarizing the effect of aging and MPTP on Nrf2-ARE axis
  dysfunction-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling dysregulation in NPCs associated with
  neurogenic impairment. In young mice, a regulatory circuit linking microglial activation
  and proinflammatory cytokine to Nrf2-ARE protective pathway in SVZ, provides an
  efficient self-adaptive mechanism against inflammatory/neurotoxin-induced oxidative
  stress. In addition to governing the redox balance within the SVZ niche, the Nrf2-induced
  Hmox target gene may simultaneously protect astrocytes, thereby upregulating the
  expression of vital Wnt signaling elements that switch on key components required
  for maintaining SVZ cells in a proliferative state, for promoting differentiation,
  and/or for exerting neuroprotective effects. Cross talk between two pivotal pathways,
  the PI3-K/Akt/GSK-3β and Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascades, appears to finely control
  the transcriptional activator, β-catenin, which in turn represents a point of convergence
  to direct proliferation/differentiation/survival in the SVZ stem niche. Importantly,
  SVZ “rejuvenation” may have beneficial consequences for DAergic neuroprotection,
  and vice versa. Astrocytes (blue), neuroblasts (red), transit-amplifying cells (yellow),
  and ependymal cells (purple) in SVZ niche are schematically illustrated.
