caption: 'Working model of Anthocyanin and Proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway adapted
  from []. Enzymes are represented in uppercase bold letters; the products in the
  pathway are given in black boxes. The enzymes involved in the pathway are shown
  as follows: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone-3β-hydroxylase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; and UFGT,
  UDP-Glc:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase'
