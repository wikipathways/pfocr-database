caption: Simplified scheme of monolignol synthesis pathway in conifers. Thick arrows
  highlight the route channeling the higher amount of carbon in conifers, the synthesis
  of coniferyl alcohol. The gray and discontinued arrows highlight the sinapyl alcohol
  synthesis that does occur in conifers because of the lack a gene encoding the F5H
  enzyme. Asterisk highlights the lack of F5H enzyme in conifers. Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
  (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate:CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase (CCR), cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
  (HCT), p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase (C3H), caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT),
  ferulic acid 5-hydroxylase/coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase (F5H), and caffeic acid
  3-O-methyltransferase (COMT).
