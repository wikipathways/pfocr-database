caption: The biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids and the heat map of changes in transcripts
  in flavonoid metabolism. Rectangles marked with red and yellow backgrounds represent
  increased abundances of transcripts in RB vs. CK and UVB vs. CK, respectively. The
  blue background represents reduced abundances of transcripts in RB vs. CK and UVB
  vs. CK
