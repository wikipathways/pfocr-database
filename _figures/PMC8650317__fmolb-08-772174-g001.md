caption: Deranged mitochondrial intermediate metabolism contributes to development
  of organ dysfunction in patients with acute decompensated liver cirrhosis. The different
  metabolic intermediate pathways located in mitochondria are depicted, and how their
  derangements contribute to the clinical symptoms of patients with acutely decompensated
  liver cirrhosis. The boxes inside the mitochondrion highlight the electron transport
  chain (ETC), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glutamine synthesis as one
  possible pathway for ammonia detoxification. Peripheral mononuclear cells of patients
  with ACLF exhibit a discontinuous TCA cycle at the isocitrate and succinate dehydrogenase
  (IDH and SDH) level (1). Succinate is transported into the cytosol where it inhibits
  prolyl hydroxylase (PHD), resulting in stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
  (HIF-1α) and enhanced production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Untargeted metabolomics
  in serum of patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF revealed increased degradation of
  tryptophan (Trp) through the kynurenine pathway with elevated kynurenine and kynurenic
  acid levels, which bind to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) localized in the intermembrane
  space of mitochondria (2). Activation of AhR is implicated in attenuation of mitochondrial
  maximal respiration. Patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF also exhibit elevated levels
  of fatty acids and acylcarnitines, pointing towards impaired β-oxidation (3). Saturated
  fatty acids (FA) change the composition of cardiolipins which are enriched in the
  inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating the release of cytochrome c. Targeted
  study of bioactive lipid mediators in patients with AD cirrhosis and ACLF revealed
  elevated levels of arachidonic acid and its products LTE4 and PGF2α(4). Arachidonic
  acid is able to modify the phospholipid composition of mitochondrial membranes,
  resulting in impaired function of the ETC. In addition to being involved in pro-inflammatory
  responses, succinate promotes fibrogenesis through its receptor GPR91 which is expressed
  on hepatic stellate cells (HSC), leading to upregulation of alpha-smooth muscle
  actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I (5). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released from hepatocytes
  promote inflammation through binding to toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) of liver resident
  Kupffer cells (KC) (6), further contributing to fibrogenesis. Reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) generated by the electron transport chain and released by mitochondria promote
  cell death of kidney cells, eventually leading to kidney dysfunction and failure
  (7). Hyperammonemia in patients with advanced liver cirrhosis leads to depletion
  of α-ketoglutarate in skeletal muscle and consequently lower TCA flux and ATP synthesis,
  translating into sarcopenia (8). Along with muscle loss, significant amounts of
  glutamine synthetase activity is lost, promoting hepatic encephalopathy (9). IDO,
  indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase. Figure was created with
