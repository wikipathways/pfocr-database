caption: Application of the algorithm to identify TNBC-associated genes. Genes and
  subnetworks of PPI associated with TNBC using TCGA breast cancer data and BioGRID
  PPI. Comparison of the selected genes from our proposed algorithm with those from
  lasso and elastic net (A). Genes and their respective subnetworks of PPI recovered
  by lasso (B) and our proposed Laplacian net algorithm (C). In the networks, genes
  having association to breast cancer reported in the literature are labeled with
  larger font.
