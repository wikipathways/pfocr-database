caption: Labeling pattern obtained from the metabolism of [2-13C]ALCAR via the pyruvate
  recycling pathway in brain. The initial labeling of OAA and malate from metabolism
  of [2-13C]ALCAR in the TCA cycle is show in the bottom left section of the figure.
  The [3-13C]malate, [2-13C]malate and [3-13C]oxaloacetate and [2-13C]oxaloacetate
  formed from metabolism of labeled ALCAR in the TCA cycle are converted to pyruvate
  via either malic enzyme or the combined action of pyruvate kinase and PEPCK, respectively.
  The labeled pyruvate formed can be converted to lactate and/or alanine labeled in
  the C1, C2 or C3 positions (‘partial’ recycling pathway). If ‘complete’ recycling
  occurs the labeled pyruvate formed is converted to acetyl CoA labeled in the C1
  position which condenses with citrate in the TCA cycle and gives rise to [5-13C]–α-ketoglutarate
  and subsequently GLU C5 and GLN C5. [1-13C]–α-ketoglutarate and GLU C1 and GLN C1
  is labeled from further metabolism of the [5-13C]–α-ketoglutarate formed from recycling
  via subsequent turns of the TCA cycle. Although, pyruvate recycling can give rise
  to acetyl CoA labeled in the C2 position, it is not possible to distinguish this
  from the [2-13C]acetyl CoA formed directly from [2-13C]ALCAR.
