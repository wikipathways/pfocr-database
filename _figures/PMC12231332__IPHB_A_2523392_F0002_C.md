caption: 'Effects of SB and its most widespread flavonoids on major mechanisms associated
  with diabetic bone (according to available in vitro and in vivo studies).The major
  mechanisms associated with diabetes and diabetic bone disease include AGEs formation,
  hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and inflammatory state. AGEs are formed as a
  result of the Maillard reaction, a process that is accelerated in hyperglycemic
  conditions. Additionally, AGEs can be produced through glucose autoxidation, the
  polyol pathway, and lipid peroxidation. AGEs trigger various signaling pathways,
  including MAPKs and NF-κB, as well as NADPH oxidase, leading to increased oxidative
  stress and inflammation. The accumulation of AGEs in bone is negatively correlated
  with the material and biomechanical properties of both cortical and trabecular bone.
  Higher levels of AGEs are also associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines
  and oxidative stress, resulting in inflammation and bone resorption. Furthermore,
  AGEs contribute to decreased bone formation and mineralization. Hyperglycemia and
  its associated hyperosmolarity have detrimental effects on osteoblast maturation,
  bone formation, and calcium uptake. Hyperglycemia-induced acidosis may also exacerbate
  bone resorption, ultimately increasing the risk of fractures. Insulin resistance
  can be caused by defects at the insulin receptor or post-receptor level, compromising
  signal transduction, or by an initial alteration in insulin signaling leading to
  insulin hypersecretion. Insulin signaling, originating from IRS, can be either metabolic
  or mitogenic. Metabolic signaling is mediated through PI3K and AKT, affecting various
  substrates such as mTOR, which regulates protein synthesis. Mitogenic signaling
  targets RAS, activating a cascade that leads to MAPKs, thereby mediating cell growth,
  division, migration, and apoptosis. Insulin resistance is associated with decreased
  bone strength and reduced bone turnover. In osteoblasts, insulin resistance lowers
  the levels of osteocalcin. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines lead to oxidative
  stress production and inhibit osteoblast differentiation. Additionally, these cytokines
  activate NF-κB signaling and promote osteoclast formation and function. SB and its
  flavonoids exert hypoglycemic and anti-inflammatory properties, attenuate insulin
  resistance, and inhibit AGEs formation. Blunt red arrows indicate an inhibitory
  effect, sharp green arrows designate a stimulatory effect. The red dashed arrow
  shows the effect based only on gene expression related to AGEs signaling and computational
  analysis. Black arrows indicate the connection of individual mechanisms. AGEs –
