caption: Model for the Coordinated Action of the Mating Types to Regulate Different
  Stages of Pathogenic Development of U. maydis.(A) Recognition of a compatible mating
  partner (Mfa) by the a-encoded pheromone/receptor (Pra) triggers signaling cascades
  that culminate in the activation of the high mobility group transcription factor
  Prf1 via differential phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A and the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase Kpp2 (not shown). Activated Prf1 in turn induces the expression of
  the a locus genes mfa and pra, the b locus genes bE and bW, as well as rbf1. Activation
  of the a pathway leads to formation of conjugation tubes and G2 cell cycle arrest.(B)
  After cell fusion, compatible bE/bW proteins dimerize and further induce the expression
  of rbf1. High levels of rbf1 ensure the maintenance of cell cycle arrest, induce
  filamentous growth, and facilitate the initial stages of plant infection.(C) After
  penetration of the host plant, Clp1 expression interferes with a- and b-dependent
  gene regulation via interaction with bW and Rbf1. The Clp1/Rbf1 interaction effectively
  represses the a-dependent pathway, whereas Clp1/bW interaction blocks b-dependent
  gene regulation. Since Clp1 is regulated by the bE/bW heterodimer, a negative autoregulatory
  feedback loop is established. The consequences of these regulatory cross-connections
  are (1) the downregulation of rbf1 after plant penetration and (2) the counteraction
  of the a- and b-induced cell cycle arrest. Further proliferation requires in addition
  the expression of the Cib1 protein, which is subject to developmentally regulated
  splicing.
