caption: 'Cocaine self-administration depletes dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens
  but results in a compensatory upregulation of the PKA–CREB–dynorphin signaling pathway.
  Importantly, mimicking these adaptations in rodent models results in an escalation
  of drug self-administration. The mesoaccumbens dopamine circuit comprises midbrain
  ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens in
  the basal forebrain. This system also receives afferent stimulation from the extended
  amygdala (central nucleus of the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis).
  Escalated drug intake is associated with increased CRF release in the extended amygdala,
  and CRF-receptor antagonism within the extended amygdala may suppress the activation
  of the mesoaccumbens system during drug self-administration. In addition, given
  the projection from the extended amygdala to hypothalamic nuclei that regulate emotionality,
  CRF antagonism may act to reduce the stress and anxiety associated with escalated
  drug intake. Dynorphin acts at presynaptic κ-opioid receptors located on ventral
  tegmental area projection neurons to inhibit dopamine release, and upregulation
  of dynorphin release following cocaine self-administration is a possible mechanism
  underlying decreased reward during withdrawal. Blockade of nucleus accumbens κ-opioid
  receptors may restore both dopamine levels and the hedonic set point.CREB: cAMP
  response-element binding protein; CRF: Corticotropin-releasing factor; D1: Dopamine
