caption: Signaling pathways and crosstalk mechanisms of H2S and ROS in oxidative stress.
  (A) H2S and H2O2 play positive roles in stomatal closure and the maintenance of
  redox homeostasis by regulating multiple signaling pathways. (B) Oxidative stress
  leads to the accumulation of intracellular H2S and ROS, triggering the production
  of H2S by means of desulfurizing enzyme activities, such as that of L-C/Des. (C)
  H2S and/or H2O2 positively regulate stomatal closure through post-translational
  modification mechanisms, such as protein persulfuration in the ABA signaling pathway,
  forming a complex regulatory loop with the ABA signaling pathway. (D) Potential
  sites of H2S and H2O2 interactions. H2S signaling is detected in peroxisomes, whereas
  CAT and GOx can be inhibited by H2S through PTM actions, such as persulfuration,
  thus maintaining redox homeostasis. Red upward arrows represent release pathways,
  red dashed arrows represent uncertain pathways
