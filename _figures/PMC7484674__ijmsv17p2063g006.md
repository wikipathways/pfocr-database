caption: 'The top 3 modules with relatively high scores from the protein-protein interaction
  network. Red: up-regulation; Blue: down-regulation. (A) Module 1 with 53 nodes and
  684 edges was significantly enriched in defense response, immune system process
  and immune response. (B) Module 2 with 21 nodes and 197 edges was significantly
  enriched in cell cycle phase, cell cycle and M phase of mitotic cell cycle. (C)
  Module 3 with 13 nodes and 60 edges was significantly enriched in G-protein coupled
  receptor protein, signaling pathway and chemotaxis.'
