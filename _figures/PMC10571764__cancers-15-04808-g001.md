caption: The therapeutic mechanisms involving elotuzumab and Anti-SLAMF3 in multiple
  myeloma (MM). Elotuzumab engages with various receptors and pathways to coordinate
  an immune response. It targets signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family
  receptor (SLAMF7) on both natural killer (NK) cells and MM cells, activating NK
  cells through EAT-2 and inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
  via Fc component interaction with CD16. The antibody also disrupts the homotypic
  interactions between SLAMF7 on MM cells and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), inhibiting
  adhesion. The signaling cascade initiated by elotuzumab enhances cytotoxicity through
  the ERK pathway, polarizes cytolytic granules, and enables macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent
  cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). In the context of MM, SLAMF3 molecules also play a
  role by forming connections that trigger the ERK signaling pathway and activate
  distinct transcription factors. The potential for limiting malignancy growth exists
  through antibodies targeting SLAMF3. Collectively, these mechanisms activate innate
  immune responses against MM cells and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of both elotuzumab
  and Anti-SLAMF3.
