caption: 'Proteins are imported into mitochondria through multiple pathways. In yeast,
  protein precursors are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytosol and guided to the
  TOM complex on the OMM by chaperone Hsp70 and Hsp90, with the help of co-chaperones
  Ydj1 and Sti1. In the presequence pathway (left), precursors are first recognized
  by Tom20 of the TOM complex in the cytosol. Then, precursors are handed to Tom22
  and subsequently brought through the Tom40 channel into the IMS. They are received
  by Tim50 of the TIM23 complex on the IMM and passed through to the matrix, with
  the help of the Tim44 protein and mtHsp70. The PAM complex prevents precursors from
  moving backwards out of the TIM23 complex. MPP cleaves the MTS to release proteins.
  Icp55 and Oct1 help remove any unstable amino acids from the N-terminal cleavage
  site of the proteins. Then, the presequence is degraded by PREP, and Oxa1 helps
  integrate mature proteins into the IMM when needed. In the pathways for non-cleavable
  proteins (right), carrier proteins (blue), proteins with cysteine residues (red),
  α-helical (purple), and β-barrel (brown) are shown. Carrier proteins pass through
  the TOM complex via the Tom40 channel into the IMS. Then, they are carried to their
  final location in the IMM by the TIM22 complex and other IMS chaperones. Precursors
  with cysteine residues also pass through the TOM complex via the Tom40 channel.
  Then, they are received by Mia40, which is regulated by Erv1, and helps create the
  disulfide bonds between cysteine residues and form mature proteins. α-helical precursors
  rely on Tom70 for recognition and do not localize to the IMS, as they are integrated
  into the OMM by the MIM complex. β-barrel precursors pass through the Tom40 pore
  into the IMS, and then moved to the SAM complex on the OMM via Tim chaperones, including
  Tim9, Tim10, and Tim12. Then, the SAM complex incorporates the mature proteins into
