caption: Placing datasets into a functional context using pathway analysis. Example
  transcriptional expression data were uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  application (http://www.ingenuity.com/), and its knowledgebase was used to construct
  signaling networks on the basis of known interactions from the literature. These
  approaches can allow the visualization of networks associated with viral infection
  and identify signaling “hubs” which may act as master switches of the host response.
