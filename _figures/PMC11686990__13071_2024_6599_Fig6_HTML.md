caption: Correlation analysis of differentially abundant metabolites and network analysis
  for the CE and control groups. a Visual representation of metabolite abundance utilizes
  a color-coded system, where metabolites are depicted as dots. Bright red dots signify
  significantly upregulated metabolites, while bright blue dots indicate significantly
  downregulated metabolites. Additionally, metabolic pathways are outlined by green
  boxes, and directional flow of metabolic reactions is illustrated by connecting
  lines. b Red dots represent a metabolic pathway, yellow dots represent information
  on a substance-associated regulatory enzyme, green dots illustrate a background
  substance for a metabolic pathway, purple dots represent information on the molecular
  modules of a class of substances, blue dots show chemical interactions of a substance,
  and green squares represent differential substances obtained from this comparison
