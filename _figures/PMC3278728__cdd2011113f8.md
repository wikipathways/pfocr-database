caption: 'Amplification loop model of stress-induced apoptosis. We envisage stress-induced
  apoptosis as follows: an original stress event (irradiation, heat shock) induces
  dp53 function, which activates hid and rpr transcription and also the JNK pathway.
  The JNK pathway is also able to amplify dp53 transcription (and probably to induce
  rpr and hid as well). The activation of dronc because of Hid/Rpr function gives
  rise, on one hand, to the activation of effector caspases and, on the other, to
  an increase of both Dp53 and JNK levels, thus completing the amplification loop.
  This feedback is necessary for the completion of the apoptotic program, because
  in its absence there is a dramatic reduction in the amount of cell death. The model
  implies that the cell killing function of Dronc requires amplification of its own
  levels. This is achieved by its ability to induce dp53/JNK function. The model incorporates
  the functional interactions among the various factors involved, but it does not
  contemplate their interactions at the molecular level. Some of the molecular interactions
  between Hid, Rpr, Diap1, Dronc and Drice are well known,,  but the mechanisms of
  activation of dp53 and JNK by Dronc and the specific molecular interactions between
  dp53 and JNK have not yet been described'
