caption: a | In phagocytes and dendritic cells, stimulation of surface Toll-likereceptor
  4 (TLR4) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endosomal TLR3 by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
  results in activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) via a TIR domain-containing
  adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM-1, also known as TRIF)-dependent pathway, and nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) via myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88).
  Activation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensors (melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5) or retinoic acid inducible gene 1(RIG-I) by RNA, or stimulator
  of interferon genes protein (STING) by DNA (via cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS))
  also prompt activation of IRF3. IRF3 translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription
  of IFNβ. b | In plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), activation of endosomal TLR7
  or TLR8 by RNA results in activation of IRF7 and/or IRF5. Activation of endosomal
  TLR9 by DNA or of cytosolic sensors MDA5 or RIG-I by RNA results in activation of
  IRF7. IRF7 translocates to the nucleus, where it induces transcription of type I
  interferons. Translocation of IRF5 to the nucleus culminates in transcription of
  type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In pDCs, binding of type I interferon
  to the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) results in activation of the canonical
  Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway
  that results in transcription of type I interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs
  include IRF7, which provides a feed-forward mechanism for production of more type
  I interferon. c | In macrophages and endothelial cells, TNF induces IFNβ via IRF1
  and can induce an IFNβ autocrine loop that acts in synergy with canonical TNF signals
  to induce sustained expression of inflammatory genes and delayed expression of STAT1-dependent
  ISGs that prime cells for enhanced responses to subsequent challenge. d | Receptor
  activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK)–RANK ligand (RANKL) interaction activates
  TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and c-Fos pathways. TRAF6 activation results
  in induction of NFκB. c-Fos, together with activator protein 1 (AP-1) leads to a
  cascade that promotes osteoclastogenesis. NF-κB and c-Fos stimulate production of
  IFNβ. IFNβ promotes transcription of genes that inhibit c-Fos activity and results
  in the induction of nitric oxide (NO), which inhibits osteoclastogenesis. cGAMP,
