caption: 'Prothoracicotropic hormone/DHR4 generate cyclic steroid pulses that drive
  directional developmental transitions. A model illustrating the mechanisms generating
  8–16 h ultradian steroid oscillations. (A) Each cycle is initiated by the release
  of PTTH from terminals of brain neurons that activates the Ras pathway in the PG.
  This results in the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of pERK and translocation
  of DHR4 to the cytoplasm, which derepresses ecdysone biosynthesis. (B) In the presence
  of PTTH, the DHR4 repressor is displaced from promoters, including Cyp6t3 increasing
  its expression. During periods without PTTH signaling, nuclear DHR4 represses gene
  expression, although DHR4 may act as an activator in some cases. pErk, phospho-ERK;
  PG, prothoracic gland; PRE, PTTH response element; PTTH, prothoracicotropic hormone.
  Torso: the transmembrane PTTH receptor in the PG. Dashed arrows indicate inactive
  mechanisms.'
