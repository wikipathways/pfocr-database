caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and glycosylated EMT targets. (A)
  First, the rate limiting enzyme of the HBP, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase
  (GFAT), uses glutamine (Gln) as an amine donor to convert Fru-6P into glucosamine-6-P
  (GlcN-6P). Second, glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNPNAT) N-acetylates
  GlcN-6P in an acetyl-CoA-mediated reaction to form N-acetylglucosamine-6-P (GlcNAc-6P).
  Third, phosphoglucomutase (PGM) isomerizes GlcNAc-6P to the highly active GlcNAc-1P.
  The final step is catalyzed by UDP–N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP1)
  and charges GlcNAc-1P with UDP to form uridine-5′-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP–GlcNAc). (B) UDP–GlcNAc (depicted as a blue square) is essential for N-glycosylation
  processing and elongation. One critical pivot point includes the branching of complex
  N-glycans. Inhibiting this process with a bisecting GlcNAc is associated with tumor
  suppressive phenotypes. In contrast, cancers have aberrant expression of glycosyltransferases
  responsible for branching and elongating complex N-glycans. (C) Many of the proteins
  commonly associated with promoting EMT are modified by glycans containing GlcNAc
  and are found on the cell surface. Hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan, is also found
  extracellularly and is a polymer of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. Many
  nuclear, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins are modified by monosaccharides
  of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), including many transcription factors,
  which appear to be stabilized by glycosylation (). Numerous studies have identified
  various cancers with elevated levels of pan-O-GlcNAcylation ().
