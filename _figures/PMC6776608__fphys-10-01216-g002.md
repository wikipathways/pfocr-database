caption: Navigating the Myo-REG resource. (A) In the homepage a network of the cell
  interactions occurring in muscle regeneration is the main entry point to the information
  annotated in Myo-REG. By clicking on any edges, a pop-up window is displayed (B)
  showing the annotation for the selected interaction. By clicking a cell icon, a
  pop-up window is displayed offering the possibility to select either the “Cell interactions”
  or the “Pathways” tabs. (C) By selecting the pathway tab the user can choose to
  display a network representation of the pathways that are relevant for that cell
  type. (D) The annotation of an interaction (e.g., INSR-PI3K) displayed after clicking
  the edge on the graph. (E) The cell–cell interactions graph displayed for a selected
  cell type (FAP). (F) The annotation of an interaction displayed after clicking on
  an edge of the graph. Edge colors represent distinct interaction types according
  to the legend displayed on the top-left corner of the graph. Icons with three green
  circles represent cytokines participating in the process of muscle regeneration.
