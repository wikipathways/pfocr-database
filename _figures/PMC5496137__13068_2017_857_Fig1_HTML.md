caption: 'The central metabolic pathways of E. coli connecting glycerol catabolism
  to n-butanol synthesis. The catabolic route of glycerol includes the glpK-glpD and
  the gldA-dhaKLM pathways. The heterologous pathway for the synthesis of n-butanol
  is composed of phaA, hbd, crt, ter, and adhE2 genes (dotted line). The genes involved
  in the metabolic pathways: aceEF-lpdA*: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; adhE, aldehyde–alcohol
  dehydrogenase; adhE2, butyraldehyde–butanol dehydrogenase; crt, crotonse; hbd, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; ldhA, lactate dehydrogenase; fba, fructose bisphosphate aldolase;
  fbp, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase; frdABCD, fumarate reductase; pflB, pyruvate-formate
  lyase; gltA, citrate synthase; glpF, glycerol facilitator; gldA, glycerol dehydrogenase;
  dhaKLM, dihydroxyacetone kinase; glpK, glycerol kinase; glpD, glycerol 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; pgi, phosphoglucose isomerase; pgl, lactonase; phaA, acetoacetyl-CoA
  thiolase; pta, phosphate acetyltransferase; ter, trans-enoyl-CoA reductase; udhA,
  transhydrogenase; zwf, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The undesired genes in
  the pathways are deleted as marked with “X.” ACE acetate; EtOH ethanol; DHAP dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; FDP fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; F6P fructose-6-phosphate; LAC lactate;
  FOM formate; G6P glucose-6-phosphate; CIT citrate; OAA oxaloacetate; PEP phosphoenolpyruvate;
  3-PGA 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde; PYR pyruvate; SUC succinate'
