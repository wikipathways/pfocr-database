caption: 'Canonical or Wnt/β-catenin–TCF/LEF signaling. Three Wnt-dependent pathways
  have been proposed: canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway and non-canonical Wnt/PCP and
  Wnt/Ca2+ pathways. In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (a), in the absence of
  Wnt ligands (or in the presence of Wnt inhibitor WIF, sFRPs, or Dkk1), cytosolic
  β-catenin (β-cat) is targeted to proteolytic degradation through phosphorylation
  by adenomatous poliposis coli (APC)–Axin–glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)–casein
  kinase 1 (CK1) destruction complex. Phosphorylated β-cat becomes ubiquitinated through
  action of β-transducin repeat containing protein–(β-TrCP)-dependent E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex and degraded in the proteasome. In the active state, Wnt ligand binding
  to Fzd receptors and their coreceptors Lrp5/6 leads to the activation of the cytoplasmic
  protein dishevelled (Dvl), and subsequent recruitment of Axin complex to the Lrp
  coreceptor, resulting in inhibition of the β-catenin destruction complex. Consequently,
  hypophosphorylated β-cat accumulate in the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus, where
  it regulates target gene expression through partnerships with the TCR/LEF1 family
  of transcription factors, resulting in changes in gene transcription. Two types
  of proteins, Norrin and R-spondins (Rspo), which are unrelated to Wnt, act as Wnt
  agonists. In the non-canonical Wnt–Ca2+signaling pathway (b), the binding of Wnt
  promotes Fzd-mediated activation of pertussis Toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric guanine
  nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). This, in turn, stimulates the release
  of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which leads to the activation of Ca2+-dependent
  effector molecules. Several Ca2+-sensitive targets – protein kinase C (PKC), Ca2+–calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CamKII), and the Ca2+–calmodulin-sensitive protein phosphatase
  calcineurin – have been identified downstream of the Wnt–Ca2+pathway. Targets of
  the Wnt–Ca2+pathway appear to interact with the Wnt–β-catenin pathway at multiple
  points. Additionally, Fzd receptors in association with Kny, Ror2, or Ryk receptors
  can activate JNK, promoting target gene expression through AP-1. In the non-canonical
  Wnt/PCP pathway, the binding of Wnts activates RhoA/B, Cdc42, or Rac1. Dsh activates
  Rac1 and Rac1 can also activate JNK, resulting in the NFAT pathway. Abbreviations:
