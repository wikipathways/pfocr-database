caption: (a) Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were transduced with lentivirus
  encoding the indicated shRNAs. At the indicated time point after stimulation with
  IFN-γ and zymosan, macrophages were lysed and subjected to metabolomic profiling.
  (b) Pathway activity map illustrating increased flux through the pentose phosphate
  pathway on Pfkl knockdown. Red text indicates elevated, and blue text indicates
  reduced metabolite on Pfkl knockdown. (c) RAW264.7 cells were transduced with the
  indicated shRNAs, and NADPH levels were quantified by enzymatic cycling assay. Data
  represent the mean of triplicates±s.d. *P≤0.05 as determined by Student's t-test.
