caption: General mechanism of ferroptosis associated with lipid, amino acid, and iron
  metabolism. The inactive Fe3+ is delivered into the cell by TFR1 and reduced to
  Fe2+ in the endosome. Then, DMT1 transports Fe2+ to the labile iron pool (LIP).
  Autophagic degradation of ferritin (ferritinophagy) releases Fe2+ from ferritin,
  which is mediated by NCOA4. Fe2+ produces lipid ROS via the Fenton reaction and
  through the LOX pathway. Moreover, ACSL4 is required to activate polyunsaturated
  fatty acid, especially AA and AdA, to AA/AdA-CoA, then LPCAT3 catalyzes these derivatives
  and membrane PEs to form AA/AdA-PE, which are further converted into pro-ferroptotic
  lipid peroxidation under the activity of iron-containing LOXs. In conclusion, the
  Fenton reaction and oxidation of lipids facilitate the generation of lipid ROS,
  thus leading to ferroptosis. The system xc- is a cystine/glutamate antiporter. Intracellular
  cystine is reduced to cysteine for the biosynthesis of GSH. GPX4 converts two GSH
  molecules to GSSG each catalytic cycle to reduce lipid hydroperoxides, and then
  GSSG can be recycled back via GSH reductase in an NADPH-dependent manner. Ferroptosis
  inducers inhibit the GPX4-GSH-cysteine axis, thus inhibiting the reduction of lipid
  ROS. AA/AdA, arachidonic acid or adrenic acid; AA/AdA-CoA, arachidonic acid or adrenic
