caption: A model of estradiol action on hypothalamic cells involved in the regulation
  of the LH surge. Circulating estradiol acts on both neurons and astrocytes. The
  astrocyte has been expanded to illustrate the potential intracellular pathway of
  estradiol signaling that regulates progesterone (PROG) synthesis. Estradiol acts
  on membrane estrogen receptors (ER); both ERα and ERβ have been reported in astrocyte
  membranes (). Activated ER increase [Ca2+]i by interacting with metabotropic glutamate
  receptor type 1a (mGluR1a) to initiate the phospholipase C (PLC)/ inositol triphosphate
  receptor (IP3R) mediated increase in [Ca2+]i. The source of the elevated [Ca2+]i
  is the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER). Estradiol-induced release of Ca2+ was
  mimicked with thapsigargin. Calcium may activate protein kinase A (PKA) and/or protein
  kinase C (PKC) phosphorylate StAR. StAR mediated transport of cholesterol (CHOL)
  through the mitochondrial intermembrane space is the rate limiting step of steroidogenesis.
  In the inner mitochondrial membrane, cholesterol (CHOL) is converted to pregnenolone
  (PREG) by cytochrome P450side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). PREG is converted
  to PROG in the sER via the action of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isomerase (3β-HSD)
  and diffuses out of the astrocyte to encounter estradiol induced PROG receptors
  (PR) in neurons. PR expressing neurons mediate the environmental and circadian signals
  to neurons stimulating GnRH. GnRH release in the median eminence in turn initiates
  the LH surge release from anterior pituitary gonadotrophs (modified from ().
