caption: Regulatory circuits operating in osteoblast lineage cells. a | Activation
  and attenuation pathways. From top, BMP2 induces Hoxa10 which activates Runx2.,
  Runx2 downregulates expression of the cluster miR23a~27a~24-2 directly through a
  Runx regulatory element in the promoter for this cluster, which results in increased
  Runx2 and its coregulator SATB2 protein, that are targets of the cluster miRNAs.
  Runx2, SATB2 and ATF4 form an activating complex that is essential for differentiation.
  The cluster becomes robustly elevated at mineralization through a feedback mechanism
  by which miR-27a suppresses Hoxa10 and miR-23a attenuates Runx2 protein. This feedforward
  and feed reverse circuit exemplifies the central role of this microRNA cluster in
  promoting and attenuating the progression of differentiation to regulate bone formation.
  b | Amplification mechanism. Two microRNAs form the cluster miR-2861~miR-3960, each
  of which targets inhibitors of Runx2 activity, HDAC5 and Hoxa2, respectively. This
  downregulation increases Runx2 transcriptional activity. The effect is amplified
  because Runx2 transactivates the cluster through a Runx2 binding site in the cluster’s
  promoter. Thus, a regulatory circuit exists where Runx2 and a microRNA cluster operate
  in a coordinate manner. c | Pathway synergism. BMP2 downregulates miRNAs that suppress
  two essential factors for osteogenesis that form a transcriptional complex. The
  integration of Runx2 and miRNAs occurs at two levels—Runx2 regulation of miRNA expression
  and miRNA blockade of Runx2 inhibitors.
