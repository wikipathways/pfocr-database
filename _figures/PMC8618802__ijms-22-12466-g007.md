caption: 'Crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy. There is complex crosstalk between
  these two pathways, and they interact in different ways and situations. P53 is the
  master regulator of cell death and is activated via various cellular inputs, e.g.,
  in response to DNA damage. Activation of P53 leads to apoptosis while inhibiting
  autophagy. Additionally, apoptosis can activate or inhibit autophagy based on the
  cell status. The mitochondrial outer membrane potential is disrupted upon activation
  of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, leading to MPT. In this situation, the number
  of affected mitochondria determines the cell fate. If only a few mitochondria are
  affected, autophagy activity can eliminate them, leading to cell survival. However,
  when there are more mitochondria affected, apoptotic death will be the cellular
  fate. In certain situations, when the majority of mitochondria are affected by MPT,
  the cell undergoes necrosis. In addition, caspases are major proteins in apoptotic
  pathways whose enzymatic activity can activate the autophagy pathway by cleaving
  the precursor of ATG proteins or suppress autophagy by cleaving ATG proteins. Autophagy,
  in turn, could activate or suppress apoptosis. For instance, phosphatidylserine
  exposure following apoptosis could be a save-me or eat-me signal which activates
  autophagy. The stress level could tip the balance between life and death through
  autophagy activity. Autophagy can save cells by cleaning malfunctioning proteins,
  organelles, and so forth, or, upon prolonged exposure to stress, it can activate
  cell death. DRAM-1: DNA damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1; MOMP: mitochondrial
