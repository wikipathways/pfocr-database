caption: Differing scenarios for nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
  activation in renal fibrosis. (A) The downregulation of Nrf2 (↓Nrf2) induces the
  upregulation of the transcription growth factor-beta1 (↑TGF-β1), inducing fibrosis
  by promoting the production of fibronectin (FN) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).
  In addition, ↓Nrf2 leads to the downregulation of catalase (↓catalase), upregulating
  the generation of angiotensinogen, which converts into angiotensin II (Ang II).
  Then, Ang II interacts with angiotensin receptor 1 (ATR1), upregulating the RAS
  pathway. Nrf2 downregulation also induces the decrease in heme oxygenase-1 (↓HO-1),
  promoting apoptosis and fibrosis. (B) In contrast, the upregulation of Nrf2 (↑Nrf2)
  induces fibrosis and hypertension. This mechanism is attributed to ROS overproduction,
  generated via advanced glycation end products (AGEs) by binding to its receptor
  (RAGE), which activates Nrf2. This mechanism induces Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus
  with the positioning in Ang/ACE promoter, which leads to fibrosis []. The figure
  was created using BioRender.
