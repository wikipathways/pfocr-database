caption: Regulation of the ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30 and its connection to cell cycle
  control. SCFMet30 ubiquitinates the transcriptional activator Met4 on lysine 163
  to maintain it in an inactive state. Degradation of poly-ubiquitinated Met4 is prevented
  by an ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) in Met4. The sulfur containing compounds
  methionine, cysteine, and S-adenosylmethionine stimulate Met4 ubiquitination, but
  when their intracellular concentrations are low, reduced ubiquitination combined
  with Met4 deubiquitination by a so far unidentified deubiquitinating enzyme(s) (Ubp)
  leads to Met4 activation. Cadmium and arsenic stress inhibit Met4 ubiquitination
  by inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase SCFMet30. The resulting activation of Met4
  raises cellular glutathione levels due to induced expression of Gsh1. Active Met4
  induces expression of a number of genes involved in the sulfur amino acid synthesis
  pathway (MET-genes) as well as GSH1. MET-gene expression depends on either one of
  the two homologous zinc-finger proteins Met31 and Met32. Met4 activation also inhibits
  a number of cell cycle events and can lead to cell cycle arrest. The Met4-dependent
  cell cycle arrest requires Met32 but cannot be mediated by Met31.
