caption: Adipose tissue signaling in breast cancer. (A) Leptin, a major adipocytokine
  released by adipose tissue binds to the leptin receptor and activates the JAK2-STAT3
  pathway leading to proliferation and stemness of BC cells. Leptin transactivated
  HER2 receptor in absence of its ligand via JAK2, which leads to BC survival. Leptin
  also activates the ER receptor in absence of estrogens and, furthermore, inhibits
  its proteasomal degradation. (B) Aromatase secreted by adipose tissue converts androgens
  to estrogens leading to an increase in BC risk. (C) Visfatin increases the MAPK-ERK
  pathway through an unknown receptor thereby increasing BC proliferation. Activated
  MAPK also activates STAT3 signaling. (D) FABP4 expression is transcriptionally activated
  by the ERK-Ets1 pathway. Upon activation, FABP4 increases proliferation and migration
  of BC cells by nuclear accumulation of PPARγ and SREB2. Furthermore, FABP4 translocates
  to the cytoplasm where it binds to RA and, therefore, leads to cell differentiation.
  (E) Adiponectin increases the insulin signaling, glucose uptake, decreases glycogen
  synthesis and inhibits STAT3 and NFκB mediated signaling leading to the inhibition
  of BC survival and progression. (F) SFRP1 signaling through the integrin receptor
  inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines, TGFβ and Wnt signaling, thereby inhibiting
  BC progression.
