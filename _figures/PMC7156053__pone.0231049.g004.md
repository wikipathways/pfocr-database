caption: '(A) The 107 protein interactions of 44 DEGs in cytokine-mediated signaling
  pathway. (B) The 111 protein interactions of 25 DEGs in DNA repair system. The bar
  charts in node show the fold-changes in hPNs (left bar), hNCCs (middle bar), and
  mDCs (right bar) infected with ZIKV. Fold-changes were calculated using log2 (fold-change).
  Red circle: genes that are upregulated in mDCs as opposed to hPNs and hNCCs; blue
  circle: genes that are downregulated in mDCs as opposed to hPNs and hNCCs.'
