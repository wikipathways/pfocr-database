caption: Signaling model for late-phase IP-10 induction by MRP8/14 in endotoxic mice.
  At the beginning of endotoxemia, MRP8/14 is released from activated neutrophils
  into the blood. Extracellular MRP8/14 binds to TLR4 on the surface of macrophages
  to induce IFNβ production and release. Then, IFNβ activates the JAK1/TYK2-STAT1
  signaling pathway by binding with IFNAR, resulting in irf7 gene transcription and
  IRF7 protein synthesis. As a transcription factor, IRF7 promotes Ip-10 gene transcription,
  resulting in sustained production of IP-10 in the late phase of endotoxemia. Finally,
  the accumulated IP-10 attracts a large number of CXCR3+ lymphocytes to the site
  of infection, leading to an over-reactive inflammatory response and lung injury.
