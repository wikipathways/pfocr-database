caption: Map of cytoskeleton remodeling pathway (Genego Metacore, fragment) overlapped
  with quantile-normalized estimations of protein abundance. Flags indicate direction
  of change (red, up-increased, blue; down-decreased) and fold change (length) of
  protein abundance in relation to non-treated control. 1, IGF-1 and 2, Resveratrol.
  Results were expressed as mean for three replicate experiments for each treatment
  group.
