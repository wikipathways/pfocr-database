caption: Schematic diagram of carbon metabolism and BC biosynthesis pathways in Komagataeibacter
  sp. W1. The comprehensive analysis was conducted by incorporating the key metabolic
  intermediates and associated enzymes responsible for carbon source transformation
  and BC biosynthesis in different KEGG pathways. The numbers in the figure are the
  Enzyme Commission number, while the red and black ones indicate the associated enzymes
  present and absent respectively in Komagataeibacter sp. W1. The asterisks indicate
  the enzymes absent in the labeled pathways but present in other pathways in our
  study, thus it is unknown whether they work in the labeled pathways. The question
  mark indicating whether the pathway is present, is unclear based on our data and
  remains for future investigations. More information of the enzymes and the associated
  genes and pathways (ko numbers) are listed in . P, phosphate; GDP, guanosine diphosphate;
  UDP, uridine diphosphate; PRPP, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate; ThPP, thiamine diphosphate;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A.
