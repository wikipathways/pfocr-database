caption: Negative regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. (A) SOCS1 and SOCS3 bind directly
  to tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK via the SH2 domain, thereby inhibiting kinase activity.
  CIS inhibits STST by competing with STAT for docking position on receptors. An alternative
  regulatory approach is provided by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which binds
  the SOCS box motif and ubiquitinates related proteins that target proteasomal degradation.
  (B) IL-6 family members bind to a common receptor subunit, gp130, which produce
  either homodimer or heterodimer when the ligand binds. JAK protein activation mediates
  downstream signal transduction through the MAPK and STAT3 pathways. The STAT3 dimer
  translocates to the nucleus and binds to common sequences in gene promoters including
  VEGF, MMP-9, IL-6 and SOCS3. SOCS3 inhibits cytoplasmic JAK activation and subsequent
  signal transduction, while PIAS3 inhibits DNA binding of STAT3 in the nucleus. The
  pharmacological inhibition of JAK activity by AG490 and WP1066 suppressed the signal
  leading to STAT3 activation, and various PTPs endogenously inhibit STAT3 activity.
  Hydroxobenzene sulfonate inhibits STAT3-mediated gene expression by attenuating
  STAT3-activated upstream kinase signaling. SOCS, suppressor of cytokine signaling;
  CIS, cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein; PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatase;
  FGF, fibroblast growth factor; PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated STAT; OSM, oncostatin
