caption: Metabolic pathways expressed in the deep subsurface. Pathways of N, S, and
  C metabolisms are enclosed in blue, yellow, and brown envelopes, respectively. Black
  and gray solid lines indicate reactions mediated by enzymes, whereas black dotted
  lines in the N cycle indicate abiotic reactions. PEG transcripts and the encoded
  enzymes detected in this study are denoted by ellipses, appended with coverage (mapped
  read counted normalized to PEG transcript length) and, if detected, the number of
  peptide spectral matches in metaproteome. Green-outlined enzymes are encoded by
  PEG transcripts related to Sulfuritalea and Thauera. Enzymes in gray operate in
  both autotrophic and heterotrophic C metabolisms, and the PEG transcripts detected
  in this study were closely related to those of autotrophs and heterotrophs. NifH
  gene, encoding for dinitrogenase reductase subunit H, was detected by RT-PCR cloning
  (). A complete list of proteins detected in the PEG transcriptome and metaproteome
  is provided in . ANAMMOX, anaerobic ammonium oxidation; ANME, anaerobic methane
  oxidation (upward direction); CBB, Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle or reductive pentose
  phosphate cycle; DNRA, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia; EMP, Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
  glycolysis (downward direction); GLUCO, gluconeogenesis (upward direction); 3-HP/4-HB,
  3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycle; MEGEN, methanogenesis (downward
  direction); nd, not detected; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; rTCA, reverse tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; SERINE, formaldehyde assimilation via serine pathway; WL, Wood–Ljundahl
  or reductive acetyl-CoA pathway.

  description: Metabolic pathways expressed in the deep subsurface. Pathways of N,
    S, and C metabolisms are enclosed in blue, yellow, and brown envelopes, respectively.
    Black and gray solid lines indicate reactions mediated by enzymes, whereas black
    dotted lines in the N cycle indicate abiotic reactions. PEG transcripts and the
    encoded enzymes detected in this study are denoted by ellipses, appended with
    coverage (mapped read counted normalized to PEG transcript length) and, if detected,
    the number of peptide spectral matches in metaproteome. Green-outlined enzymes
    are encoded by PEG transcripts related to Sulfuritalea and Thauera. Enzymes in
    gray operate in both autotrophic and heterotrophic C metabolisms, and the PEG
    transcripts detected in this study were closely related to those of autotrophs
    and heterotrophs. NifH gene, encoding for dinitrogenase reductase subunit H, was
