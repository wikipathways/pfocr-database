caption: 'Arachidonic acid is first metabolized by COX-1 or COX-2 to synthesize PGH2.
  Five different types of prostaglandin synthases act on this intermediate to generate
  the various eicosanoids shown above. In addition, subsequent dehydration/isomerization
  of PGD2 can create 15d-PGJ2. With the exception of three eicosanoids, 15d-PGJ2,
  PGD2, and PGI2, all of the COX-derived eicosanoids are thought to be pro-tumorigenic.
  COX-derived eicosanoids in green are pro-tumorigenic, while those in blue are anti-tumorigenic.
  Abbreviations are as followed: 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2), arachidonic acid
  (AA), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α),
  prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), and thromboxane A2 (TXA2).'
