caption: Mechanism for ABC transporters regulated by the level of PI3K 110α or 110β
  subunit. The level of P110 subunits may regulate P-gp and BCRP directly, altering
  drug-sensitivity of the cells and yielding changed cell proliferation and survival
  ability. Knockout of P110 subunits induced down-regulation of P-gp and BCRP, and
  suggested the potentiality of P110α and P110β to be applied as targets for reversal
  of MDR of cancers. This route can be separate from AKT activation that had been
  regarded as a downstream effect in PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, playing an important
  role in the activation of many factors through phosphorylation. Italic characters
  indicate the major function of CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of P110α or P110β from the MDR
  cancer cells
papertitle: The PI3K subunits, P110α and P110β are potential targets for overcoming
  P-gp and BCRP-mediated MDR in cancer.
