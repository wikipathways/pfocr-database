caption: Hypothetical framework explaining the associations between circulating erythritol
  levels and adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. (a) Elevated circulating erythritol
  may result from a dysregulated Pentose Phosphate Pathway secondary to impaired glycemia
  (hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes) or due to a high-sugar diet. Impaired
  glycemia is a risk factor for adverse cardiometabolic outcomes. (b) Elevated circulating
  erythritol may activate platelets and enhance aggregation. This may directly increase
  the risk of cardiovascular disease and indirectly increase the risk of other cardiometabolic
  diseases via increased inflammation and oxidative stress. The arrows designated
  in grey are hypothetical and require further research.
