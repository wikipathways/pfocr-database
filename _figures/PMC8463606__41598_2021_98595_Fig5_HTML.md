  bright yellow islands (BYIs) compared to the corresponding dark green surrounding
  tissues. (I) Molecular pathways associated with photosynthesis and vegetative leaf
  shape regulation are engaged in negative regulatory loops with jasmonic acid (JA)
  signaling, which could instigate RNA silencing and phenylpropanoid pathway activity.
  (II) Oxidative stress regulation by cellular antioxidant molecules: SOD, GR and
  GST, is reinforced by the phenolic coumarin products of the phenylpropanoid pathway.
  (III) JA signaling could upregulate the phenylpropanoid pathway, which is important
  for oxidative stress alleviation and induction of systemic acquired resistance response
  to tobamovirus infections. Molecular pathways and effectors differentially modified
  in ''late post-recovery stage'' BYIs were circled. Molecular pathways presumed to
  be affected according to literature data were squared. Dotted purple colors mark
  downregulation effects; blue colors (small dots) mark upregulation effects. SPL
