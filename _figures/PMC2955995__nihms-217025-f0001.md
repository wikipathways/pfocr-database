caption: 'Both receptors and ligands contain multiple conserved domains. Notch is
  a single-pass transmembrane receptor. The extracellular domain contains EGF-like
  repeats and a cysteine-rich region. The intracellular domain contains the RAM domain,
  NLS, ANK, TAD and PEST domain. Notch ligands have multiple EGF-like repeats in their
  extracellular domain and a CR in Jagged which are absent in Delta. B, Schematic
  of Notch signaling. Notch signaling is activated after ligand binding to an adjacent
  Notch receptor between two neighboring cells. Upon activation, Notch receptors undergo
  a series of proteolytic cleavages by the metalloprotease, TACE, and γ-secretase
  complex. The cleavage releases the NICD into the cytoplasm, which can subsequently
  translocate into the nucleus. In the absence of NICD, transcription of Notch target
  genes is inhibited by a repressor complex mediated by the CSL. When NICD is in the
  nucleus, it forms an active transcriptional complex due to displacing the histone
  deacetylase-corepressor complex and recruiting the protein MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases
  to the CSL complex, leading to convert it from a transcriptional repressor into
  a transcription activator complex, leading to activation of Notch target genes.
