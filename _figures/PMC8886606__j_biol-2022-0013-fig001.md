caption: The multicellular participation mechanism participated in establishing the
  Con A-induced liver injury mouse model. Con A was capable of attaching to MHC class
  II, MR, and ICMA-1. Th0 cell differentiated into Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg by the
  recognition of MHC class II-Con A complex via TCR, and Th1 and Th17 induced the
  hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis by secreting TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17, and IL-22, while
  Th2 and Treg would induce tolerance toward Con A by secreting IL-10 or expressing
  CTLA. Th0 could also migrate to the inflamed tissue by adhering to CXCLs via CXCR3.
  The NKT directly induced the death of hepatocytes or SECs by expressing TNF-α and
  IFN-γ after combining with this lectin through TCR. The MRs, located on the surface
  of macrophages and neutrophils, contain multiple CTLD, and the N-acetylglucosamine
  of Con A can combinate to the MRs to induce the receptor-mediated endocytosis and
  phagocytosis to maintain the stability of the internal environment. At the same
  time, Con A also can lead to the activation of macrophages and neutrophils via MRs,
  to increase the release of superoxide anions and induce the synthesis of cytokines
  (including TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, MIP-2, and ROS). Con A promoted the expression of
  β 2-integrin on neutrophils, which was essential for neutrophil recruitment. The
  attachment of SECs to Con via MR, MHC class II, and ICAM-1 could give rise to their
  death, facilitating the adhesion of Con A to KCs. CTLs would activate by the Con
  A-mediated expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ and infiltrate to the necrotic area by
  recognizing MHC class I expressed on the surface of damaged hepatocytes, which is
  absent from the normal liver tissue. Both CTLs and NKTs contributed to the apoptosis
  of hepatic cells via the Fas/FasL pathway.
