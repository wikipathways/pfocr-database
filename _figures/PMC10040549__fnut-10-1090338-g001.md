caption: The molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis. Fe3+ is the predominant form of
  iron in circulation, which often combines with Trf and can be imported into cells
  via Trf1 located on cellular membrane. In addition, a part of iron can be imported
  into cells by SLC39A14 in the form of Fe2+. The Fe3+ within cells is firstly reduced
  to Fe2+ in the lysosome catalyzed by STEAP3, and then, ZIP 8/14 or DMT1 leads to
  the release of Fe2+ from the lysosome into LIP. Moreover, the Fe3+ in cells can
  also be stored in ferritin. NCOA4 can recognize ferritin and mediate ferritinophagy,
  reducing stored Fe3+ to Fe2+ and ultimately releasing Fe2+ into LIP. Furthermore,
  ferroportin is mainly in charge of the export of Fe2+ from cells. If the iron metabolism
  is disrupted, excessive Fe2+ will trigger lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. PUFAs,
  as the most predominant substrates of lipid peroxidation, are firstly converted
  to PUFA-PLs by ACSL4 and LPCAT3. In the enzymatic pathway, LOXs oxidize PUFA-PLs
  to PUFA-PLOOH. In the non-enzymatic pathway, the excessive Fe2+ firstly reacts with
  ROS to generate OH∙ via Fenton reaction, which then abstracts hydrogen from PUFA-PL
  and forms PUFA-PL∙. Subsequently, O2 oxidizes PUFA-PL∙ to PUFA-PLOO∙, which abstracts
  hydrogen from the adjacent PUFA-PL and facilitates the propagation of lipid peroxidation.
  Ultimately, the overwhelming lipid peroxidation results in cellular membrane destruction
  and ferroptosis. ACSL4, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4; NCOA4, nuclear
