caption: IPA protein interaction network analysis. The phosphoproteomic data from
  IMAC and antibody enrichments was combined and analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) software. (A) Phosphoproteomic data mapped onto the IPA canonical network
  Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer for SU11274 (left) and staurosporine (right) treatments.
  Protein nodes highlighted in violet and/or grey were identified in the study. Proteins
  are color-coded with peptides that changed >2.5-fold up (green), down >2.5-fold
  (red), or both up and down >2.5-fold (yellow) with the indicated treatment. (B)
  IPA analysis was also run for each treatment including only proteins with peptides
  that changed >2.5-fold. Examples of networks generated de novo by IPA for SU11274
  (left) and staurosporine (right) treatments are shown and color-coded as in A.
