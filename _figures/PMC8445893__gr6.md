caption: Schematic representation of the role of the HNF4α/miR-467b-3p/GPAT1 pathway
  in the improvement of NAFLD. There are 2 major pathways for the synthesis of TAG.
  In the monoacylglycerol (MAG) pathway, predominantly reported in the intestine,
  monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) produces diacylglycerol (DAG) by covalently
  joining a fatty acyl moiety to MAG. In the glycerol phosphate pathway, which functions
  in most cells, glycerol-3-phosphate (glycerol-3-P) is acylated sequentially by GPAT
  and acylglycerol phosphate acyltransferase (AGPAT) to produce LysoPA and phosphatidic
  acid (PA), respectively. DAG derived from the dephosphorylation of PA becomes TAG.
  During the development of hepatic steatosis, miR-467b-3p expression decreases in
  the liver, which leads to the increase of GPAT1 expression and the consequent increase
  in TAG synthesis. Conversely, up-regulation of miR-467b-3p inhibits hepatic lipid
  accumulation and ameliorates NAFLD. HNF4α mediates the induction of miR-467b-3p
  in hepatocytes. Ginger polyphenol, 6-G, promotes HNF4α induction, the up-regulation
  of miR-467b-3p, and the improvement of steatosis. Therefore, the regulation of the
  HNF4α/miR-467b-3p/GPAT1 cascade is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment
  of NAFLD.
