caption: Tbx5 is required for a mesoderm–endoderm bidirectional signaling loop for
  cardiopulmonary development. Model of genetic interaction between Tbx5, canonical
  Wnt signaling, and Hh signaling for PE specification, pulmonary morphogenesis, and
  cardiac septation. TBX5, expressed in the CPPs (purple) initiates the bidirectional
  signaling loop through direct activation of Wnt2 and Wnt2b expression. Canonical
  Wnt signaling drives pulmonary specification in the foregut endoderm and Nkx2-1
  expression. SHH, derived from the PE (green) signals back to the CPPs where it cooperatively
  activates Wnt2b but not Wnt2. Shh signaling drives both atrial septation and lung
  bud morphogenesis through previously described downstream targets.
