caption: Schematic diagram of the CCL2/CCR2 axis and its associated signaling pathways.
  CCR2, a classic G protein-coupled receptor, activates a variety of downstream signaling
  pathways upon binding to its ligand CCL2, such as PI3K/Akt, JAK/STAT, and P38/MAPK.
  Activation of these pathways leads to the regulation of various transcription factors
  and genes involved in cell survival, proliferation, cytokine production, migration,
  and apoptosis. This figure was created with biogdp.com
