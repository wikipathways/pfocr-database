caption: 'Dual polyamine catabolic model for signaling plant abiotic and biotic stress
  defense. A stress signal is recognized by numerous sensors and is transferred by
  several cellular biochemical pathways. Abiotic and biotic stresses result in ROS
  production. The stress-signaling pathway gives also rise to intracellular PAs, which
  are secreted/oxidized in the apoplast by PAOs in order to supply H2O2 and several
  N compounds. Hydrogen peroxide and N molecules may involve further reactions, including,
  among others, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and Oxidative Signal Inducible
  1 (OXI1) pathways (; ,, ; ; ; ; ). Under abiotic conditions, according to the H2O2
  level created: ① when low (H2O2 below a specific threshold), it is powerfully scavenged
  leading to abiotic defense or ② when high (H2O2 over a specific threshold), it cannot
  be efficiently scavenged and PCD is caused. The abiotic tolerance stress signal
  (③) is received by plants generating essential signal molecules like ABA that are
  involved in an augmentation of PA synthesis rendering tolerance in plants (). Under
  biotic stress conditions, mostly Spm is secreted in the apoplast and oxidized by
  the respective enriched PAO, causing a H2O2 buildup (④, biotic defense) that protects
  plants from phytopathogenic bacteria. In the scavenging process, antioxidant enzymes
  are involved, such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX), in a procedure rendering defense
  reactions. The implication of PA oxidation to H2O2 production is not only a matter
  of apoplastic or cytoplastic PAOs. Polyamines are also back-converted in peroxisome,
  with the parallel generation of H2O2 and nitrogenous substances. Peroxisomally produced
  H2O2 might trigger Ca2+-penetrable canals (; ; ; ). However, the N compounds generated
  as a result of the PA back-conversion path are not yet elucidated. Further details
