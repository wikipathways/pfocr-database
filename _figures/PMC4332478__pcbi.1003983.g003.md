caption: Copy number alterations for a selection of predicted hub regulators are indicated
  for canonical glioblastoma signaling pathways p53, RB and RTK/PI3K. Genes selected
  by the algorithm are indicated in black boxes, while light grey boxes depict genes
  that were not selected by the algorithm but are key factors for the pathway. Purple
  hexagons indicate phenotypes. Percentage of copy gain or loss is indicated by value
  and by color shades of red for gene gains and green for gene losses. The values
  are taken from GISTIC putative calls for low-levels gains or single-copy losses
  on 563 glioblastoma samples (data from the Broad institute).
