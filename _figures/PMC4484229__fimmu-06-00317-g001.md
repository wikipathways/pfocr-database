caption: Structure of C1q. The hexameric C1q molecule (460 kDa) has a tulip-like structure,
  composed of nine non-covalently linked subunits of six A, B, and C chains; A–B dimer
  is 52,750 Da and C–C dimer is 47,600 Da. Fragments of C1q after pepsin digestion
  at pH 4.4 contain six intact connecting strands and small non-collagen-like peptides.
  After partial proteolysis with collagenase at pH 7.4, the globular regions (gC1q)
  appear intact. C1q binds to Fc regions of IgG or IgM, HIV-1, phosphatidylserine,
  HTLV-1, C-reactive protein, damaged neurons, myelin debris, amyloid fibrils, and
  apoptotic cells via the gC1q domain. The collagen-like region binds to serine proteases
  such as C1r and C1s leading to activation of the classical pathway. Collagen region
  of C1q also binds to C1q receptors (most notably, cC1qR or calreticulin using CD91
  as a cell-surface adaptor) to augment phagocytosis by phagocytic cells and mount
  a pro-inflammatory immune response.
