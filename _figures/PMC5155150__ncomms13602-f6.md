caption: The four cornerstone conditions investigated in this study result in distinct
  progression of the hPSCs during exit of pluripotency. Depending on the level of
  CHIR (WNT pathway) stimulation and the BCD, primitive streak-like patterning along
  the anteroposterior axis occurs that ultimately determine cell fate into prospective
  definitive endoderm, cardiac mesoderm and PSM. WNT (CHIR) and BMP signalling act
  as main driver of PS progression over time, while cell-borne factors (LEFTY1 and
  CER1) antagonize the progression of the streak formation depending on the BCDs.
