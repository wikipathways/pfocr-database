caption: 'Simplified representation of the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins. Enzymes
  are indicated by bold text, intermediates are indicated by plain text, and gene
  locus designations are in italics. Enzymes are abbreviated as follows: 4-coumarate:
  CoA ligase (4CL), Anthocyanin Reductase (ANR), Chalcone Synthase (CHS, Inhibitor
  locus), Chalcone Isomerase (CHI), cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), Dihydroxyflavone
  Reductase (DFR), Flavanone 3-Hydroxylase (F3H, Wp), Flavonoid 5'' 3'' Hydroxylase
  (F3''5''H, W1), Flavonoid 3'' Hydroxylase (F3''H, Tawny) Leucoanthocyanidin Reductase
  (LAR), Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase (PAL). The chemical structures to the right of
  the pathway correspond to eriodictyol, dihydroquercetin, leucocyanidin, cyanidin,
  and cyanidin-3-glucoside (from top to bottom, respectively).'
