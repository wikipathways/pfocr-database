caption: (A) SMN involvement in regulation of actin dynamics. Rho-Associated Kinase
  (ROCK) phosphorylates Lim Kinase (LIMK) which in turn phosphorylates Cofilin (denoted
  by P in yellow circle) to contribute to actin dynamics regulation. SMN can prevent
  ROCK-mediated phosphorylation of Profilin2a (p2a) by interacting and forming a complex
  with p2a. When SMN is reduced, the interaction between p2a and ROCK increases, with
  a concomitant increase in p2a phosphorylation and a decrease in LIMK and Cofilin
  phosphorylation. Consequently, actin dynamics are deregulated and this leads to
  neurite outgrowth inhibition and neurodegeneration []. (B) SMN regulates the activation
  of c-Jun NH2-Terminal Kinases 3 (JNK3) by an unknown mechanism. When SMN is reduced,
  there is an increase in phosphorylation and thus activation of JNK3 and a subsequent
  increase in c-Jun phosphorylation. This increased activation can lead to neurodegeneration
  []. (C) SMN binds to and can regulate the level of Ubiquitin-Like Modifier Activating
  Enzyme 1 (UBA1; denoted by the dashed arrow). UBA1 can subsequently initiate the
  ubiquitination pathway that leads to degradation of target proteins. A reduction
  in UBA1 alters ubiquitin homeostasis and may lead to neurodegeneration [].
