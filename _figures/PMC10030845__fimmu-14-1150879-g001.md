caption: NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRC4, AIM2, and Pyrin can recruit procaspase-1 in an
  ASC-dependent manner, whereas NLRP1 and NLRC4 may also recruit procaspase-1 to the
  complex via CARD–CARD interactions. MAMPs and DAMPs are detected by TLR4, which
  induces the MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway to produce pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Activated
  caspase-1 promotes the maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 and cleaves GSDMD.
  The released active N-terminal domain of GSDMD causes membrane perforation and the
  release of the cell contents. LPS initiates pyroptosis via the noncanonical route
  by activating mouse caspase-4 and 5 or human caspase-11 to cleave GSDMD. The activated
  caspase-4, 5, and 11 cleave pannexin-1 and induce the release of ATP and K+, thereby
  activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. The efflux of K+ and ATP also activates P2X7,
  which forms a P2X7 pore in the cell membrane, promoting Ca2+ and Na+ influx. TWIK2
  mediates K+ efflux in coordination with P2X7 and thus initiates P2x7-related pyroptotic
  cell death.
