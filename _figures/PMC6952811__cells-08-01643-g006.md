caption: Illustration of cross-talk between the Hippo signaling and estrogen receptor
  mediated intracellular signaling. The Hippo signaling pathway includes a series
  of phosphorylation in STK3/4-LATS1/2-YAP axis. The signal of activation of STK3/4
  is unknown in endometrial epithelium. The activation of the non-genomic pathway
  of membrane-bound estrogen receptor might be involved in the activation of STK3/4.
  The MAP4K pathway is one of candidates to activate LATS1/2 via unknown signaling.
