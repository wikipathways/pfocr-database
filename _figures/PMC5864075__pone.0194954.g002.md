caption: (A) A schematic representation of the β-carotene biosynthetic pathway in
  Y. lipolytica. Integrated genes include geranyl diphosphate synthase (crtE), phytoene
  synthase (crtYB) and carotene desaturase (crtI). (B) Scheme for the construction
  of the β-carotene producing strain and the efficiency of targeted gene integration.
  The crtI, crtYB and crtE genes, driven by their individual 4UAS1B promoters, were
  integrated into the pox1, pox2 and pox3 sites in the ku70-disrupted Y. lipolytica
  strain, respectively. Cells treated with HU were transformed with the gene replacement
  cassette with 50 bp of homology arm to the target gene. The gene targeting rate
  (%) is shown, and the numbers in parentheses represent the correct integrants/total
  transformants screened. The experiments were performed in duplicate. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylgluratyl-coenzyme
  A; MVA, mevalonic acid; DMPAA, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; IPP, isopentyl pyrophosphate;
  PP, pyrophosphate.
