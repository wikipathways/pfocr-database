caption: Gene-level analysis of the serine biosynthesis, cysteine biosynthesis, and
  threonine biosynthesis pathways. The results of our study showed significant changes
  in the serine biosynthesis pathway (M00020) in cancer patients as compared with
  healthy individuals, cysteine biosynthesis pathway (M00338) in periodontitis patients,
  and the threonine biosynthesis pathway (M00018) in patients with complete tooth
  loss. Here, these pathways are shown on a gene level by visualizing the absolute
  difference in relative abundances of the genes (red color scheme), revealing that
  most genes from these pathways have been altered in their abundance between both
  conditions on a gene level. Additionally, we demonstrate that some of the genes
  from the threonine biosynthesis are either specific for Gram-negative (green) or
  Gram-negative/-positive bacteria (blue), while the serine and cysteine biosynthesis
  pathways consists of universal genes present in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
