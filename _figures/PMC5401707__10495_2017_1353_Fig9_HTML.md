caption: UA-induced and oxidative stress-mediated biphasic response in breast cancer
  cells. At lower concentrations (5 and 10 µM), UA promoted p21-mediated cell cycle
  arrest and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), whereas 20 µM UA caused AKT-mediated
  changes in glycolytic pathway leading to energy stress, cytotoxic autophagy and
  apoptosis in breast cancer cells. UA-induced apoptosis was accompanied by increased
  nitric oxide levels, pATM and pAMPK signals, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential
  and pERK1/2 signals
