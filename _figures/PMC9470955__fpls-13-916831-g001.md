caption: LEAFY COTYLEDONs connect different growth stages of plants and complete the
  generation cycle through epigenetic modification and mediating phytohormonal signaling.
  (A) LEAFY COTYLEDONs regulate the transition from embryogenesis to juvenile stage.
  PKL, PRC2, miRNA, and VAL1/VAL2 inhibit the expression of LEAFY COTYLEDONs to inhibit
  the GA signaling pathway. GA is antagonistic to ABA, and the expression of GA increases
  continuously, whereas ABA shows the opposite expression pattern during this stage.
  (B) LEAFY COTYLEDONs regulate the transition from juvenile to adult stage. There
  are potentially two pathways of how LEAFY COTYLEDONs regulate the transition from
  juvenile to adult stage. One is that FUS3 promotes VPC by recruiting chromatin repressors
  such as SWN and CLF for chromatin modification of miR156 to inhibit the expression
  of miR156 and then promote the expression of downstream SPLs. Another is that FUS3
  regulates VPC by participating in the ethylene signaling pathway, and there may
  be a cross-talk between these two pathways. (C) Perennials experience vernalization
  from juvenile to adulthood. VAL1/2 competes with LEAFY COTYLEDONs for binding to
  the FLC cold memory element CME, and VAL1/2 shuts down FLC expression by recruiting
  PRC2 and LHP1 for chromatin modification of FLC, as LEAFY COTYLEDONs shut down expression
  during this period. (D) Plants enter embryonic stage after fertilization. The LEAFY
  COTYLEDONs are expressed sequentially, and the plant enters a new life cycle by
  recruiting active chromatin modifiers such as FRI and EFS to activate the expression
  of FLC and a series of other genes such as miR156. VAL1/2 are suppressed during
  this period.
