caption: Biosynthetic pathway of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) in Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa. Anthranilate is activated by PqsA to form anthraniloyl-CoA, and this
  is condensed with β-keto-fatty acid to produce 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ).
  The condensation is postulated to be catalysed by PqsB, PqsC and PqsD. Alternatively,
  the intermediates in this pathway can be converted to HAQ-N-oxides by PqsL. HHQ
  is hydroxylated by PqsH to produce 2-heptyl-3,4-dihydroxyquinoline (PQS, Pseudomonas
  quinolone signal).
papertitle: HHQ and PQS, two Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing molecules, down-regulate
  the innate immune responses through the nuclear factor-κB pathway.
