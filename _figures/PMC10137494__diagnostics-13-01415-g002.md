caption: Steroid synthesis pathway. Steroid hormones are mostly synthesised in the
  adrenal cortex, with some sex steroid steps occurring in the gonads (not demonstrated
  here) from cholesterol. The small changes and multiple steps result in a wide range
  of structurally similar end hormones and precursors, which can cross-react with
  both assays and in vivo receptors. Created with Biorender.com [13,14,15].
