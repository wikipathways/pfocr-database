caption: a | The circadian nuclear receptor REV-ERBα is maximally expressed in mice
  at Zeitgeber time (ZT) 10, during the light period, and is nearly absent 12 hours
  later in the dark period (at ZT 22). REV-ERBα recruits histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)
  through the nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR) complex to its canonical DNA-binding
  motifs RevDR2 and ROR response element (RORE) to repress core circadian clock genes,.
  When REV-ERBα is not expressed, the nuclear receptor RAR-related orphan receptor
  (ROR) binds these motifs instead and recruits nuclear receptor co-activator 2 (NCoA2)
  and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) to activate gene transcription. In the depiction,
  ZT 0–12 is the light period and ZT 12–24 is the dark period. b | REV-ERBα tethered
  to hepatocyte nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) recruits HDAC3 through binding to the NCoR
  complex to mediate circadian repression of metabolic genes. In the absence of REV-ERBα
  during the dark period, the HATs p300, CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated
  factor (P/CAF; also known as KAT2B) acetylate nearby histones and promote metabolic
  gene expression. c | Prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1) forms a distinct co-repressor
  module at enhancers bound by HNF4α independently of REV-ERBα. PROX1 and HDAC3 are
  co-recruited to HNF4α-bound enhancers enriched with different C/EBP transcription
  factors. Ac, acetyl group; GPS2, G protein pathway suppressor 2; H3K27ac, acetylated
  histone H3 lysine 27; H3K9ac, acetylated histone H3 Lysine 9; TBL1X, transducin
  β-Like 1, X-Linked; TBL1XR1, TBL1-reLated protein 1; TF, transcription factor.
