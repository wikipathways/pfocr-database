caption: (Figure created using BioRender.com). NICD Notch intracellular domain, ADAM
  a disintegrin and metalloprotease, MAML mastermind-like. The Notch signaling pathway
  is where Notch precursors are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum after transcription
  and translation, translocated to the Golgi for S1 cleavage. The extracellular structural
  domains of the Notch receptor and ligand are then ubiquitinated by the ligand and
  initiate endocytosis for S2 cleavage. The Notch receptor then undergoes S3 cleavage
  by γ-secretase, a process that leads to the release of soluble NICD from Notch.
  Subsequently, NICD is degraded in the cytoplasm or translocated to the nucleus where
  it binds to the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jκ, which recruits Mastermind-like transcriptional
  co-activator 1 (MAML1) to form a multiprotein-DNA complex. This complex initiates
  Notch target genes
