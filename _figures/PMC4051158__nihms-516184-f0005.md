caption: The CD40-CD40L pathway plays a critical role in CD4 T-cell–mediated IL-21
  production during the rescue of exhausted T-cell response. (A) During chronic infections
  like toxoplasmosis, minimal IL-2 is produced by CD4 T cells in untreated animals.
  (B) Additionally these cells exhibit low levels of IL-21R and CD40 expression. Considering
  the low CD40 expression on CD4 T cells in untreated mice, it is not surprising that
  abrogation of CD40–CD40L signaling has, at best, a modest effect on CD4 T-cell–mediated
  IL-21 production or IL-21R expression. (C) Interestingly, αPD-L1 treatment not only
  augmented CD40 expression on CD4 T cells in chronically infected animals but also
  increased the expression of IL-21 and IL-21R on CD4 T cells. (D) However, in the
  absence of CD40–CD40L signaling, CD4 T cells in αPD-L1–treated animals failed to
  dramatically augment IL-21 or IL-21R, suggesting that the CD40–CD40L pathway plays
  a critical role in regulating IL-21 production and IL-21R expression on CD4 T cells
  in the context of T-cell rescue.
