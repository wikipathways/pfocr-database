caption: Tau alters kinesin-cargo interactions through modulation of a PP1-GSK3β signaling
  pathway. Tau contains a phosphatase-activating domain (PAD) within amino acids 2–18
  at the extreme N-terminus of tau (shown in red). Under normal conditions this epitope
  is obscured allowing for normal kinesin-based transport along the microtubules.
  In disease conditions tau can undergo a variety of modifications including aggregation
  or specific phosphorylation events that can aberrantly expose the PAD epitope. In
  the proposed model, these forms of tau can disrupt normal kinesin-based transport
  by activating protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). This in turn dephosphorylates an inhibitory
  phosphate on GSK3β in order to activate it. GSK3β then phosphorylates kinesin light
  chain inducing a release of cargo and disruption of FAT
