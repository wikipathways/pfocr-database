caption: Two pathways responsible for biosynthesis of flavones in Scutellaria baicalensis.
  The classic flavone pathway makes scutellarein in aerial tissues (left hand), while
  4′-deoxyRSFs are produced by a newly evolved pathway in roots (right hand). PAL,
  phenylalanine ammonialyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; CLL-7, cinnamate-CoA ligase;
  CLL-1, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase;
  FNSII, flavone synthase II; F6H, flavone 6-hydroxylase; F8H, flavone 8-hydroxylase;
  PFOMT, flavonoid O-methyltransferases; UBGAT, baicalein 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase.
