caption: Basic molecular changes underlying EMT. A, Signaling along canonical TGF-β
  pathway activates EMT-promoting transcription factor (such as Twist, ZEB or Snail)
  to repress transcription of E-cadherin that initially forms the adherens junction
  (AJ) complex together with β-catenin. Extinction of E-cadherin from the AJ complex
  as well as concomitant phosphorylation via activated growth factor receptors lead
  to cytoplasmic accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, where it acts
  as a transcription factor for migration-associated genes. B, Enhanced expression
  of Vimentin in migrating tumor cells protects phosphorylated MAPK from cytoplasmic
  phosphatases, thus ensuring signaling activity along the EGFR/MAPK axis. This supports
  pro-migratory effects on the cytoskeleton (such as Rac-mediated actin polymerization)
  and secretion of lytic matrix metalloproteinases that cleave the surrounding extracellular
  matrix to allow for cell migration.
