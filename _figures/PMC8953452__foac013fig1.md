caption: Upon osmostress, activated Hog1 orchestrates several cellular functions to
  coordinate the adaptive response and maximize cell survival. Once activated, Hog1
  controls mRNA biogenesis in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In the nucleus,
  Hog1 associates with stress-responsive loci to modulate transcription initiation
  and elongation. The cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 associates with phase-specific
  cyclins (shown around the central circle) to regulate passage through the cell cycle.
  Upon stress, Hog1 modulates progression at all phases of the cell cycle by acting
  on the indicated core elements of the cell cycle machinery. Hog1 also induces a
  cytoplasmic response that acts on glycerol and ion transporters, metabolism and
  translation.
