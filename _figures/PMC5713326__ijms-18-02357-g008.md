caption: Schematic diagram showing the mechanisms by which miR-1224-5p regulates silica-induced
  pulmonary fibrosis. miR-1224-5p targets BECN1, which lead to block PARK2 translocation
  to mitochondria and impairing mitophagy activity, then accumulating damaged mitochondria.
  Moreover, the PDGFRs signaling pathway activation mediated by insufficient mitophagy
  could promote myofibroblast differentiation.
