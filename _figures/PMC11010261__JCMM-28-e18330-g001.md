caption: 'Overview of the YAP/TAZ‐TEAD signalling axis. The core component of the
  Hippo pathway consists of the kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, which phosphorylate the
  YAP/TAZ complex. Once phosphorylated, YAP/TAZ interact with the 14‐3‐3 protein and
  undergo ubiquitin‐mediated proteasomal degradation. Unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocate
  to the nucleus, bind to TEAD1‐4 transcription factors and regulate the expression
  of target genes responsible for cell proliferation and inhibition of cell death.
  Several factors influence the Hippo pathway: (i) KIBRA‐NF2 and TAO activate MST1/2,
  while DLG5 and STRIPAK inhibit MST1/2. At low intracellular tension, RAP2 potentiates
  MAP4K, which, in turn, activates LATS1/2. (ii) GPCRs either activate or deactivate
  the YAP/TAZ complex, depending on the type of the GPCR. (iii) mechanotransduction
  also regulates YAP/TAZ activity. Integrins are connected to the ILK/FAK/Src pathway
  and potentiate YAP/TAZ through Rho GTPases and acto‐myosin. Ιnhibitors of the YAP/TAZ‐TEAD
  signalling cascade which are currently in phase I clinical trials are depicted in
  rectangulars. DLG5, discs large homologue 5; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GPCR, G
  protein‐coupled receptor; ILK, integrin‐linked kinase; KIBRA, kidney and brain protein;

  kinase kinase kinase; MOB1A/B, MOB kinase activator 1A/1B; MST1/2, STE20‐like protein
  kinase 1/2; NF2, neurofibromatosis type 2; RAP2, RAS‐related GTPase; STRIPAK, striatin‐interacting
