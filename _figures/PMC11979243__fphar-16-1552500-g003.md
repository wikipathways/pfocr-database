caption: Exosomes from different mesenchymal stem cells mediate apoptosis in brain
  cells after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell
  exosomes inhibit neuronal apoptosis by targeting the DAPK2/Akt signaling pathway
  through miR-133a-3p. They also promote Sirt1 deubiquitination, which alleviates
  inflammation damage induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury through the
  lncRNA KLF3-AS1/KLF3-AS1/miR-206/USP22 pathway. They downregulate FOXO1 through
  miR-145 to inhibit neuronal apoptosis and reduce neuroinflammatory damage via the
  miR-223-3P/CysLT2R pathway. Mesenchymal stem cells also inhibit neuronal apoptosis
  through the miR-150-5p/TLR5 signaling pathway and suppress neuronal pyroptosis via
  the miR-193b-5p/AIM2 pathway. Exosomes that originate from mesenchymal stem cells
  in human umbilical cord blood mitigate cerebrovascular damage through the modulation
  of the miR-320/KLF5 signaling pathway. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell exosomes
  exert neuroprotective effects by inhibiting ferroptosis through the miR-760-3p/CHAC1
  pathway
