caption: Subcellular localization of the MRH-containing proteins. Glucosidase II,
  XTP3-B, and OS-9 are resident, soluble ER proteins that recognize high mannose-type
  N-glycans, whereas GlcNAc-phosphotransferase is enriched in early Golgi compartments.
  The MPRs are relatively long-lived (half-life ~20 hrs) proteins that cycle continuously
  between the TGN, endosomal compartments, and the cell surface [], an itinerary that
  requires the recognition of specific motifs in their cytosolic tail by various cytosolic
  adaptor molecules (reviewed in [, ]). In early Golgi compartments, acquisition of
  the Man-6-P tag on newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes occurs in two steps (see
  text). The MPRs bind specifically to Man-6-P tagged acid hydrolases in the TGN,
  and the resulting receptor-enzyme complex is transported to endosomal compartments.
  Upon acidification of the late endosome, the MPRs dissociate from their cargo and
  traffic back to the TGN or to the cell surface, where the CI-MPR, but not the CD-MPR,
  can internalize various Man-6-P and non-Man-6-P containing ligands [, , ]. For simplicity,
  the MPRs are depicted as dimeric green balls in the cell. On the cell surface the
  CI-MPR is shown as a dimer consisting of 15 repeating grey balls with the three
  Man-6-P binding domains highlighted in green. The GlcNAc moiety of phosphodiesters
  on lysosomal enzymes is indicated by a red square.
