caption: The Yin-yang roles of mitophagy in obesity. PTEN-induced putative kinase
  1 (Pink1) deficiency activates nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing
  3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, leading to decreased uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression
  and diminishes energy expenditure. Pink1 deficiency also promotes mtDNA release
  and subsequent activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway in
  heart tissue, leading to exacerbated systematic inflammation, which may ultimately
  contribute to obesity. Conversely, ablation of Atg5/Atg12 inhibits mitophagy and
  restrains beige-to-white fat transition, revealing a negative role of mitophagy
  in energy consumption. Atg7 deficiency alleviates obesity by inhibiting adipogenesis.
