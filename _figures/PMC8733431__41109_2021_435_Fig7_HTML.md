caption: a Depicts the pathway constructed by hand from the selected papers (Jiang
  et al. ; Kong et al. ; Ke et al. ; Grass and Toole ; Xiong et al. ; Rucci et al.
  ; Ding et al. ; Ulrich and Pillat ; Wang et al. ; Kong et al. ; Kirk et al. ), with
  CD147(BSG) as the central node. b Shows the molecular mechanisms summarised in the
  knowledge network developed by NETME in accordance with the same papers used in
  a NETME shows that CD147 is a potent inducer of metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as
  MMP2, MMP14 and MMP9 as reported in Xiong et al. (); Rucci et al. (); Ding et al.
  (). Furthermore, the overexpression of CD147, which results in increased phosphorylation
  of PI3K(PIK3CA), Akt(AKT1), leads to the secretion of vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGFA) in several biological contexts such as KSHV infection Xiong et al.
  (); Rucci et al. (). In addition to its ability to induce MMPs, CD147 regulates
  spermatogenesis, lymphocyte reactivity and MCT system, in particular MCT1 and MCT4
  (MCTS1 and SLC16A4) expression (Xiong et al. ; Kirk et al. ). Our results also show
  that CD147 can increase the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter G2 (ABCG2)
  protein, regulating its function as a drug transporter, as mentioned by Xiong et
  al. for MCF-7 cells (Xiong et al. ). NETME identifies also BSG as an upstream activator
  of STAT3, highlighting its involvement in tumor development in agreement with the
  literature (Wang et al. ). As summarized by our knowledge network, CD147 is regulated
  by various inflammatory mediators, such as RANKL (TNFSF11), denoting its involvement
  in inflammatory processes (Grass and Toole ; Rucci et al. ). Among the potential
  activators of BSG, NETME also find the transcription factor c-Myc (MYC) (Kong et al.
  )
