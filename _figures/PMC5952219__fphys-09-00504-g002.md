caption: TLR4 signaling pathway. TLR4 activates two different pathways. Both of them
  share the co-factor (TIR)-domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP, also known as
  MAL). In myeloid factor 88 (Myd88)-dependent signaling pathway, Myd88 polymerizes
  with IL1-receptor-associated kinases (IRAK) 1 and 2, inducing the activation of
  TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). This activation boosts the signaling of
  different kinases like phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3 kinases (PI3K) and
  mitogen-activated- protein kinases (MAPKs), as well as the activation and transnucleation
  of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-κB). This leads to the production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and inflammatory mediators. Myd88-independent signaling pathway rather
  than recruit Myd88 it recruits TIR-domain-containing adapter protein inducing interferon-beta
  (TRIF) and TRIF-related adapter molecule (TRAM). The recruitment activates proteins
  like TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1), and secondarily, TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1). This elicits the
  transnucleation of interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and 7 transcription factors
  that leads to the production of different inflammatory factors like type I interferons.
