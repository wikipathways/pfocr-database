caption: The schematic was made by integrating the pathways of ko00945, ko00350, ko00360,
  ko00944, and ko00950. Each solid black arrow represents an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
  The dotted line means that the uncertain enzyme-catalyzed processes are included.
  The boxes with white backgrounds indicate that metabolites were not detected in
  this study. The boxes with color represent the metabolites whose content changed
  in response to MT treatment, the difference in metabolite content is expressed as
  the log2(fold change) value, and the normalized values are shown on a color scale.
  The asterisk represents a significant difference, and E means that inhibition of
  ethylene signaling by 1-MCP reduced the effects of MT on DAMs. The genes whose expression
  was upregulated or downregulated are highlighted with red or green colors, respectively.
