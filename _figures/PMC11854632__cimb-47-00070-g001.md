caption: 'Schematic representation of the effects of miR-21 on key signaling pathways
  involved in SCI, with a focus on axonal regeneration, apoptosis, and inflammation.
  MiR-21 regulates multiple pathways responding to SCI by targeting multiple components
  that influence cellular outcomes. The interaction between neurotrophic factors,
  e.g., BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) and their receptors tropomyosin receptor
  kinase B (TrkB) and P75 activate downstream signaling pathways, such as c-Jun N-terminal
  Kinase (JNK) and NF-ĸB, contributing to cell survival and regeneration. MiR-21 regulates
  axonal regeneration by promoting STAT3 phosphorylation and stimulating the expression
  of regeneration markers: Cyclin D1, Ki67, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP),
  and Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN). In parallel, miR-21 decreases apoptosis through the
  Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which downregulates pro-apoptotic
  factors, e.g., Casp-3 and Caspase-8 (Casp-8), and by the direct inhibition of PTEN
  and PDCD4, which provides neuronal protection and enhance survival. Inflammatory
  responses mediated by IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α are attenuated by miR-21 interacting
  with Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad7 signaling and suppressing NF-ĸB,
  thereby reducing inflammation. In addition, miR-21 modulates the FasL/Fas Receptor
  (FASR) axis and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to mitigate cell death further and promote
  neural repair. Red inhibitory arrows represent the direct inhibition by miR-21,
  black inhibitory arrows represent the indirect effect of miR-12 on the signaling
  pathway, and enhancing arrows indicate the regulatory effects of miR-21 on these
  pathways'
