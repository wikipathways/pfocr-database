caption: Canonical NF-κB pathway is central to intrinsic Notch1- and Notch3-modulated
  Treg cell function within tumor microenvironment. Two NF-κB negative regulators,
  A20 and CYLD, on removal of nonproteolytic K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from
  signaling molecules, interfere with the preTCR/TCR pathway, leading to NF-κB activation.
  For a pharmacological approach, pentoxifylline (PTXF) that selectively degrades
  c-Rel is indicated, as well as inhibitors of Treg-mediated suppression activity
  by CXCR4 antagonists, such as plerixafor (AMD3100) or peptide R-29. The dotted line
  refers to hypothetical Notch1- and/or Notch3-induced CXCR4 modulation in Treg cells,
  whereas the black curved-line indicates the Notch3-enhanced CTLA4 expression in
  N3-ICtg Tregs (). Cancer-associated cells once activated in a tumor microenvironment
  can express many proinflammatory genes, including stromal cell-derived factor 1
  (SDF1), the cognate ligand of CXCR4, partly in an NF-κB-dependent manner (). pTα-chain
  (preTCR) and T-cell receptor (TCR); IκBα, inhibitor of NF-κBα.
