caption: (a) Hh canonical pathway induced by recShh and SAG. Non-lipidated form of
  Hh (recShh) or SAG by binding to Ptch and Smo, respectively, inhibits 3T3-L1 adipogenesis
  in minimal induction medium through Smo activation leading to Gli factors transactivation,
  and adipocyte differentiation inhibition.(b) Hh non-canonical pathway induced by
  MPHh+ and GSA-10. MPHh+ (by binding to Ptch ?) trigger a potent inhibition of adipocyte
  conversion similar to the inhibitory effects of recShh or SAG, but molecular mechanisms
  differ and involve non-canonical Hh signalling. Smo agonist GSA-10 recapitulates
  the hallmarks of MPHh+-induced anti-adipogenic effects. Despite a Smo-dependency,
  MPHh+ and GSA-10 effects are independent of increased transcription of Gli1 factors.
  Conversely, MPHh+ and GSA-10 both rely on a Smo/Lkb1/Ampk axis to exert their anti-adipogenic
  effects, illustrating non-canonical Hh responses.
