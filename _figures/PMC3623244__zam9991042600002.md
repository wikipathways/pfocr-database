caption: The P. aeruginosa choline catabolic pathway and schematic representation
  of the loci encoding the associated catabolic enzymes. The colored arrows in the
  metabolic pathway correspond to the similarly colored arrows in the diagrams of
  the loci; a color match indicates the genes encoding required components of the
  catabolic enzyme. Similar, but lighter, colors indicate genes associated with the
  process that do not participate directly in catabolism or whose exact function is
  unknown. The indicated identities of the reactants and products of GbcAB-dependent
  demethylation are not known (hence the question mark) but are based on predictions
  of homologous monooxygenases. For transcriptional control, BetI is a repressor whose
  repression of the betI and betT1 promoters is released by binding choline; i.e.,
  choline represses the BetI repressor function. GbdR is an activator that induces
  transcription from the gbcA, gbcB, PA5396, and glyA1 promoters in response to sensing
  GB and dimethylglycine (DMG). The soxA gene is labeled, and the other genes coding
  for the SoxBDAG heterotetrameric sarcosine demethylase are noted only by the corresponding
  letters.
