caption: Précis of signaling pathways involved in glioma and inhibition by mTOR, AKT,
  PI3K and ERK inhibitors and genetic configuration of TSC1 and TSC2. Continuous lines
  with arrow end exhibits activation and with blunt end exhibits inhibition. Growth
  factors up on binding to transmembrane receptors result in PI3Kinase activity which
  elevates PIP3 levels, thus activating AKT leading to anti-apoptotic/pro-cell proliferation
  effects. It has been also reported that HSP90 also phosphorylates AKT. AKT and /or
  ERK upon activation inhibits TSC1/TSC2 complex. But PTEN negatively regulates AKT.
  The C terminal GAP of tuberin inhibits Rheb (G protein, an activator of mTORC1)
  leading to increase in levels of ribosomal S6-kinase and phosphorylated ribosomal
  S6. Drugs potently inhibiting at different level of the signaling pathway has been
  also presented, respectively. The TSC1 gene comprises of 23 exons, 1164 amino acids
  (aa) with 130 kDa molecular mass and interacts with TSC2 in the region of 302–430
  aa. It has coiled-coil (CC, aa 719–998) and potential transmembrane (TM, aa 127–144)
  domains at the N- and C-terminal regions. The TSC2 gene comprises of 41 exons, 1807
  aa with 200 kDa molecular mass and interacts with TSC1 in the region of 1-418 aa.
  The gene also consists of two coiled-coils (CC, aa 346–371 and aa 1008–1021), a
  leucine zipper (LZ, aa 75–107), a Rheb-GAP (aa 1517–1674) and a calmodulin-binding
  (CAM, aa 1740–1758) domain. The N-terminal CC domain is essential for its association
  with TSC1. At specific aa residues the activity of TSC1 and TSC2 is synchronized
  by both inhibitory and activating phosphorylation events. In TSC1, the presence
  of glycogen synthase 3 beta (GSK3B) sites Thr357 and Thr390 activates and presence
  of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK1) sites Thr417, Ser584, and Thr1047 inhibits TSC1-TSC2
  complex activity. In TSC2, the presence of AMP kinase (AMPK) sites Thr1227 and Ser1345
  activates and presence of extracellular-related kinase (ERK2) sites Ser664; AKT/protein
  kinase B (PKB) sites Ser939, Ser981, Thr1462; mitogen-activated protein kinase-
  activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) site Ser1210 and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1)
  site Ser1798 inhibits TSC1-TSC2 complex activity.
