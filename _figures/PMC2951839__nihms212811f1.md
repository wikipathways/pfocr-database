caption: 'Glucose-derived carbon can be converted by SCOT into acetoacetate that is
  exported from the mitochondria to the cytosol and, ultimately, converted into short
  chain acyl-CoAs in the cytosol (thick arrows). Succinate formed in the SCOT reaction
  is regenerated by either the GTP or the ATP succinyl-CoA transferase. In the presence
  of the experimental insulin secretagogue combination of β-hydroxybutyrate and monomethyl
  succinate, HB-derived carbon can be converted into acetoacetate to supply the same
  pathways or into acetoacetyl-CoA by SCOT and ultimately into acetyl-CoA for consumption
  in the citric acid cycle (dashed arrows). Succinate and succinyl-CoA derived from
  the citric acid cycle and/or from exogenous methyl succinate can feed the SCOT reaction.
  The pathway involving ATP citrate lyase is also shown. Abbreviations: AACS, acetoacetyl-CoA
  synthetase; ACAT1 or ACAT2, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 or 2; ACAA1 or ACCA2,
  acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1 or 2.'
