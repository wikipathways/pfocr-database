caption: Impact of placental insufficiency on endocrine responsiveness in fetal myoblasts
  and myofibers. Adrenergic activity increases due to greater circulating catecholamines.
  Adrenergic receptor β subtype-specific desensitization results in a greater proportion
  of signaling through Adrβ1 and Adrβ3 because Adrβ2 expression is reduced. Insulin
  signaling is reduced due to adrenergic suppression of insulin secretion in pancreatic
  β-cells and by muscle adrenergic signaling that negatively influences the insulin-Akt2
  intercellular signaling pathway. These developmental adaptations reduce rates of
  myoblast proliferation and differentiation as well as glucose metabolism in skeletal
  muscle.
