caption: Mechanisms of AIM2 regulation in CRC, HCC, and RCC in inflammasome-independent
  manner. In CRC, AIM2 demonstrates the ability to modulate tumor stem cell activity
  through the regulation of CIITA expression, resulting in the induction of HLA-DRA/HLA-DRB
  and suppression of the Wnt signaling pathway. Additionally, AIM2 exerts an inhibitory
  effect on CRC cell viability by targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to cell
  cycle arrest at the G1 and G2/M phases and a decrease in the S phase population,
  ultimately promoting apoptosis. Furthermore, AIM2 exhibits a suppressive impact
  on CRC progression by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR and Glil pathways, consequently diminishing
  the proliferation and migration of CRC cells. In HCC, AIM2 facilitates cancer cell
  apoptosis through the suppression of the Notch signaling pathway, resulting in decreased
  cancer cell migration and invasion, ultimately impeding the progression of HCC.
  Moreover, AIM2 promotes the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of FOXO3a,
  thereby inhibiting ferroptosis and promoting the progression of RCC
