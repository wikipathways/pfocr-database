caption: 'Macrophages in the progression of CP to PC: M2 macrophages interact with
  PSCs and contribute to the fibrotic process in the pancreas. At the same time, M1
  macrophages release cytotoxins such as ROS, which promote genetic instability. M1
  macrophages also release pro-inflammatory factors such as EGF, TNF-α, and IL-6,
  which bind to the corresponding receptors on the cell surface and activate multiple
  downstream oncogenic signaling pathways. Ultimately, CP cells exhibit proliferation,
  anti-apoptosis, inflammatory response, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT),
  and stem cell properties, completing its transformation into an invasive PC'
