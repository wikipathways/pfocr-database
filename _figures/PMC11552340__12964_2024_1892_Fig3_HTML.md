caption: Compounds that target components of WNT pathway. Schematic representation
  of the β-catenin-dependent WNT signaling pathway alongside pharmaceutical modulators.
  These are strategically designed to inhibit WNT pathway activity, acting at various
  stages, including inhibition of WNT ligand maturation and secretion, of WNT ligand-receptor
  complex interactions, and of key molecular players within the β-catenin-dependent
  intracellular WNT signaling cascade. These include small molecule inhibitors, peptide
  antagonists, and monoclonal antibodies
