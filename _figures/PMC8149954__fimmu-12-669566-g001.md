caption: Cellular pathways whereby iron shapes macrophage polarization. Iron deprivation
  may suppress NF-κB activation to block M1-like macrophage polarization (A). In some
  special cases, iron deprivation could lower the activity of Nox to promote p65 nuclear
  translocation and increases NF-κB activity, promoting M1-like macrophage polarization
  (B). Iron treatment could activate MAPK-p-MK2 pathway to increase TNF-α production
  to generate a large amount of OH• and ONOO•, promoting M1-like macrophage polarization
  (C). Acute iron deprivation inhibits ATF4 expression to suppress M2-like macrophage
  polarization in tumorous tissues (D). Iron treatment may promote M1-like macrophage
  polarization by inducing the activation of MAPK, NF-κB and other proinflammatory
  signaling pathways via increasing the production of intracellular ROS (E). Iron
  overload increases hepcidin expression which can inhibit STAT6 activation while
  promote IRF3 expression to increase iNOS expression in M1-like macrophages (F).
  Iron can activate NLRP3 inflammasome to promote M1-like macrophage polarization
  by the generation of ROS (G). Iron might enhance M2-like macrophage polarization
  through moderately activating of mtROS cascading with NF-κB pathway by down-regulating
  GMFG level (H). ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; GMFG, glia maturation factor-γ;
