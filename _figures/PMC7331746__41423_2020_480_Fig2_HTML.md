caption: The essential role of mitochondrial dynamics in T cells. a Mitochondrial
  dynamics are involved in metabolic programming to control T cell fate. Memory T
  cells (Tm) undergo increased fusion to promote catabolic metabolism, while effector
  T cells (Te) undergo increased fission to increase anabolic metabolism. Increasing
  mitochondrial fusion regulated by OPA1 could convert Te cells to the Tm phenotype.
  b Mitochondria underwent fission and transport and formed a ring-like structure
  near the immune synapse (IS) during the formation and activity of the IS in T cells.
  c After stimulation with anti-CD3 antibodies, mitochondrial fission induced by the
  accumulation of DRP1 in mitochondria promoted the production of IL-2 and activation-induced
  cell death via the ROS-NF-κB pathway in T cells. d The reduction of MFN2 or MIGA2
  was observed in electric shock (ES)-treated mice, which promoted mitochondrial fission
  and enhanced the synthesis of xanthine via IRF1 accumulation. These processes are
  significantly associated with the onset of anxiety-like behaviors in mice
