caption: 'To establish drug assessment platform for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), three
  steps were performed: (i) Generation of iPSC-derived organoids (iCOs) both from
  normal and sporadic AD (sAD) participants, and CRISPR-Cas9 ApoE4 isogenic lines
  were used. (ii) Systems biology-based AD pathway simulation; Signaling network construction,
  network model validation, and identification of control nodes steps were conducted.
  (iii) Validation of drugs from the simulation; FDA-approved drugs were used, and
  the degree of AD pathogenesis was quantified by the high-contents screening (HCS)
  imaging system. Approximately, 1300 organoids from 11 participants were used for
  the drug assessment platform. PiB Pittsburgh compound B, ApoE apolipoprotein E,
  ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Aβ beta-amyloid, p-tau phosphorylated tau.'
