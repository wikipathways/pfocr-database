caption: Generalized pathway diagram of sucrose metabolism in the sugarcane sink.
  Sucrose accumulation during maturation in the culm is characterized by a decrease
  in two substrate cycles, namely triose phosphate hexose phosphate- and sucrose cycling.
  The common intermediate in these two cycles, the hexose phosphate pool (fructose-6-P,
  glucose-6-P, glucose-1-P and UDP-glucose) also serves as substrate for, among others,
  sucrose synthesis. PFP may contribute to the status of the hexose phosphate pool
  in sink tissue by regulating the carbon flux between sucrose accumulation and respiration.
  Due to negligible FBPase activity reported in sugarcane internodes, it also appears
  that only PFP can regulate gluconeogenic carbon flux in sugarcane sink metabolism
  (adapted from Krook et al. )
