caption: DEG-enrichment of the plant hormone signal transduction pathway by KEGG annotation.
  The key regulatory components in multiple hormone response pathways are presented
  as their names (red, up-regulated; green, down-regulated). Gene IDs and fold changes
  in transcript abundance are indicated in Additional file
papertitle: Integrated mRNA and microRNA transcriptome variations in the multi-tepal
  mutant provide insights into the floral patterning of the orchid Cymbidium goeringii.
