caption: Overview of wound repair and fibrosis. Epithelial and/or endothelial damage
  caused by various insults triggers complex interconnected wound-healing programs
  to quickly restore homeostasis. The coagulation pathway, which functions to stem
  blood loss, is triggered first, followed by acute inflammation and activation of
  innate immune mediators such as resident macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic
  cells. Epithelial and innate immune cell–derived cytokines subsequently influence
  the activation of the adaptive immune response. The tissue damage can also directly
  activate the adaptive immune response. Inflammatory and immune mediators (cytokines,
  chemokines and free radicals) attempt to eliminate the inciting factor while activating
  the resident quiescent fibroblasts into myofibroblasts that orchestrate angiogenesis
  and production of ECM components. Failure to adequately contain or eliminate the
  inciting factors can exacerbate the inflammatory response and lead to a chronic
  wound-healing response, with continued tissue damage, repair and regeneration, ultimately
  resulting in fibrosis. TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin; Ab, antibody; PMN, polymorphonuclear
  leukocyte; EOS, eosinophil; Baso, basophil; Mast, mast cell.
