caption: Cascades of the coagulation system. (a) Resting ECs provide natural anticoagulants
  (TM, AT and TFPI and ADPase) to inhibit coagulation and keep platelet activation
  and the coagulation cascade in check. (b) Coagulation is typically initiated by
  an injury to the vascular ECs, which results in the exposure of TF and collagen
  from the sub-endothelial tissue to the blood and the release of vWF. (c) Platelets
  are activated when they are exposed to TF, collagen and vWF. Activated platelets
  release a number of mediators, such as ADP and vWF stores within their granules,
  leading to further platelet recruitment, activation, aggregation and plug formation,
  which is a process termed primary hemostasis. (d) The interaction between TF and
  factor VII initiates the extrinsic pathway. (e) The exposure of collagen to blood
  starts the intrinsic pathway. (f) Both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways result
  in the initiation of a common pathway, which contains the cascades involved in the
  production of activated Factor X and thrombin and the formation of fibrin strands.
  (g) Fibrin strands strengthen the platelet plug and lead to the formation of a stable
  platelet–fibrin clot. This process is termed secondary hemostasis. (h) Kallikrein,
  uPA or tPA activate plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades and reabsorbs the
  polymerized fibrin strands. It is the eventual process of fibrinolysis that heals
  wounds. AT, antithrombin; ECs, endothelial cells; TF, tissue factor; TFPI, tissue
  factor pathway inhibitors; TM, thrombomodulin; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator;
  uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator; vWF, von Willebrand factor.
