caption: 'Working models for the failure of PRL-PRLR-JAK2-STAT5 signaling to activate
  proliferation in adult human β-cells. A: In non-β-cells, such as mammary epithelium
  or lymphocytes, PRL binds to the hPRLR, activating JAK2, which recruits and phosphorylates
  (P) STAT5, which then dimerizes and transits to the nucleus, where it binds to promoters
  of genes associated with proliferation, such as cyclins and cdks. In some cell types
  JAK2-STAT5 activation may also recruit signaling molecules that activate signaling
  in the PI3K/Akt/PKB pathway or the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway, which may contribute to
  proliferation. B: In the normal adult β-cell, the hPRLR is absent. Therefore, PRL
  fails to activate JAK2-STAT5 signaling, nuclear trafficking, or proliferation. C:
  Adenoviral expression of high levels of mouse Stat5a bypasses the absent hPRLR,
  leads to Stat5 phosphorylation by undefined kinases, activates all three d-cyclins
  and cdk4, permits their nuclear translocation, and results in proliferation. It
  is possible, but unknown, whether overexpression of Stat5 may influence PI3K/Akt/PKB
  or MAPK signaling in human islets or whether it alters restrictive DNA or histone
  modifications such as methylation (Me) or acetylation (Ac) that may prevent replication.
  D: Reconstitution of functional hPRLR on human β-cells restores JAK2-STAT5 phosphorylation
  and STAT5A nuclear translocation but still fails to activate proliferation. This
  could result from unknown irreversible epigenetic changes, increases in suppressors
  of cytokine signaling (e.g., CISH), increases in CDKIs (e.g., p18/CDKN2C), or other
  unknown mechanisms in adult human β-cells. See text for details.'
