caption: The model depicts the role of the NF-κB-YY1-miR-1 regulatory circuit in myogenic
  differentiation. This circuit involves the constitutive activity of NF-κB in myoblasts
  that regulates YY1 expression which subsequently suppresses miR-1 expression epigenetically
  and maintains cells in an undifferentiated state. As differentiation is initiated,
  the down-regulation of the NF-κB-YY1 pathway leads to concomitant up-regulation
  of miR-1 that in turns further decreases YY1 as well as Pax7 levels to ensure proper
  differentiation into myotubes. (B) Network visualization depicting YY1-centered
  circuitry drawn by Cytoscape. Findings from the current studies demonstrate a repression
  of miR-1, miR-133 and miR-206 by YY1. Together with previous findings, these interactions
  constitute an YY1-miRNA regulatory network. YY1, Yellow octagon; miRNAs, red diamonds;
  Experimentally validated miRNA targets, grey circles; red blunted arrows, transcriptional
  repression; black blunted arrows, post-transcriptional repression.
