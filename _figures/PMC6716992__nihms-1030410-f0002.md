caption: 'Exposure to DNRAb mediates immediate excitotoxic death of some neurons (acute
  stage). The surviving neurons experience strong NMDAR stimulation that induces HMGB1
  secretion. Microglia are activated following DNRAb penetration of the BBB. There
  are at least three possible mechanisms for microglial activation in the DNRAb model:
  binding of secreted HMGB1 to receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)
  or toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), engagement of activating Fc receptors (FcR) by DNRAb-immune
  complexes, and/or exposure to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from
  apoptotic neurons. Activated microglia contribute to the loss of dendrites and synapses,
  which are “tagged” for destruction by a NMDAR-HMGB1-C1q complex (chronic stage).
  Interferon-alpha (IFNα) penetrates the BBB, or is produced centrally, and activates
  microglia, resulting in the loss of neuronal dendrites and synapses. Another mechanism
  of IFNα-induced neurotoxicity may be through stimulation of the KYN/TRP metabolic
  pathway in microglia, causing excessive production of QA that results in neuronal
  excitotoxicity.'
