caption: Intracellular life cycle of dengue virus. DENV binds (step 1) and enters
  (step 2) cells via an uncharacterized receptor(s) by RME. Endosomal acidification
  (step 3) results in an irreversible trimerization of the viral E protein, exposing
  the fusion domain. After being uncoated, the vRNA is translated (step 4) at ER-derived
  membranes, where it is processed into three structural and seven NS proteins. After
  the viral replication complex is synthesized, vRNA translation switches off and
  RNA synthesis (step 5) begins. Subsequently, successive rounds of translation (step
  6) are followed by assembly in the ER. The virion is maturated in the Golgi compartment
  (step 7) and exits via the host secretory pathway. Viral proteins C, E, NS3, and
  NS5 have been observed in the nuclei of infected cells (, , , , ), and the vRNA
  associates specifically with a number of cellular proteins (, , , ); however, the
  biological significance is unknown. L-SIGN, liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing
  nonintegrin; PTB, polypyrimidine tract binding protein; EF-1α, elongation factor
  1α; hnRNP L, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase.
