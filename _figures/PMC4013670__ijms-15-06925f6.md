caption: Schematic describing the proposed anti-inflammatory response resulting from
  resveratrol treatment and its effects on TLR4 following stimulation of chondrocytes
  with IL-1β. IL-1β-upregulated TLR4 expression results in the activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB
  signaling pathway causing translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus resulting in the
  production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNFα. Resveratrol-mediated
  directly inhibition of TLR4 expression could block the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling
  pathway (a1, dashed line), or resveratrol could affect TLR4 pathway processes in
  the nucleus through unknown regulatory mechanisms that regulate the gene expression
  (a2, dashed line); Direct inhibition of NF-κB by resveratrol, as described by Csaki
  [] and Shakibaei [] is shown in (b, solid line); Mechanisms involved in NF-κB suppression
  by resveratrol-activated SIRT1, as described by Lei [] are shown in (c, solid line).
