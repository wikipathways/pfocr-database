caption: Schematic representation of the HHV-6A replication cycle. A diagram of the
  proposed replication cycle for HHV-6A is shown. HHV-6A gH/gL/gQ1/gQ2 binds to CD46
  (1) and enters the cell via endocytosis (2). The deenveloped nucleocapsid is then
  transported to the nucleus (3, 4), where the viral genome is released (5). After
  viral gene transcription and genome replication (6), the progeny DNA is encapsidated
  (7), and the capsid buds into the perinuclear cisternae (8). The capsid acquires
  a primary envelope in the perinuclear space (9), and deenvelopment occurs in the
  cytoplasm (10). The nucleocapsid acquires the final envelope by budding into TGN-
  or post-TGN-derived membrane (11). Vacuoles containing virions expand and form MVBs
  (12), then the mature enveloped virions are released via the exosomal pathway (13).
