caption: Disturbed flow (d-flow), EndMT, and plaque stability in atherosclerosis.
  (A) d-flow that occurs at the lesser curvature of the aortic arch is atherogenic,
  whereas stable flow typically presents in the descending aorta is atheroprotective
  (EndICLT). (B) The mechanosensor Piezo1 is crucial to the differential responses
  to these hemodynamic profiles. In response to d-flow, Piezo1 activates the NF-κB
  pathway, which is known to be important to inflammation-mediated EndMT. In addition
  to EndMT, d-flow also activates of endothelial-to-immune-cell-like transition. The
  mechanosensor Alk5 and associated protein Shc have been directly linked to activation
  of Smad-2 mediated EndMT pathways in response to d-flow in atherosclerosis. (C)
  EndMT can contribute to both plaque instability and plaque stability depending on
  whether EndMT results in transition of ECs to fibroblast-like cell types with increased
  matrix metalloproteinase expression or to myofibroblasts.
