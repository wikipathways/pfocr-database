caption: A proposed network of phytohormones for Si-mediated potato late blight resistance.
  Foliar spraying Si triggers the early ET accumulation in potato leaves. It induces
  the expression of JA synthesis-related genes to increase the levels of JA and JA-Ile
  and to suppress the level of SA. However, Si-mediated resistance is required for
  JA accumulation and independent on JA signaling pathway. Moreover, independent on
  SA signaling pathway, Si specifically activates StNPR1 induce the expression of
  NPR1-dependent PR genes to mediate the resistance against P. infestans.
