caption: The MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK1 signaling pathway induces the formation of hybrid ubiquitin
  chains containing both Lys63 (K63)-linked and Met1 (M1)-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains.
  ABIN1 and its binding partner A20 interact with these ubiquitin chains, restricting
  the activation of TAK1 and IKKβ. The ABIN1[D485N] mutation prevents interaction
  with ubiquitin chains causing hyperactivation of TAK1 and IKKβ and the overproduction
  of inflammatory mediators. The overproduction of IL-6 drives the formation of GCB
  cells, autoantibodies, and glomerulonephritis, but not the autoinflammatory aspects
  of the disease phenotype, which include the liver pathology. The liver pathology
  is driven by one or more myeloid cells independently of the adaptive immune system.
  The MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK1 signaling axis also drives increased formation of atypical
  patrolling and inflammatory monocytes (pMo, iMo) in ABIN1[D485N] mice which may
  contribute to the liver pathology, as well as IL-6 production and glomerulonephritis.
  The activation of TLR7 drives autoimmunity in ABIN1[D485N] mice, but additional
  TLRs contribute to other aspects of the disease phenotype. The IRAK4 inhibitor,
  PF06426779, suppresses both the autoimmune and autoinflammatory aspects of the disease
  phenotype of ABIN1[D485N] mice. Polymorphisms in TLR7, IRAK1, ABIN1, and A20 predispose
  to human lupus. The genes encoding TLR7 and IRAK1 are X-linked and may account,
  at least in part, for the prevalence of lupus in women.
