caption: Glucose and glutamine dependency in SLC7A11high cancers. Glutamine is the
  major precursor for glutamate. Glucose is the main supplier of 1) carbon for the
  TCA cycle and 2) NADPH for GSH production. Under normal conditions (green circle)
  SLC7A11high cells exchange higher amounts of glutamate with cystine. Large amounts
  of imported cystine are converted to cysteine for GSH production and ROS detoxification.
  However, higher export of glutamate leaves cells more dependent on glucose and/or
  glutamine to feed the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation/mitochondrial respiration.
  Under glucose deprived conditions (red circle-right half), SLC7A11high cells lack
  the required levels of carbon. Higher cystine import via SLC7A11 leads to higher
  GSH synthesis and a glucose-deficiency induced depletion in NADPH. This results
  in ROS induction and enhanced cell death. Under glutamine deprived conditions (red
  circle-left half) in SLC7A11high cells, higher glutamate export results in depletion
  of intracellular glutamate which feeds into the TCA cycle. This drives enhanced
  import of glutamine and glutaminase activity to synthesize glutamate, resulting
  in glutamine dependency. Therefore, under glutamine starvation conditions, intracellular
  glutamate is inadequate to fuel the TCA cycle, leading to growth arrest. ROS, Reactive
