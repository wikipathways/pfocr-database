caption: The 98 proteins that showed significant changes in oxidation levels with
  HFHS diet were subjected to IPA. Tricarboxylic acid cycle II eukaryotic (P=2.11E-13)
  and mitochondrial dysfunction (P=3.06E-11) ranked as the top 2 canonical pathways.
  A lined pattern indicates a ≥1.5-fold increase in reversible oxidation by HFHS diet
  at the highest fold-change cysteine in a particular protein. A checkered pattern
  indicates a decrease in reversible oxidation by ≥1.5-fold by HFHS diet. Proteins
  with open symbols (no fill) were detected, but did not significantly change due
  to HFHS diet. A) Differentially oxidized proteins in the TCA cycle. B) Oxidative
  changes in the ETC, extracted from the IPA mitochondrial dysfunction pathway. All
  proteins presented in complex 1 are Nduf components. Solid arrowhead indicates reaction;
  diamond head indicates enzyme catalysis. Atp5h, ATP synthase subunit d, mitochondrial;
  Cox6b1, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6B1; Cyc1, cytochrome c1, heme protein, mitochondrial;
  NDUF, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); Sdha-c, succinate dehydrogenase; Uqcrc/h,
  ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase core/hinge.
