caption: A schematic model of SP-mediated inhibition of ASIC3 signaling. When tissue
  acidosis occurs in muscle, protons depolarize the muscle afferents by activating
  ASIC3 channels and fire APs, which can trigger the release of SP in the nerve terminals.
  SP acts on the NK1 receptor in the local nerve terminals. The NK1 receptors on muscle
  afferents are coupled with an unconventional signal pathway by activating tyrosine
  kinase and M channels to inhibit the ASIC3-mediated neural firing.
