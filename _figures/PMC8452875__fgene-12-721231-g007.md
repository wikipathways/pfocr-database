caption: Clock-controlled checkpoints in the placenta. Placental inflammation and
  trophoblastic hypoxia are promoted by the CLOCK-HIF-1α signaling pathway during
  the active phase and suppressed through the melatonin-superoxide dismutase (SOD)-catalase
  (CAT) signaling pathway during the rest phase. However, the exact relationship between
  circadian genes and melatonin remains unclear. Melatonin can also elevate plasma
  insulin and subsequently increase fatty acid biosynthesis in the placenta.
