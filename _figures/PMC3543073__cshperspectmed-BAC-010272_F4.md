caption: Bacterial nucleomodulins targeting chromatin. Schematic representation of
  Chlamydia, Anaplasma, Listeria, and Shigella secreted factors involved in the control
  of gene expression in the nucleus of host cells, as detailed in the text. The bacterial
  nucleomodulins are in yellow. 1. Chlamydia histone-methyltransferase NUE methylate’s
  mammalian histones. However, target genes are unknown. 2. Binding to AT-rich sequences
  and silencing of CYBB expression by Anaplasma Ank effector AnkA. 3. Inhibition of
  the BAHD1-associated heterochromatic complex and induction of interferon-stimulated
  genes by Listeria LntA. On Listeria infection, an unknown signaling pathway drives
  the BAHD1-associated chromatin complex (see C) to repress interferon-stimulated
  genes. When Listeria produces and secretes LntA, this factor enters the nucleus
  and interacts with BAHD1, destabilizes the silencing complex, restores histone acetylation
  (Ac), and enhances the expression of ISGs. 4. Control of a set of NF-κB (p65-p50)
  regulated genes by Shigella posttranslational modifiers OspF, which eliminylates
  MAP kinases preventing phosphorylation of histone H3, and IpaH9.8, which ubiquitinylates
  and promotes degradation of the splicing factor U2AF35. OspF and another effector,
  OspB, bind the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which potentially recruits several chromatin-remodeling
  enzymes (not shown). Ac, Acetylation; Me, methylation; P, phosphorylation; E, eliminylation;
  UB, ubiquitinylation.
