caption: Mitochondria is a vital organelle of the cell involved in the maintenance
  and survival of the cell. Thus, ODE induced mitochondrial damage can have different
  consequences simultaneously. 1) Cytochrome c is a respiratory chain protein loosely
  associated with the inner membrane of mitochondria. ODE exposure induced mitochondrial
  damage will result in the release of Cytochrome c into the cellular cytosol and
  initiation of apoptotic changes inside the cell through activation of Caspase 3
  and Caspase 9. 2) Mitochondrial fusion (MFN1/2 mediated) is a form of stress response
  and is a mechanism for coping with the altered cellular homeostasis. 3) TFAM is
  a mitochondrial DNA binding protein that aids in the transcription of the mitochondria
  genome. Damage to mitochondria renders TFAM and mt-DNA vulnerable for release into
  the cellular cytosol. When in the cytosol, mt-DNA can potentiate an inflammation
  response through TLR9-NFκB signaling resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine release
  or mt-DNA can be sensed by cGAS-STING pathway, ultimately leading to IFN-β production.
  4) PINK1 mediated mitophagy is a response often seen in damaged or stressed mitochondria
  to contain the inflammation. During mitophagy, mitochondria undergo selective degradation
  to maintain cellular homeostasis. 5) Finally, by targeting mitochondria and preventing
  it from experiencing damage or stress can help alleviate the inflammation. Use of
  MA (C2 or C11) reduced mitochondrial fusion, prevented mt-DNA release, downregulated
  pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as prevented microglial activation and cellular
  apoptosis. Selective STING DsiRNA knockdown also helped in reducing microglial activation.
  Both MA (C2 or C211) and STING knockdown downregulated the ODE induced inflammatory
  and apoptotic markers and promoted the resolution of inflammation.
