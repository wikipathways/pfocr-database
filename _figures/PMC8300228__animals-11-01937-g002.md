caption: The immune-induced signaling pathway of insect antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).
  The Toll signaling pathway is activated by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, and
  the immune deficiency (IMD) signaling pathway is activated by Gram-negative bacteria
  and fungi. These two signaling pathways act independently and AMP production is
  induced by transport of a series of necessary proteins into the nucleus.
