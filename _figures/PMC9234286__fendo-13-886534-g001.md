caption: Metabolic regulation of RhoA/ROCK pathway in thermogenesis, energy balance,
  obesity prevention and insulin sensitivity. Adipose RhoA/ROCK activation, caused
  by metabolic stresses including hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and ROS, is associated
  with disease phenotypes. Total ROCK activity and ROCK2 activity are negative regulators
  of thermogenic, adipogenic, and mitochondrial gene expression via stimulation of
  F-actin/MRTF/SRF signaling pathway and inhibition of insulin signaling pathway.
  Hepatic RhoA/ROCK activation by risk-factors is also associated with aberrant regulation.
  Total ROCK activity and ROCK1 activity are positive regulators of lipogenic pathway
  through inhibition of AMPK and activation of SREBP1c. Hepatic RhoA/ROCK activities
  are also negative regulators of thermogenesis and insulin signaling pathway. Skeletal
  muscle RhoA/ROCK activation shows both beneficial and detrimental outcomes. ROCK
  activation under basal or exercise condition is critical to glucose regulation via
  promoting insulin signaling pathway. Conversely, ROCK activation by metabolic stresses
  is associated with disease through inhibition of AMPK and insulin signaling. Hypothalamic
  RhoA/ROCK1 activation by circulating leptin decreases body weight and adiposity
  through reducing food intake, increasing energy expenditure and locomotor activity
  (Green texts indicate beneficial effects in metabolism; red texts indicate detrimental
  effects in metabolism) (Figure is created with BioRender.com).
