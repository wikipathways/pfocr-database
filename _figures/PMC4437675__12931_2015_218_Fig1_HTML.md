caption: Periostin is involved in the pathogenic process of eosinophils and Th2-type
  asthma. Briefly, allergens induce the secretion of IL-4 and IL-13 from certain immune
  cells, thereby stimulating eosinophils cells to produce periostin. Periostin, in
  turn through an autocrine pathway (indicated by the green colored receptors), acts
  on eosinophils to stimulate the adhesion of purified human blood eosinophils, while
  also enhancing their recruitment to an asthmatic airway. IL-5, IL-3, or GM-CSF can
  also stimulate the adhesion of purified human blood eosinophils, thereby leading
  to a vicious cycle. Macrophage produce periostin, and this can enhance the secretion
  of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Furthermore, in the presence of histamine,
  expression of periostin by other cells is enhanced
