caption: Working model for host ATF4’s role in tumour progression and metastasis.
  ATF4 is essential for the CAF activation via direct regulation of Col1a1 expression
  and by impacting multiple additional steps in the collagen synthesis pathway, including
  Glycine (Gly) and Proline (Pro) pools. The resulting abrogation of Collagen I (and
  potentially additional collagen isoforms) in ATF4-deficient FBs leads in dramatic
  reduction in secreted extracellular matrix collagen, which in turn results in defective
  CAF activation and reduced levels of angiogenic cytokine signaling to endothelial
  cells. The resulting defective angiogenesis leads to reduced support for primary
  and metastatic tumour growth.
