caption: Diagram of the Hierarchical Regulatory Process among DAGs, TFs, and DEGs(A)
  DAGs were classified as the top layer, enriched TFs as the middle layer, and upregulated
  DEGs as the bottom layer in a hierarchical regulatory process for SLE, supporting
  the notion that susceptibility variants may have contributed to gene expression
  alteration through TFs, which in turn regulate gene expression aberration in SLE.
  Two Examples (B (pathway involving JAK2) and C (pathway involving CDKN1B)) showing
  that DAGs, TFs, and upregulated DEGS are forming regulatory hierarchical networks
  based on inferred information from protein interaction.
