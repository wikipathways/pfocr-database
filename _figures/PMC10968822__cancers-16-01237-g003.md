caption: Upregulation and downregulation of PD-L1 by YY1 through various factors.
  YY1 indirectly regulates the expression of PD-L1 through several factors. YY1 plays
  a dual role in positively or negatively regulating IFN-γ in different cancers. The
  downregulation of PD-L1 is achieved when YY1 inhibits IFN-γ or COX-2. YY1 activation
  of IFN-γ leads to the activation of the JAK1 and STAT1 pathways, contributing to
  the upregulation of PD-L1 expression. Moreover, YY1 inhibition of PTEN activates
  the PI3K/Akt pathway, and ultimately, mTOR upregulation increases the expression
  of PD-L1. IL-6 and TGF-β are activated and inhibited, respectively, by YY1, leading
  to STAT3 upregulation and increased PD-L1 expression
