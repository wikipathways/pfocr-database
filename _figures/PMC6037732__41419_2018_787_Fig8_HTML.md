caption: Among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, livers from HBV-infected primary
  human hepatocytes (PHHs) in human-liver-chimeric (HLC) mice, HBx-transgenic (Tg)
  mice, and HBx-expressing hepatic cells, B56γ is induced by HBx through ER stress
  CREBH signaling and AP-1 transcription regulation. Upregulation of B56γ is proved
  to promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through dephosphorylating p-Thr55-p53
  and its downstream p21 pathway in hepatocytes
papertitle: ER stress regulating protein phosphatase 2A-B56γ, targeted by hepatitis
  B virus X protein, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of hepatocytes.
