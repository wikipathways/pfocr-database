caption: Schematic showing how retinoids regulate thermogenic gene expression in adipocytes.
  Retinoids are mainly stored as retinyl esters stored in hepatic stellate cells or
  hepatocytes and can be transported as retinol bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP)
  to peripheral tissues including adipose tissue. After uptake via the multi-transmembrane
  cell surface receptor STRA6, retinol is oxidized by alcohol- and retinol dehydrogenases
  (ADH/ RDH) to retinaldehyde which in the next step gets converted to retinoic acid
  (RA) by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH). In the cytosol, retinoic acid is bound to
  cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABP). Retinaldehyde and all-trans RA
  can activate the nuclear retinoic acid receptor (RAR) while 9-cis RA activates both
  RAR and retinoid X receptor (RXR). RXR also forms heterodimers with peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma (PPARγ). RAR and RXR bind as homo- or heterodimers to genomic retinoic
  acid response elements (RARE) which can be found in the promoter region of the UCP1
  gene and thereby regulate thermogenic gene expression. In addition, cold stress
  is the canonical activator of the thermogenic program in adipocytes via stimulation
  of the central nervous system (CNS). Efferent sympathetic neurons activate membrane-bound
  β3-adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) which leads to activation of the protein kinase
  A (PKA)-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) pathway resulting in the
  transcription of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes.
