caption: Targeting to insulin resistance is illustrated and summarized. Clinopodium
  Chinense (CCE) inhibits the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which consequently
  suppresses MyD88/TRIF/TRAF 6 to affect phosphorylation of IRS-1 through inhibition
  of MAPK and NF-kB pathway. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) enhanced Nrf2 expression
  to suppress IKK and JNK, subsequently regulating phosphorylation of p-IRS to activate
  the Akt/eNOS pathway to restore NO production. Adiponectin (APN) inhibited the ROS/IKK-B
  pathway to modulate phosphorylation of IRS-1, which attenuated insulin resistance.
  Phlorizin inhibited SGLT1 and SGLT2 expression to activate the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway
  to restore NO generation. Glycyrrhiza glabra leaf methanolic extract (GGLME) restores
  phosphorylation of IRS-1 to activate the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway
