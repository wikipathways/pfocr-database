caption: Strategies to increase flux of non-natural analogs into glycosylation pathways.
  (a) ManNAc has no effective transport mechanism through the plasma membrane, a problem
  compounded by non-natural variants such as ManNLev; (b) 30–75 mM of these analogs
  are required to maximize flux into the sialic acid pathway and presentation of non-natural
  sialosides such as Sia5Lev on the cell surface (c). (d) ManNPhAc is used much more
  efficiently, presumably because of the hydrophobic phenyl ring that facilitates
  membrane diffusion, as strategy that is extended in the use of SCFA-derivatized
  ‘pro-drugs’ (e) that have ester-linked acetate, propionate, or n-butyrate groups
  that increase cellular uptake by three or more orders of magnitude. (f) The SCFA
  groups are removed by nonspecific esterases upon uptake by a cell (g) and (at least
  in the case of n-butyrate), support HDACi activity (h) while the core sugar is freed
  to impinge upon glycosylation pathways. (i) Thus, acylated analogs support very
  high levels of flux into the sialic acid pathway, with intracellular levels of sialic
  acid increasing from the low micromolar to as high as millimolar levels. The downstream
  effects of increased flux on glycosylation are not always clearcut; for example
  the impact of ‘high-flux’ analogs such as 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc on global patterns of
  glycosylation can be relatively minor for natural core sugars (such as ManNAc),
  which can be explained by constriction points that prevent highly elevated levels
  of intracellular sialic acid from being reflected on the cell surface such as (j)
  limited CTP supplies for creating CMP-sialic acids and (k) lack of sialyltransferases
  or acceptor sites needed for the ultimate installation of sialic acid on the cell
  surface. Conversely, acylation is critical for increasing the replacement of natural
  sialosides with non-natural variants (e.g. ManNLev) that have reduced metabolic
  processing.
