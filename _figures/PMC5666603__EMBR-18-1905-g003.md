caption: (A) SREBP‐1 and/or XBP1(S) signaling are important for cellular adaptation
  of lipid synthesis to cell growth, differentiation (like secretory pathway expansion),
  or the environment (like TAG production in response to nutrients). The mechanisms
  that allow context‐dependent variation in the final outcome of these pathways remain
  under study. (B) Growth signals, including key pathways such as insulin signaling,
  stimulate increased lipid synthesis associated with increased cell biomass. The
  activation of cell growth‐associated lipid synthesis typically requires mTORC1 and
  couples to SREBP‐1 including enhancing SREBP‐1 cleavage. Pro‐growth signaling also
  consistently causes lipin phosphorylation, which converts this enzyme from a nuclear
  localization to a cytosolic localization, and negatively correlates with PtdA‐phosphatase
  activity. This in turn disinhibits CCTα by reducing PtdA metabolism to DAG. Lipin
  PtdA‐phosphatase activity also inhibits SREBP by sequestering cleaved SREBP at the
  nuclear periphery. The inner nuclear membrane CTDNEP/NEP1R1 phosphatase complex
  maintains dephosphorylated lipin and thus counters pro‐growth lipin phosphorylation
  , . Pi, orthophosphate. (C) Pathological impact of elevated TAG production in hepatocytes
  caused by excess nutrients. These cells are functionally specialized to convert
  carbohydrates into TAG. High‐level TAG production from excess nutrients alters the
  ER membrane lipid saturation profile and the ratio between PtdCho and PtdEtn. This
  altered membrane lipid composition induces broader ER dysfunction, included impairing
  calcium transport and protein misfolding.
