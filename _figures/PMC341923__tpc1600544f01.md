caption: Revised Phenylpropanoid Pathway in A. thaliana Showing the Biosynthesis of
  Ferulate, Sinapate, and Lignin Precursors from Phe.Previous versions of the phenylpropanoid
  pathway postulated carbon flux through the intermediates shown in gray and via the
  pathway indicated by the gray arrows. Recent evidence has suggested that the pathway
  is more likely to proceed via the intermediates shown in black. The identification
  of the REF1 protein reverses the previous model of flux. According to this model,
  ferulate and sinapate are products of coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde oxidation,
  rather than being precursors in their synthesis. The enzymes and their abbreviations
  are caffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), (hydroxy)cinnamyl
  alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), (hydroxy)cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR), p-coumaroyl
  shikimate/quinate 3′-hydroxylase (C3′H), 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL), ferulate
  5-hydroxylase (F5H), hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase
  (CST), Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL), caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O-methyltransferase
  (COMT), and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase (SAD). The function of the REF1 protein
  as a bifunctional hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydrogenase is illustrated.
