caption: Summary of the molecular mechanisms leading to immune dysregulation syndromes.  The
  molecular mechanisms associated with the development of immune dysregulation in
  disorders with ineffective apoptosis. When the first apoptosis signal (FAS) binds
  FAS ligand (FASL), the apoptotic pathway is initiated, as FAS‐associated protein
  with death domain (FADD) promotes the activation of pro‐caspase 8 and pro‐caspase
  10, responsible for the initiation of apoptosis. In autoimmune lymphoproliferative
  syndrome‐FAS (ALPS‐FAS), ALPSFASL) and ALPS‐caspase 10 (CASP10) the molecular defect
  is responsible for an impairment of the first molecular steps of the apoptotic cascade.
  Protein kinase C δ (PKC‐δ) promotes the apoptosis through a caspase‐3 dependent
  mechanism, and acts by down‐regulating the B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor
  (TCR) signaling, thus reducing the lymphocyte proliferation. Therefore, in PKC‐δ
  deficiency (PKCD) the apoptotic defect is accompanied by enhanced lymphocyte proliferation.
  (b) Mechanisms responsible for immune dysregulation and lymphadenopathy in diseases
  affecting regulatory T cells (Tregs) functioning. Forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3),
  which is deficient in immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X‐linked
  (IPEX), is central for Tregs proliferation and activity. CD25 is important in activating
  interleukin (IL)‐2‐dependent signaling, and therefore in promoting the transcription
  of FoxP3, which is impaired in CD25 deficiency. Signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT)‐5b is an activator of FoxP3, which is inhibited by STAT‐3.
  In STAT‐3 gain‐of‐function (GOF), the enhanced inhibition of STAT‐5 finally leads
  to reduced FoxP3 activity and Tregs proliferation. Also, the BTB domain and CNC
  homolog 2 (BACH‐2) has a role in promoting Treg proliferation, which is altered
  in patients with BACH2‐related immunodeficiency and autoimmunity (BRIDA). Cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA‐4), through interaction with the co‐stimulatory molecules
  CD80/CD86 on the antigen‐presenting cells (APC) surface, reducing their availability
  for the interaction with CD28 expressed by T cells. CTLA‐4 deficiency results in
  ineffective inhibition of co‐stimulatory signaling, leading to enhanced activation
  of T cells. Finally, lipopolysaccharide‐responsive and beige‐like anchor (LRBA)
  inhibits the lysosomal degradation of CTLA‐4, and in LRBA deficiency with autoantibodies,
  Treg cell defects, autoimmune infiltration and enteropathy (LATAI) a secondary CTLA‐4
  deficiency is observed
