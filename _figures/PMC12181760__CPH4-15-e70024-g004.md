caption: 'Microbial metabolites and their role in cardiovascular pathophysiology.
  High fat, low fiber foods and diet rich in phosphatidylcholine, choline, and L‐carnitine
  (such as red meat, cheese, seafood, egg yolk, etc.) is metabolized by specific gut
  microbiota to TMA which is further oxidized in the liver by FMOs to produce TMAO.
  TMAO contributes to CVD through several mechanisms such as inflammation, foam cell
  formation, arterial cholesterol deposition and platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis.
  HFD induced gut dysbiosis can impair the gut barrier which leads to enhanced LPS
  or pathogens translocating into the circulation causing endotoxemia that stimulates
  the release of systemic pro‐inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines trigger damage
  of endothelial cells through interaction with TLR‐4 on cellular surface and enhance
  the generation of ROS to reduce endothelial NO bioavailability resulting in the
  formation of plaque and atherosclerosis lesion and thereby leads to CVD. A low‐fiber
  diet results in decreased production of SCFAs by gut bacteria. SCFAs help regulate
  blood pressure by activating receptors like Olf78 and GPR41. With fewer SCFAs, blood
  pressure rises, damaging the aortic endothelium and increasing the risk of CVD.
  Primary BAs are synthesized from dietary fats or cholesterol via enterohepatic circulation.
  BAs activate receptors like FXR and TGR5, which help regulate lipid metabolism,
  glucose levels, and inflammation. However, an imbalance in bile acids can disrupt
  these pathways, increasing the risk of CVD. Dietary proteins rich in aromatic amino
  acids such as Phe could be converted into phenylacetic acid via the gut microbiota
  and then transferred into PAG in the liver. PAG acts on G‐protein coupled receptors
  including α2A, α2B and β2‐ARs to facilitate platelet responsiveness, thrombosis
  potential to promote atherosclerotic leads to CVD. The other gut microbial derived
  metabolite: IS from Trp and pCS from Tyr could also predict CVD events in CKD patients
