caption: Inhibition of Gal-1 by OTX008 results in HRAS mistargeting to the cell membrane,
  leading to the blockage of mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogenic pathway, whereas
  rapamycin decreases mammalian target of rapamycinsurvival signaling. Combination
  of OTX008 and rapamycin yields more effective treatment against tumor progression.
  Blockage of Gal-3 with MCP/GSC-100 activates caspase-8 and -9 pathways and induces
  NOXA protein, leading to decrease in MCL-1 and BCL-XL. Inhibition of nuclear Gal-3
  induces cell-cycle inhibitor p21Cip1 expression and blocks the expression of cyclins,
  leading to cell death. Inhibition of Gal-3 with MCP/GSC-100 reduces KRAS-activated
  tumor progression. The combined treatment using MCP/GCS-100 and rapamycin together,
  however, has revealed more promising results in the KRAS mutant tumor progression
  experimental models. Figure is modified from []
