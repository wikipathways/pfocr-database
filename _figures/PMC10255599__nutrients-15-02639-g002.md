caption: 'Vitamin D and resveratrol immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  Vitamin D interacts with the cells of the innate immunity by activating TLRs and
  upregulating CYP27B1. The mechanism by which TLR binding improves CYP27B1 expression
  involves JAK-STAT, C/EBPβ, and p38 MAPK pathways. Following TLRs stimulation, vitamin
  D activates innate immunity, increasing cathelicidins and β-defensins. VDR is expressed
  in many immune cells. Once vitamin D is hydroxylated interacts with VDR, vitamin
  D/VDR complex negatively regulates STAT3. Vitamin D exerts its effects through genomic
  mechanisms modulated by VDR/RXR complex to bind to VDRE in target genes of immune
  cells such as neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B lymphocytes.
  VDRE promotes the recruitment of nuclear proteins in transcriptional-complex-modulating
  inflammatory response. Resveratrol acts against COVID-19 inhibiting TRIF signaling
  in the TLRs pathway by RIP1/TANK in the TRIF complex. It inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation.
  Resveratrol reduces COX-2 expression by preventing TRIF signaling. Resveratrol also
  activates the SIRT1 pathway, which disrupts TLR4/NF-κB/STAT signal, decreasing cytokine
  storm. Resveratrol-inducing SIRT1 can mediate β-defensins induction. Both vitamin
  D and resveratrol inhibit NF-κB and consequently, NLRP3 inflammasome, avoiding CD4+
  T cell activation and cytokine storm. Abbreviations: AP1—activator protein 1; C/EBPβ—CCAAT/enhancer
