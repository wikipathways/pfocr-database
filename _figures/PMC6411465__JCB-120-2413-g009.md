caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the proposed mechanism of AR‐CD44‐SOX2 signaling.
  Purple highlights CD44‐SOX2 pathway leading to EMT and hence migration. Red highlights
  AR expression downregulates not only the expression of CD44 and SOX2 but also the
  processes of EMT and migration in prostate cancer PC3 cells. AR, androgen receptor;
  CD44, cluster of differentiation 44; EMT, epithelial‐mesenchymal transition; SOX2,
  sex‐determining region Y (SRY)‐box 2

  cancer cells (PC3) by repression of CD44 and SOX2.
