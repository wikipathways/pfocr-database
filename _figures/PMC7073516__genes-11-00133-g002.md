caption: Fast and slow routes to break-induced telomere synthesis. Following double
  strand break response and end resection at ALT telomeres, two different pathways
  can be invoked, both leading to break-induced telomere synthesis. One involves the
  recruitment of RAD51 and HOP2-MND1 to the resected end, followed by RAD51-mediated
  homology search. This process, however, is believed to be slower than the second
  pathway, which involves the faster loading of the replication factor C (RFC)-mediated
  proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA, acting as an early sensor of telomere damage.
  PCNA then recruits Pol δ, with its subunit POLD3 crucial for telomere elongation.
