caption: A) Wnt family members initiate signaling by interacting with Frizzled (FZ)
  receptors and LRP5 or LRP6. Wnt stimulates a variety of intracellular signaling
  routes, including the canonical β-catenin pathway wherein β-catenin is stabilized
  due to GSK3 inhibition and translocates to the nucleus, where it promotes stem cell
  self-renewal. However, GSK3 inhibition may also result in the activation of mTOR
  due to inactivation of the TSC2, which inhibits RHEB, thereby initiating mTOR-driven
  stem cell senescence programs. B) The GPCR-like LGR5 and 6 are expressed in stem
  cells, where they potentiate Wnt signaling when bound to R-spondins (RSp). LGR5/6
  may be able to activate G proteins in response to R-spondins or other ligands. C)
  The release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine promotes the growth of stem cells
  in the salivary gland by acting on Gαq-coupled muscarinic 1 (M1) receptors though
  Ca+2 release and activation of PKC. D) Notch signaling is dispensable for stem cell
  self-renewal but necessary to induce differentiation of epithelial stem cells. LGN,
  NuMA and dynactin (Dctn1) control asymmetric cell division and differentiation by
  activating Notch signaling. The distribution of asymmetric cell division components
  is polarized in mitotic basal keratinocytes, where they form an apical crescent
  of LGN and an interacting partner, NuMA. NuMA in turn binds microtubules and interacts
  with cytoplasmic Dctn1. LGN is thought to be recruited to the cell membrane through
  Gαi3.
