caption: Sterol/steroid biosynthesis in plant and in human. A, DWF1 function in the
  biosynthetic pathway for plant sterols and steroids (brassinolide). The enzyme catalyzes
  both the isomerization of the Δ24(28) bond into a Δ24(25) bond and the subsequent
  reduction of the Δ24(25) bond from plant-sterol intermediates 24-methylenecholesterol
  and isofucosterol, to produce campesterol (plant-steroid precursor) and sitosterol
  (major plant sterol), respectively. B, Reduction, by DWF1, of the Δ24(25) bond from
  plant-sterol intermediates, which resembles the reduction, catalyzed by DHCR24 and
  required for the synthesis of cholesterol, of the Δ24 bond from desmosterol.
