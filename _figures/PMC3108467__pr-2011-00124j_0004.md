caption: (A) IFN signaling pathway coded with identified proteins on day 7 postinfection.
  Gray proteins were identified but did not reach statistical significance. (B) Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis highest scoring interaction network. Increased synthesis rates
  are indicated by increasing intensity of red; decreased synthesis rates are denoted
  in green.
