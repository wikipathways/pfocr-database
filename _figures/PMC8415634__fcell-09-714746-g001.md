caption: 'Wnt signaling pathways: Canonical Signaling- Wnt-Off: In absence of the
  ligand (Wnt), the receptor (Frizzled/Fz) and co-receptor LRP5/6 (Arrow) remain in
  an inactive state at the plasma membrane. In the cytoplasm, components of the destruction
  complex (GSK-3β, APC, CK-1, Axin) bind and phosphorylate the nuclear effector β-catenin,
  followed by its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In the nucleus, transcriptional
  repressor Groucho (Gro) binds to the co-factor TCF and keeps Wnt target gene expression
  off. Canonical signaling- Wnt-On: Binding of Wnt to the Fz receptor recruits LRP5/6
  forming an active receptor complex, which leads to Dishevelled (Dsh)-mediated inactivation
  of the destruction complex. The consequential accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm
  enables its nuclear import. The nuclear β-catenin replaces Gro from TCF forming
  a transcriptional activator complex leading to Wnt target gene expression. Non-canonical
  Wnt/PCP pathway: The binding of Wnt to the Fz receptor leads to the recruitment
  of Dsh. This complex along with the co-receptors, for example, receptor tyrosine
  kinase-like orphan receptor (Ror) and tyrosine-protein kinase (Ryk) can activate
  effector kinases like RhoA/ROCK, which leads to actin polymerization. Wnt proteins
  can also induce the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway through
  both Fz-Dsh-Ror/Ryk and Vangl-Ror/Ryk protein complexes. Non-canonical Wnt/Ca2 +pathway:
  Fz receptor recruits the co-receptors Ror/Ryk upon binding of Wnt ligands which
  activates Dsh and G-proteins (α,β) at the membrane forming an active cluster. This
  results in the activation of phospholipase-C (PLC) leading to the release of intracellular
  calcium ions. Increased calcium levels further activate different pathways mediated
  by downstream effectors namely Calcineurin (Cn), Calmodulin dependent protein Kinase
  II (CAMK II) and Protein Kinase C (PKC).'
