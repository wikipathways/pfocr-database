caption: A map of the ssf gene cluster is shown in . The putative boundaries are determined
  based on sequence analysis and biosynthetic logic. The ssf genes identified along
  with their proposed function are listed in . Represented within are genes likely
  responsible for the biosynthesis of the aglycon 8, pendant groups 14, 19 and 25,
  as well as regulation and self-resistance. Based on the putative functions of these
  genes, the proposed biosynthetic pathways of 8 and the subsequent tailoring of 8
  to 1 are shown in  and , respectively.
