caption: Model for the Pah1-mediated regulation of Cho1 expression and lipid synthesis
  during growth. The diagram shows the Henry regulatory circuit, which includes the
  repressor Opi1, the Ino2–Ino4 activator complex, and the UASINO element in CHO1
  (), and the bifurcation of PA for the synthesis of TAG and phospholipids via the
  CDP–DAG pathway. Under growth conditions (e.g. exponential phase; left) whereby
  Pah1 expression (green highlight) and PAP activity are low (), the level of PA is
  elevated, and the Opi1 repressor is tethered to the nuclear/ER membrane via its
  interactions with PA and Scs2. The inhibition of Opi1 for its nuclear entry allows
  for the transcriptional activation (boldface arrow) of CHO1 by the Ino2–Ino4 complex
  and the inductions of Cho1 (pink highlight) and PSS activity for increased phospholipid
  synthesis (large letters) via the CDP–DAG pathway (this work). The reduced rate
  of TAG synthesis in the exponential phase of growth () is indicated with small gray
  letters. Under growth conditions (e.g. stationary phase; right) whereby Pah1 expression
  (pink highlight) and PAP activity are high (), the synthesis of TAG is elevated
  (large letters) and the PA level is reduced (small gray letters). The reduction
  of the PA level allows for the dissociation of Opi1 from the nuclear/ER membrane
  and its entry into the nucleus, where it represses the transcriptional activation
  of CHO1 (thin gray arrow and letters) by inhibiting the function of the Ino2–Ino4
  activator complex through its binding to Ino2. The repression of Cho1 (green highlight)
  and PSS activity results in the reduction of phospholipid synthesis (small gray
  letters).
