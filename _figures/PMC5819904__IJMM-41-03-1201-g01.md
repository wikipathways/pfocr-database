caption: Regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the off-state, APC,
  GSK3, Axin and CK1 form into the APC/GSK3/Axin/CK1 complex, which mediates the phosphorylation
  of β-catenin, repressing Wnt/β-catenin target gene transcription in the cytoplasm.
  In the on-state, Wnt binds with receptor Fzd and LRP5/6, forming into the Wnt/Fzd/LRP5/6
  complex, and then phosphorylates and activates Dvl. Next, Dvl inhibits the activity
  of the APC/GSK3/Axin/CK1 complex, causing β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm
  and then translocate into the nucleus to form a complex with the TCF/LEF family
  and induce gene expression. Phosphorylated β-catenin promotes degradation of TAZ
  via interaction with YAP/TAZ. sFRP1 inhibits β-catenin, which is inhibited by GSK3β
  and induces OHT, resulting in primary open-angle glaucoma. TEAD, transcriptional
  enhancer factor TEF-1; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli; GSK3, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3; CK1, casein kinase 1; LRP5/6, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related

  motif; YAP, Yes-associated protein; sFRP1, secreted frizzled-related protein 1;
