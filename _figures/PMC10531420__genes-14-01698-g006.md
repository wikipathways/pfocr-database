caption: 'The seasonal transcriptional regulation of critical genes in the lignin
  biosynthetic pathway in the secondary cell wall formation. Metabolites in each step
  of the lignin biosynthetic pathway are shown in the box, and all related genes are
  shown to the side. PAL (Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase); C4H (Cinnamate 4-Hydroxylase);
  4CL (4-Coumarate: CoA Ligase); CCR (Cinnamoyl-CoA Reductase); HCT (Hydroxycinnamoyl-Coa:Shikimate/Quinate
  Hydroxycinnamoyltransferase); C3H (Coumaric Acid 3-Hydroxylase); CSE (Caffeoyl Shikimate
  Esterase); COMT (Caffeic Acid O-Methyltransferase); CCoAOMT (Caffeoyl-Coenzyme A
  3-O-Methyltransferase); CAD (Cinnamyl-Alcohol Dehydrogenase); LAC (Laccase); PRX
  (Peroxidase); and F5H (Ferulate 5-hydroxylase). The seasonal wood formation of CW
  and OW was shown by the up- and down-regulated of each gene in SP compared to FA,
  indicated as the color bar (blue to black, respectively). The CW formation in SP
  was shown by the up- and down-regulated of each gene in CW compared to OW, indicated
  as the color bar (red to green, respectively). The fold change value was the average
  of two sampling sets. CW (Compression Wood), OW (Opposite Wood), SP (Spring), SM
  (Summer), and FA (Fall).'
