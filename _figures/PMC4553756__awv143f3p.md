caption: Delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS) pathway. Schematic of the
  P5CS pathway. Enzyme-catalysed steps of proline and ornithine synthesis from glutamate,
  as well as urea cycle, are in dark grey. Mutations in ALDH18A1 and PYCR1 were previously
  reported in autosomal recessive neurocutaneous syndromes (; ), with some pyramidal
  involvement. Deficiencies for arginase (ARG1 mutations) and ornithine transporter
  (SLC25A15 mutations, triple H syndrome) also share features of motor neuron degeneration
  (). We speculate that a decrease in the mitochondrial ornithine pool may be the
  common feature of the latter two and ALDH18A1-linked autosomal dominant HSP.
