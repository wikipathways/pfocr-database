caption: Schematic representation of the classical complement pathway initiated by
  mAbs and its inhibitors. All three complement pathways (classical, lectin, and alternative)
  converge on the level of C3 and lead to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC)
  of the target cell by the formation of the membrane-attack complex (MAC). The classical
  pathway is induced upon binding of C1q to an antibody-opsonized target cell. Opsonin,
  ficolins and the carbohydrate binding protein mannose binding lectin (MBL) are expressed
  on foreign targets and their recognition leads to the activation of the lectin pathway.
  The alternative pathway is activated by water in the steady-state in a process known
  as tick-over. Furthermore, it functions as a positive amplification loop of the
  classical pathway as it initially does not require C1, C2, and C4 but processes
  C3b covalently bound to the target cell to generate more deposited C3b. Cleavage
  products in fluid phase and deposited on the target cell membrane recruit effector
  cells resulting in complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The complement cascade
  is tightly controlled by soluble and membrane-bound complement-regulatory proteins
  (CRPs in red). CRPs function relies on their ability to adhere to or remove cleavage
  products required for the initiation of the next step in the complement cascade.
  Additionally, CRPs have cofactor functions for negative regulators of the complement
  cascade, hence enhancing their inhibitory effect on the convertases.
