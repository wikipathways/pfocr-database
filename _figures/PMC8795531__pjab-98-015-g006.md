caption: (A) Outline of biosynthetic pathway for PRM-A. (B) Biosynthetically 13C-enriched
  PRM-As. Black and open circles indicate 13C-enriched positions. Whereas d-[13C3]alanine
  was exclusively introduced to the d-alanine moiety of PRM-A, dl-[13C3]alanine feeding
  increased the 13C-population of d-alanine moiety and the aromatic region probably
  through the metabolic conversion of l-[13C3]alanine to [13C2]acetyl-CoA. Feeding
  of 13C-labeled NaOAc similarly increased the 13C-population of the aromatic region,
  but severely inhibited the growth of the actinomycete, resulting in the low isolation
  yield of 13C-labeled PRM-A. The 13C population was calculated from the solution
  1H-NMR data on the basis of integration values of proton signals split with 1H–13C
  couplings.
