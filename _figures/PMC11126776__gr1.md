caption: The damage of weaning stress on the intestinal barrier of piglets. In intestinal
  homeostasis, Paneth and goblet cells secrete lysozyme, defensins and MUC respectively,
  which contribute to the maintenance of intestinal mucosal homeostasis and barrier
  function, and reduce the abundance of pathogens. Immune cells secrete IL-10 and
  TGF-β to promote the differentiation of TReg. At the same time, the abundant probiotic
  bacteria in the gut of normal piglets produce SCFA to provide energy to the host.
  Under weaning stress, immune cells produce excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  including IL-1β, IL-8 and TNF-α, reduce the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins
  and increase intestinal permeability. Moreover, the abundance of probiotics decreased
  and that of pathogenic bacteria increased when piglets were weaned. Toll-like receptors
  recognize pathogens and then initiate the NF-κB signaling pathway to initiate inflammatory
  response. MUC = mucins; TReg = T regulatory cells; SCFA = short-chain fatty acids;
  TGF-β = transforming growth factor-β; IL = interleukin; TNF-α = tumor necrosis factor-α;
  NF-κB = nuclear factor κB
