caption: 'DAB2IP in TNFα signaling: activation of ASK1/JNK. Tumor necrosis factor
  alpha can trigger cell death or induce NF-κB-mediated transcription of inflammatory,
  pro-survival, and pro-invasive genes. This pathway is initiated by the recruitment
  of adaptor protein TRADD (TNFR-associated death domain protein), serine-threonine
  kinase RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein-1), and TRAF2 to the intracellular domain
  of the activated TNFR1 (TNF receptor 1). This complex recruits and activates the
  multisubunit kinase IKK, responsible for the inhibitory phosphorylation of IκB.
  It has been demonstrated that RIP1 activates the IKKs indirectly via MEKK3. Once
  phosphorylated, IκB undergoes polyubiquitination and degradation, releasing p65/p50
  NF-κB from its inhibitory binding, and leading to transcriptional activation.,  Ligand-bound
  TNFR1 can also catalyze formation of a multiprotein complex that recruits and activates
  ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase), leading to activation of the pro-apoptotic
  JNK and p38 MAP kinases. DAB2IP promotes TNF-induced activation of the ASK1–JNK
  axis by sequestering TRAF2 from the NF-κB-activating complex, driving formation
  of the so-called AIP1 complex. DAB2IP binds membrane phospholipids through its PH/C2
  domain in a closed and inactive conformation; upon TNF stimulation, RIP1 phosphorylates
  DAB2IP on Serine 604, inducing a conformational switch that allows formation of
  the complex. DAB2IP then displaces the inhibitory binding between ASK1 and 14-3-3
  protein, favoring ASK1 activation. DAB2IP also mediates recruitment of PP2A to ASK1,
  binding both proteins through its C2 domain; this favors removal of the inhibitory
  S967 phosphorylation and further activation of ASK1'
