caption: Physiological and rearranged NTRK genes/TRK receptors and intracellular signaling.
  The PLC-γ, MAPK, and PI3-K intracellular pathways (here represented by the DAG/IP3,
  RAS/MEK/ERK, and PI3-K/AKT components, respectively) are activated either from the
  wild-type form of NTRK, and the chimeric fusion receptors (e.g., BCAN-NTRK1 and
  ETV6-NTRK3). However, the latter happens in a ligand-free constitutively activated
  fashion, leading to oncogenic activation. The NTRK inhibitors (TKI, here represented
  by entrectinib and larotrectinib) achieve their antitumor activity by interacting
  with the intracellular domain of the chimeric receptors, inhibiting the recruitment
  of the signaling pathway.
