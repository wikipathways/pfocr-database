caption: Mammalian TLR signaling pathway. TLR2 usually forms heterodimers with TLR1
  or TLR6. On the cell membrane, TLR2-TLR1 and TLR2-TLR6 heterodimers recognize triacyl
  and diacyl lipopeptides, respectively. In TLR2-TLR1-ligand complex, two of the three
  lipid chains of triacyl lipopeptide interact with TLR2, while the third chain binds
  to the hydrophobic channel of TLR1. Therefore, it promotes the recognition of triacyl
  lipopeptides. However, TLR6 lacks hydrophobic channels, so TLR2-TLR6 heterodimer
  does not recognize triacyl lipid peroxides. TLR5 recognizes flagellin and depends
  on MyD88 pathway. TLR11 identifies pathogenic bacterial components and profilin-like
  molecules derived from Toxoplasma gondii. In cytoplasm, TLR3 recognizes the dsRNA
  of the virus. It can bind to the N and C terminals of the convex extracellular domain
  of TLR3, which helps to form homologous dimers through the C terminal region, thus
  activating the TRIF-dependent pathway. TLR7 recognizes ssRNA and activates NF-κB
  and IRF7 through MyD88 to induce inflammatory cytokines and IFN I, respectively.
  TLR9 recognizes the CpG DNA motifs of bacteria and viruses. Downstream signal transduction
  requires proteolytic cleavage of TLR9 by cytoproteinase. TLR9 recruits MyD88 to
  activate NF-κB and IRF7. The ligand of TLR10 is unknown. The only one that uses
  all four adapters is TLR4, which can activate both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways.
  TLR4 recruits TIRAP on the plasma membrane and then promotes the aggregation of
  MyD88, triggering NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. TLR4 then relies on endocytosis
  of the initiator protein and is transported to the endosomes, forming signal transduction
  complexes with TRAM and TRIF to initiate IRF3 activation and late TRIF-dependent
  pathways. The main result of TLR signal transduction is to induce the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN I
