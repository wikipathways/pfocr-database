caption: Illustration representing the probable site of action of bioactive polyphenols.
  Upon exposure to harmful particles and pathogens, macrophages are activated, triggering
  the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) and reactive oxygen
  species. This cascade activates the NF-κB pathway and immune response genes, resulting
  in airway inflammation, structural remodeling, and lung damage, ultimately culminating
  in COPD. The figure was designed by Biorender.com program (https://biorender.com/,
