caption: a) The proposed synthetic route for the synthesis of mesalazine (5‐ASA) from
  2‐chlorobenzoic acid (2ClBA), via a 3‐step synthetic process. Each step will be
  analyzed in real‐time using a different PAT tool, as well as a final analysis by
  UHPLC. b) Impurity map, showing the main expected impurities in this multistep process.
  Intermediates along the desired reaction pathway are depicted in boxes.
