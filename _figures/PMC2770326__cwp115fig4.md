caption: Pathway options for sialic acid glycoengineering. Analogs can be introduced
  into the sialic acid metabolic machinery (as shown in detail in Figure 2) at several
  points. (A) GlcNAc analogs can enter the hexosamine pathway by salvage mechanisms
  but subsequent entry into the sialic acid pathway is severely restricted by the
  strict substrate specificity of GNE. (B) ManNAc analogs can feed directly into the
  canonical sialic acid pathway but constraints on the size and position of nonnatural
  modifications to this metabolite are posed by the bottleneck enzyme NANS. (C) Sialic
  acid analogs bypass the NANS bottleneck and can be modified at both the C5 (N-acyl)
  and C9 (OH) positions. (D) CMP-Neu5Ac analogs enter the pathway at the final stage
  and need only to be processed by sialyltransferases; however, the membrane impermeability
  of these compounds severely restricts their intake into the Golgi lumen where they
  are required for biosynthetic incorporation. Additional analogs, and literature
  references for the analogs shown in this figure, are provided in Table S2 of the
  Supplementary Data available online.
