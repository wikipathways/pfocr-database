caption: 'Unigenes associated with the biosynthesis of rutin and their expression
  levels across different tissues of Mallotus japonicus. (a) Proposed rutin biosynthetic
  pathway and related metabolites in M. japonicus. ‘*’, ‘#’, and ‘$’ represent the
  metabolite features mapped to the KNApSAcK database, KEGG database, and MS2-based
  fragmentation data in the M. japonicus metabolome database, respectively; (b) Heatmap
  representing the expression of transcripts assigned to the rutin biosynthetic pathway
  in M. japonicus. Abbreviations: PAL/PTAL: phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase,
