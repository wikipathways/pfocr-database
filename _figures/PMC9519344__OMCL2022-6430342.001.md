caption: Regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response plays an important regulatory role in cell physiological
  activities. Under stress stimulation conditions such as ischemia/hypoxia or inflammation,
  the homeostasis of intracellular environment and mitochondrial homeostasis will
  be further destroyed. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disturbance, excessive
  ROS, impaired complex assembly (mitotic nucleoprotein imbalance), and accumulation
  of misfolded proteins further activate HSP47/PDIA46/ERDJ4 under the induction of
  mitochondrial proteins. Meanwhile, BIP/HRD-1 and IRE1α will activate in the intima.
  Together with HSP47/PDIA46/ERDJ4, it regulates the homeostasis of mitochondrial
  matrix and mitochondrial proteins, which is an important mechanism affecting mitochondrial
  protein homeostasis.
