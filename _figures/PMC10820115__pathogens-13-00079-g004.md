caption: 'The polyamine biosynthetic pathway of trypanosomatid (African, American
  trypanosomes and Leishmania) is much simpler than the host pathway and lacks spermine
  and the whole interconversion pathway. However, it is in part devoted to ROS detoxification
  by means of the conjugation of spermidine to glutathione to form trypanothione (see
  Figure 3). Polyamine biosynthesis has some specific peculiarities involving: the
  lack of a true arginase in T. brucei and T. cruzi and the lack of the odc encoding
  gene in T. cruzi that make this parasite auxotrophic for putrescine and/or spermidine.
  Abbreviations of the enzymes and transporters and their corresponding EC numbers
  are given in alphabetic order: AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethione decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50);
  Arginase (EC 3.5.3.1); DHS, deoxyhypusine synthase (EC: 2.5.1.46); DOHH deoxyhypusine
  hydroxylase (EC 1.14.99.29); MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.6); ODC,
  ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17); POT1, putrescine transport 1 (EC 7.6.2.16);
  SpdS, spermidine synthase (EC 2.5.1.16); Abbreviations for the metabolites are also
  given in alphabetic order: AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; dcAdoMet, decarboxylated
  S-adenosylmethionine; eIF5A, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A; dh-eIF5A,
  deoxyhypusine-eIF5A; h-eIF5A, hypusine-eIF5A'
