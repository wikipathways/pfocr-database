caption: 'Interplay between Nrf2 and Brf2 pathways. The Nrf2 pathway is activated
  through the redox stress: under basal conditions, Nrf2 is ubiquitinylated by Keap1
  and Cul3 and targeted for proteosomal degradation. Under stress, the structure of
  Keap1 is altered and the newly synthesized Nrf2 molecules can translocate into the
  nucleus to form a complex with its binding partner sMAF and transcribe target genes.
  TFIIIB, composed of TBP, Bdp1 and Brf2, recruits the RNA polymerase III machinery
  to transcribe a small set of genes, including the SeCys tRNA. Brf2 is redox sensitive
  and, as a consequence, controls the transcriptional output in function of the redox
  state of the cell. Efficient translation of the phase II detoxification enzymes
  containing selenocysteine requires both high levels of their mRNA and high levels
  of SeCys tRNA. At low levels of stress, the proteins can be synthesized due to availability
  of both components, ensuring cell survival. At high levels of redox stress, however,
  the lack of SeCys tRNA results in impaired detoxification enzymes and redox homeostasis
  regulators, triggering apoptosis to protect the cells from further accumulation
  of damage.'
