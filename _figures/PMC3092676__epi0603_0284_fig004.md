caption: Emerging molecular functions of RASSF8. RASSF8 has been observed binding
  to ASPP (apoptotic specific regulator of p53) in both Drosophila and human cells.
  Drosophila ASPP acts in conjunction with dCSK (Drosophila c-SRC tyrosine kinase)
  and SRC to regulate adherens junction stability as well as serving as a stimulator
  of p53-mediated apoptosis. The role of human RASSF8 in these processes still requires
  further study to confirm these observations. However, loss of RASSF8, via RNAi-mediated
  knockdown, leads to translocation of β-catenin, a component of the canonical Wnt
  signalling pathway, into the nucleus and activation of the TCF-LEF promoter. NFκB
  p65 also relocates to the nucleus causing NFκB-dependent promoter activity. This
  may lead to upregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation. RASSF8 depletion
  is also followed by loss of intercellular contact and a concomitant increase in
  cell motility.
