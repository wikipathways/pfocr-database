caption: A, Complete schematic of VEGFR2 signaling to the ERK MAPK cascade. The MAPK
  cascade is controlled though the activation of Ras. Ras activation occurs through
  Shc-independent and Shc-dependent pathways. B, All reactions involving R2 complexes
  have a counterpart in the endosomal compartment. All receptors or receptor complexes
  are internalized, recycled and degraded at different rates for ligated and unligated
  receptors. These parameters are estimated based on optimization of model outputs
  against experimental data, and determine the localization of VEGFR2. VEGF may dissociate
  from all VEGFR2 complexes, resulting in a disintegration of the complex. ‘iR2’ and
  ‘dR2’ refers to internalized and degraded receptors respectively. ‘X’ refers to
  any molecular species bound to VEGFR2.
