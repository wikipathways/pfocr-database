caption: 'HGF/c-MET signaling pathway network: After tumor-associated fibroblasts
  (CAF) produce and secrete inactive precursor HGF (Pro-HGF), Pro-HGF is converted
  to active HGF by matriptase on the surface of the cancer cell and binds to its receptor
  c-MET, resulting in heterodimerization of c-MET monomers. Residues Y1234 and Y1235
  present in the catalytic domain undergo autophosphorylation, which in turn phosphorylates
  the C-terminal tyrosine residues (Y1349, Y1356), and serves as a docking site for
  downstream bridging molecules. The downstream docking molecules include GAB1, GRB2,
  SHC, CRK, PI3K, PLCγ1, SHP2, and STAT3, which further activate the downstream pathways
  of HGF/c-MET, including RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, Wnt/β-Catenin, and JAK/STAT, to drive
  transcriptome changes and ultimately mediate the phenotypic changes of the cancer
  cells, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. This figure
