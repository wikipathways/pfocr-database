caption: Schematic diagram of molecular signaling pathways relevant to the resistance
  to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Schematic summary of key molecular players in parental
  and resistant cells. MAPK and mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathways simultaneously promote
  cellular proliferation. Phosphorylation of rpS6 on Ser235/236 is positively primarily
  regulated by hyperactivated MAPK signaling in A375 cells. However, in A375-DR and
  A375-TR cells, phosphorylation of rpS6 at Ser235/236 is more dependent on the mTOR/P70S6K
  signaling pathway, which mediates the resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. Dotted
  lines indicate weak regulation, and triple arrows denote strongly positive regulation
