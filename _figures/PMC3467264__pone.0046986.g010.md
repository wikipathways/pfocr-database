caption: A. IL-1β induces release of NF-κB subunits from regulatory proteins by activating
  the IKKs. In addition, IL-1β promotes phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, increases CCL2
  transcription using the NF-κB pathway, culminating with secretion of CCL2 protein.
  B. The activation of p38 by IL-1β is critical for induction of CCL2 gene expression
  and secretion of CCL2 protein. Inhibiting p38 MAPK activity, either through the
  use of pyridinyl-imidazole based inhibitors or via MKP-1 mediated dephosphorylation,
  impairs synthesis and secretion of CCL2.
