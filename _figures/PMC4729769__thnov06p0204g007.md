caption: Schematic Diagram Depicting the Proposed Role of P-gp in the Formation of
  Peritoneal Adhesions following an Abdominal Operation. In the proposed model, P-glycoprotein
  mediates postoperative peritoneal adhesion formation in four steps. First, operative
  injury induces excessive TGF-β1 secretion by macrophages. Second, TGF-β1 up-regulates
  P-gp expression by enhancing the activity of the MDR1 promoter via the TGF-β1/Smad
  signaling pathway and histone H3 acetylation. Third, P-gp accelerates activation
  of volume-activated Cl- channels and cell RVD capability by promoting phosphorylation
  of ClC-3 via Src tyrosine kinase. Fourth, increased ICl,vol and cell volume regulation
  capability accelerates migration and proliferation of fibroblasts, which finally
  leads to peritoneal adhesion formation.
