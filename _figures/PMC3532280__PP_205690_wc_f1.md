caption: Schematic representation of subcellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) metabolism
  and its generation by the pathway of photorespiration and subsequent signaling through
  the glutathione pool linked to the ascorbate/glutathione cycle, as well as the production
  of ascorbate in the mitochondria and its subsequent transport to the apoplast, where
  it is oxidized by apoplastic enzymes related to extracellular redox signaling pathways.
