caption: Hypoxia signaling pathway. Under normal oxygen levels (normoxia), hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF)-α subunits are hydroxylated by HIF prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins
  (PHDs). PHDs require oxygen (O2), ferrous iron (Fe2+), and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)
  for their activity. Hydroxylated HIFs are recognized and bound by the von Hippel-Lindau
  tumor suppressor protein (VHL). VHL recruits components of the E3-ubiquitin ligase
  complex and facilitates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of hydroxylated
  HIFs. HIF is also regulated in a VHL-independent manner by the activity of factor
  inhibiting HIF1 (FIH), an asparaginyl hydroxylase. The conserved asparaginyl (Asn)
  residue within the C-terminal activation domain in HIFα is hydroxylated under normoxia
  or mild hypoxia, thereby suppressing HIF transcriptional activity by preventing
  interaction with the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP. Conversely, under conditions
  of relatively low oxygen levels (hypoxia), PHD activity and the degradation of HIFα
  subunits as well as FIH activity are inhibited. Therefore, HIFα subunits are stabilized
  and are able to dimerize with the HIFβ subunit. In the nucleus, active HIFα/β dimer
  in complex with other cofactors promote the transcription of target genes with hypoxia
  response elements (HREs) such as transferrin (Tf), erythropoietin (Epo), numerous
  microRNAs, and other genes involved in metabolism, angiogenesis, erythropoiesis,
  steroidogenesis, and other hypoxia regulated processes
