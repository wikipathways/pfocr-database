caption: Contrapuntal Patterns of Gene Expression for Proteins Involved in the Conversion
  of Suc to Oil in Developing Arabidopsis Seeds.Only the major enzymes and transporters
  involved in the conversion of Suc to oil are shown. Microarray expression patterns
  for enzymes in the cytosol are shown with red lines, reactions in the plastid are
  shown with green lines, and membrane transporters are shown with blue lines. Gray
  arrows indicate reactions or transporters whose expression decreases during development;
  they are believed to carry less flux than the major pathway represented by brown
  arrows. The shift during development from starch biosynthesis and cytosolic metabolism
  of PEP to oil biosynthesis and plastid uptake and metabolism of PEP is reflected
  in the coordinated expression patterns of enzymes and transporters. Not shown are
  additional contributions to oil metabolism, such as dark and light reactions of
  photosynthesis, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and others. AcCoa, acetyl-CoA;
  FAS, fatty acid synthesis; GPT, glc-6-P translocator; MalCoA, malonyl-CoA; Pyr,
  pyruvate; TAG, triacylglyceride; TP, triose phosphate; TPT, triose-P translocator.
