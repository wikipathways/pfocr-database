caption: A Overexpression of RSPOs induces increased clearing of negative regulators
  ZNRF3/RNF43 from the membrane, thereby expanding membranous Wnt receptor availability
  and excessive activation of Wnt ligand-mediated pathway activation. B PORCN inhibitors
  block the availability of functional Wnt ligands, allowing the destruction complex
  to form and degrade β-catenin, resulting in inhibition of the Wnt pathway. Indicated
  PORCNi are tested in clinical trials for solid cancers considering the RSPO status.
  C Monoclonal anti-RSPO antibodies disable RSPOs to clear negative regulators ZNRF3/RNF43
  from the membrane, causing ubiquitination and membrane clearance of Wnt receptors,
  as such inhibiting Wnt ligands to activate the pathway. Indicated antibody has been
  tested in a clinical trial for colorectal cancer.
