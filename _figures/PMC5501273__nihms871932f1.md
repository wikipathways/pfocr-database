caption: 'Potential scheme depicting the influence of Angiotensin-(1-7) on the AGE-TGF-β
  signaling pathway: Advanced glycation end products (AGE) binds to the receptor for
  AGE (RAGE) and induces TGF-β potentially by the generation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) through activation of the NADPH oxidase complex [NOX, p22phox (p22), p47phox
  (p47), Rac-1]. TGF-β stimulates the non-canonical pathway MAP kinase pathway to
  promote phosphorylated ERK1/2 to traffic to the nucleus and increase expression
  of EMT/fibrosis genes including α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), fibronectin, collagen
  and TGF-β. The TGF-β pathway may reduce intrinsic Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]
  tone by downregulation of ACE2 and the AT7/Mas receptor (Mas), as well as increased
  degradation of the peptide to Ang-(1-4) through a soluble endopeptidase (Endopep).
  Ang-(1-7) attenuates EMT and fibrosis by inhibiting ERK1/2 phosphorylation potentially
  through the activation of intracellular phosphatases.'
