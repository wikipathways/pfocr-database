caption: NHS Lothian COVID‐adapted colorectal cancer pathway. Patients were triaged
  by colorectal consultants with information provided from general practice (GP).
  They proceeded through the pathway in a step‐wise fashion being stratified by quantitative
  faecal immunochemical test (qFIT) results (CRC, colorectal cancer; CT, computed
  tomography scan; IDA, iron deficiency anaemia; OPD, outpatient department; USOC,
  urgent suspected of cancer)
