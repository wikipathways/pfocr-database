caption: KEGG p53 signaling. p53 is mobilized in response to various signals including
  DNA damage, oxidative stress and oncogene activation usually by phosphorylation
  by elements of the ATM/ATR pathway. p-p53 initiates transcription of target genes
  that result in cell cycle arrest (at both G1 and G2/M), acquisition of a senescent
  phenotype or apoptosis. SERPINE1 (PAI-1) and p21 are prominent members of both the
  cellular senescence () and p53 signaling pathways. TGF-β1 also activates p53 stimulating
  p53Ser9,15 phosphorylation and acetylation, promoting interactions with activated
  SMADs and subsequent binding of p53/SMAD3 complexes to the PAI-1 promoter in human
  renal tubular epithelial cells (). Consistent with a potential in vivo role for
  p53 and SMADs in TGF-β1-driven renal fibrosis, co-induction of pSMAD2/3, p53, p53Ser15
  and the target growth arrest/senescence genes SERPINE1 and p21 are evident in the
  tubular epithelium of the obstructed kidney (e.g., ; ).
