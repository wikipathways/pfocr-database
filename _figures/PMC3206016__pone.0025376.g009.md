caption: Our data showed that PDZ2 and PDZ3 of MAGI1 bind preferentially to the C-termini
  of NET1 (green) and ARHGAP6 (red), respectively. NET1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor (GEF), which transfers a phosphate group (PO) to the small GTPase RhoA, which
  in its GTP-bound form (yellow) is predominantly associated with the membrane and
  stimulates downstream signalling pathways. ARHGAP6 is a GTPase-activating protein
  (GAP), which induces RhoA to release a phosphate group, resulting in the shutdown
  of RhoA signalling. Inactivated GDP-bound RhoA (blue) is mostly present in the cytoplasm.
  This indicates that MAGI1 recruits, via two adjacent PDZ domains, one activator
  and one inhibitor of the RhoA signalling pathway. Remarkably, the four last residues
  of the two proteins NET1 and ARHGAP6 are identical, hence the distinct binding preferences
  of the two C-terminal peptides for PDZ2 and PDZ3 must be defined by residues upstream.
