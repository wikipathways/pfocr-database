caption: A proposed signal transduction pathway of dark-induced senescence. Dark-induced
  senescence is mainly regulated by the red light pathway involving phyB and PIF4/PIF5.
  PIF4 and PIF5 regulate ethylene synthesis and signaling to progress leaf senescence
  in addition to ABA signaling. ABA mainly promotes leaf senescence via ethylene signaling.
  PIF4 and PIF5 also directly regulate senescence-induced senescence regulators (SIRs)
  including the NAC transcription factor ORE1, and senescence-induced senescence executors
  (SIEs) such as Chla-degrading enzyme SGR1, at the early stage of leaf senescence.
  At later stages, SIRs enhance their own expression and activity through a positive
  feedback regulation, which elevates SIE expression and reinforce leaf senescence
  (senescence syndrome). Furthermore, blue light is thought to repress dark-induced
  senescence through cryptochrome (CRY) and cryptochrome-interacting basic-helix-loop-helix
  (CIB).
