caption: 'Proposed model for the protective effects of high levels of cardiorespiratory
  fitness on proinflammatory responses after infection by SARS‐CoV‐2. Binding of the
  virus SARS‐CoV‐2 to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor activates
  the inflammasome, causing the symptomatology in the lungs characteristic of the
  COVID‐19. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and possibly SARS‐CoV‐2, bind to the Toll‐like
  receptors (TLR) to activate the inflammation pathway. Myeloid differentiation primary
  response 88 (MyD88) or TIR domain‐containing adapter‐inducing interferon‐β (TRIF)
  activates tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which in turn
  stimulates caspase 1, inducing the activation of the inflammasomes as well as tumor
  growth factor‐β–activated kinase (TAK) and I kappa B kinase (IKK). This cascade
  ultimately initiates the activation of nuclear factor‐kappa B (NF‐κB) in the nucleus.
  Subsequently, proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNFα),
  IL‐6, and IL‐1β, initiate the inflammatory processes in the lung, giving rise to
  the classic COVID‐19 symptoms. A high level of cardiorespiratory fitness at the
  onset of symptoms may reduce the susceptibility to infection and be beneficial for
  host immune defense against a proinflammatory state. Exercise training may act to
  reduce inflammatory pathways via the following three putative mechanisms: (1) by
  reducing the expression of the TLRs; (2) by increasing the levels of anti‐inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL‐10 and IL‐37, which in turn will inhibit the TLR‐inflammation
  pathway and counteract the inflammatory response induced by the inflammasomes; and
  (3) by activating the AMPK‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the lung, reducing
  the inflammatory processes by allowing for the transformation of Ang II to Ang 1‐7.
