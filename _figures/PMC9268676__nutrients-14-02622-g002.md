caption: Antitumor mechanisms associated with regulation of macrophage polarization.
  The levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were elevated and the expression of IL-10 and TGF-β
  was decreased in protein-bound polysaccharides (PBP) cultured breast cancer cells.
  PBP regulates M1/M2 polarization and exhibits antitumor activities during breast
  cancer progression. Water extracts of Cordyceps sinensis exert anti-breast cancer
  effects by regulating the differentiation of macrophages to M1-like macrophages
  through modulation of NF-κB signaling pathway.
