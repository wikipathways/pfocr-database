caption: Effects of MEHTCMPs on the NLRP3 signaling pathway. ⊥ stands for inhibition,
  → stands for promotion. The NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle is activated in 2 steps.
  First, PAMP- or DAMP-mediated activation of TLR4 or TNFR induces NF-kB signaling,
  leading to elevated expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18 (step 1) Next,
  a large number of signals such as PAMP/DAMPs indirectly activate NLRP3, leading
  to complex assembly and caspase-1 activation (step 2). Activated caspase-1 induces
  secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, leading to inflammation.
