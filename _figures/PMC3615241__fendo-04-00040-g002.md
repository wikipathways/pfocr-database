caption: Feed-forward regulation of NOX-1 expression in beta cells. (A) Experimental
  approach to demonstrate a feed-forward regulation of NOX-1 in beta cells that involves
  NOX activity and cellular redox state. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity (purple
  box) with either a selective NOX-1/4 pyrazolopyridine dione inhibitor (PPD) or general
  inhibitors apocynin (Apo), diphenylene iodonium (DPI) blocks NOX-1 gene and protein
  expression initiated by pro-inflammatory cytokine (PIC) stimulation. This suggests
  NADPH oxidase activity regulates NOX-1 expression. Neutralization of ROS with general
  anti-oxidants (green box) glutathione-ethyl ester (GEE) or butylated hydroxyanisole
  (BHA) inhibited PIC-stimulated NOX-1. Conversely, direct elevation of ROS with pro-oxidants
  (red box) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or pyocyanin, upregulated NOX-1 expression. This
  places ROS elevation in a pathway regulating NOX-1 expression. Interruption of Src-kinase
  signaling with inhibitor PP2 blocked NOX-1 expression induced by pro-oxidant or
  PIC-stimulation. Interruption was not observed using the control (inactive) compound
  PP3. This indicates that activation of Src-kinase signaling that leads to NOX-1
  gene transcription is a consequence of elevated ROS. Beta cell dysfunction, as measured
  by increase in apoptosis and loss of glucose-stimulated-insulin-secretion (GSIS),
  follows sustained elevation of ROS. (B) Candidate effectors of Src-kinase activation
  are shown along with selective inhibitors (italics), which are available to map
  key contributing pathways. In terms of disease pathology, self-sustaining NOX-1
  would lead to unbridled ROS generation, oxidative stress, and induce beta cell dysfunction/destruction.
  Consequently, this pathway has potential for high impact therapeutic intervention.
