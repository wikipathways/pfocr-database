caption: Models of Cdc42 activation. During its activation, Cdc42 switches from a
  GDP-bound inactive state to a GTP-bound active state (thin arrows). A, In the linear
  pathway model, the GTP-bound Cdc42 binds to downstream effectors, controlling filopodial
  activity and, as a direct consequence, leading to directed growth cone navigation.
  B, In the parallel pathways model, Cdc42 activation initiates several separate downstream
  events, with one being responsible for filopodial activation and the other regulating
  cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics during growth cone turning. Arrows do not necessarily
  indicate direct signaling but rather hierarchical events. C, Stereotyped motor and
  sensory axon pathways in the Drosophilaembryo. In each abdominal half-segment, the
  motoneuron axons are grouped into five nerves (ISN, SNa,SNb, SNc, andSNd). The LBD
  sensory neuron extends an afferent axon (LBD) via its own pathway near the segment
  border into the CNS. The CNS is to the left, and nine distal (dorsal) muscle cells
  are not shown.
