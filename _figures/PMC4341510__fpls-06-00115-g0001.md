caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway leading to paclitaxel. GGPP is synthesized by geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase (GGPPS). GGPP is then converted to taxadiene by taxadiene synthase
  (TASY) (Wildung and Croteau, ) and then to taxadien-5α-ol by taxadien-5α-ol hydroxylase
  (T5α H) (Jennewein et al., ). Several steps leading from the diol intermediate to
  functionalized taxanes, including the formation of the oxetane ring, are unknown.
  Taxane 2α-O-benzoyltransferase (DBBT) (Walker and Croteau, ) produces 10-deacetylbaccatin
  III (10-DAB). 10-DAB is then converted to baccatin III by 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyltransferase
  (DBAT) (Walker and Croteau, ). Baccatin III: 3-amino, 3-phenylpropanoyltransferase
  (BAPT) ligates the side chain [derived from phenylalanine via phenylalanine aminomutase
  (PAM) (Jennewein et al., )] to produce 3′-N-debenzoyl-2-deoxypaclitaxel (Walker
  et al., ). An unknown P450-mediated hydroxylation of the side chain forms 3′-N-debenzoyl
  paclitaxel. 3′-N-debenzoyl-2-deoxypaclitaxel-N-benzoyltransferase (DBTNBT) then
  produces paclitaxel by benzoylation of the side chain (Walker et al., ).'
