caption: Model of the potential signaling pathway of NO in C. sinensis pollen tube
  response to low temperature. This summarized model was based on the results reported
  by Wang et al. [] and Lyzenga ea al. []. Plant hormone signaling pathways (ABA,
  BRs, ET and auxin) respond to pollen germination and tube elongation at low temperature,
  and then TFs (MYB, ZFP, CAMTA and MADS-box) modulated relevant proteins expression.
  Moreover, the UPS (E3s, 26S proteasome, U-box and BTB/POZ) probably involves in
  affecting pollen germination and tube growth in response to low-temperature stress
  by modulating the activity, localization or stability of different proteins. Additionally,
  Ca2+ gradient, vesicle polarized trafficking as well as cell wall biosynthesis might
  participate in pollen tube elongation under low-temperature stress through the NO
  signaling pathway by CAMTA, PI4K and COBRA-like
