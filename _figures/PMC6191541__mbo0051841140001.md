caption: Aromatic catabolism and gene regulation in R. palustris. (A) Benzoate is
  activated to its CoA thioester by BadA. Hydroxybenzoate can also be converted to
  benzoyl-CoA in multiple steps by HbaA and HbaBC. The benzene ring of benzoyl-CoA
  is reduced by BadDEFG, yielding cyclohex-1,5-ene-carboxyl-CoA, which is further
  reduced by BadJ to cyclohex-1-ene-carboxyl-CoA. The latter is the entry point for
  cyclohexanecarboxylate into the pathway. Cyclohex-1-ene-carboxyl-CoA undergoes a
  ring reduction, ring cleavage, and several β-oxidations to eventually form acetyl-CoA.
  Arrows between cyclohex-1-ene-carboxyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA represent a simplified
  version of enzymatic reactions carried out by BadK, BadH, and BadI. BadA, benzoyl-CoA
  synthetase; HbaA, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA synthetase; HcrABC, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
