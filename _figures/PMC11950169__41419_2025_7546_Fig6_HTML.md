caption: 'A Activation through cell-surface interactions. Without treatment, the catalytic
  activity of GEF-H1 is attenuated by microtubule binding. TTFields exert directional
  forces on microtubules, leading to their disassembly and hence to the release of
  GEF-H1, promoting activation of the GEF-H1/RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, leading
  to the formation of focal adhesions and activation of the downstream target FAK
  (1). This, in turn, leads to activation of the PI3K/AKT axis, with downstream inactivation
  of the pro-apoptotic protein BAD and subsequent cell survival (2). Co-application
  of TTFields with an inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway blocks cell survival signals,
  sensitizing tumor cells to TTFields-induced cell death (3). B Activation through
  cell-cell interactions. Without treatment, N-cadherin forms adherens junctions between
  adjacent cells and triggers PI3K/AKT signaling. Exposure to TTFields potentiates
  multiple homophilic ligations of N-cadherin, thus elevating intercellular N-cadherin
  interactions (1), increasing PI3K/AKT signal amplitude, and augmenting BAD inactivation,
  consequently leading to cell survival (2). Co-application of TTFields with an inhibitor
  of the PI3K/AKT pathway blocks the cell survival signals, sensitizing the tumor
  cells to TTFields-induced cell death (3). Protein phosphorylation sites: GEF-H1,
  Ser886; FAK, Tyr397; PI3K p85, Tyr458; AKT, Ser473; BAD, Ser136'
