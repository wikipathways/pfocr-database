caption: γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis pathway. GABA is synthesized from glutamate
  by glutamic acid decarboxylase in GABAergic neurons. It is then packed into the
  synaptic vesicles by GABA transporter (GAT) and then released into the synapse or
  synaptic cleft by membrane depolarization. Released GABA binds with GABAA and GABAB
  receptors resulting in inhibition of the postsynaptic neuron. In astrocytes, GABA
  is recycled into synaptic vesicles or taken up by mitochondria, where it is metabolized
  by GABA transaminase (GABA-T) to glutamine for neuronal uptake. The figure was created
  using tools obtained from BioRender.com.
