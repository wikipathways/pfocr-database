caption: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and nitric oxide (NO) are generated by enzymatic and
  non-enzymatic pathways. Non-enzymatic production of H2S in the vessels, shown in
  the boxes, has not yet been fully understood. NO is produced by nitrate/nitrite
  pathway which can be enzymatic or non-enzymatic. In endothelial cells, vasoconstrictor
  agonists through phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)/ inositol-3-phosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG) pathways increase [Ca2+]i and cause formation of calcium-calmodulin (CaM).
  CaM stimulates both endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE)
  that generate NO and H2S, respectively. H2S can increase eNOS activity and therefore
  NO production directly or through Akt activation. NO increases CSE activity and
  expression and enhances H2S production. H2S is also produced in periadventitial
  adipose tissue (PAT) by CSE and cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS). Cys, Cysteine;
  HCY, homocysteine; NH3, ammonia; 3-MP, 3-mercaptopyruvate; 3-MST, 3-mercaptopyruvate
  sulfuretransferase; CAT, cysteine aminotransferase; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate.
