caption: Putative model for mechanism of rotavirus NSP1-mediated proviral function.
  The model is based on past (dashed arrows) and present (solid arrows) results, as
  summarized in the Discussion. In brief, stimulation of rotavirus growth may result
  from either subversion of IFN signaling by NSP1 protein, as well as the suppression
  of premature apoptosis by the NSP1-dependent PI3K→Akt→ NF-κB pathway. Both pathways
  may act independently of each other and may also cross talk at one or more steps.
