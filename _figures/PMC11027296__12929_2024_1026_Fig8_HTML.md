caption: 'The potential mechanisms underlying CR Ab-induced thrombosis. (1) CR Abs
  binding to RBD and ACE2 as well as Fc receptors on the surface of neutrophils induce
  signaling pathways. (2) Signaling pathways that regulate IL-8 secretion and NET
  formation are activated: SFK-AMPK signaling mediates IL-8 secretion, while SFK-PI3K-PAD4
  signaling mediates NET formation. The actions of both IL-8 and NETs could be suppressed
  by dasatinib, which is an SFK inhibitor. (3) Secreted IL-8 and NETs subsequently
  cause (4) the secretion of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β from PBMCs, (5) enhanced expression
  of surface P-selectin on platelets, and (6) increased endothelial permeability.
  These processes collectively contribute to the eventual formation of thrombi. CR
