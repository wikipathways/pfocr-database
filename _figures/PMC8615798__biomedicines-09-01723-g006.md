caption: XOR deficiency and the biosynthetic pathway of Moco. The classifications
  of the types of Moco and XOR deficiency is shown on the left and right, respectively.
  Enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of Moco are shown in red. Mutations causing
  Moco deficiency have been identified in the genes MOCS1 (type A), MOCS2 or MOCS3
  (type B), and rarely in GPHN (type C). The domain structures of SO, AO, and XOR
  and the final maturity of Moco are shown. The atoms coordinating to Mo are shown
  in the purple boxes.
