caption: A possible mechanism for the inhibitory effect of p66Shc on mitogenic signaling.
  Upon growth factor, e.g., EGF, stimulation, p66Shc competes with p52Shc/p46Shc isoforms
  for binding to the limited cellular pool of Grb2 and seizes the Grb2/SOS complex,
  but is unable to recruit SOS. Subsequently, serine 36 (S36) phosphorylation of p66Shc
  following tyrosine phosphorylation uncouples the association of p66Shc·Grb2 complex
  from EGFR via forming the nonproductive complex with Grb2, and thus may result in
  the dominant negative inhibition of p52Shc/p46Shc-mediated Ras-MAPK pathway
