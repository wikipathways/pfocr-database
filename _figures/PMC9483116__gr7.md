caption: 'A working model for the positive regulatory roles of UBP12/UBP13 during
  BR signaling.BR signaling triggers import of pBES1 (the inactive form) into the
  nucleus where it becomes dephosphorylated by nuclear-localized PP2A (). Both forms
  of BES1 are polyubiquitinated by various E3 ligases (SINATs, COP1, etc.), targeting
  them for degradation by 26S proteasomes. However, polyubiquitinated BES1 and pBES1
  can be rescued from destruction by the deubiquitinases UBP12/UBP13, which stabilize
  and increase cytosolic and nuclear BES1 and pBES1 levels. The active BES1 transcription
  factor activates downstream genes SAUR-AC1 and ASC5, resulting in cell elongation.
  Concurrently, BES1 represses the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes CPD and
  DWF4. Recently,  reported that UBP12/UBP13 can directly deubiquitinate the BRI1 protein.
  Deubiquitination of BRI1 limits vacuole targeting of BRI1 through the multivesicular
  body (MVB) pathway and degradation. Polyubiquitinated BES1/BZR1 can also be removed
  by selective autophagy (; ). Consequently, UBP12/UBP13 regulate BR signaling in
  at least two sites: the top and the bottom of the pathway.'
