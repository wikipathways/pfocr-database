caption: Mutational activation of KRAS is found in >90% of PDA and contributes to
  tumor initiation and progression of the disease. PDA is almost universally fatal
  due to late-stage at diagnosis and intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapy
  and radiation. Data from Collisson and colleagues suggests that activation of BRAF
  (highlighted in red) is sufficient to recapitulate the tumor initiation and progression
  seen with activated KRAS in mouse and human PDA. These data imply that targeting
  RAF/MEK/ERK signaling downstream of KRAS may be of clinical utility in PDA. Treatment
  with MEK inhibitors is associated with a reciprocal increase in AKT activity and
  MEK inhibitor based combinatorial approaches will be needed to induce durable tumor
  regressions. Selective inhibitors of RAF (Vemurafinib, Dabrafenib) and MEK (Trametinib)
  kinases have recently been shown to prolong survival in patients with BRAFV600E
  mutant melanomas. Selective inhibitors of RAF induce a paradoxical activation of
  ERK signaling in KRAS mutant tumors whereas MEK inhibitors downregulate ERK pathway
  activity irrespective of tumor genotype.
