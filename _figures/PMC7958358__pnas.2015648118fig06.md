caption: Multiprotein assembly proposed for signaling through the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  pathway. Complexes involving Ras (green), Raf-RBD (blue), and Galectin dimers (beige)
  at the membrane would promote protein network that result in synchronized activation
  for signal amplification and kinetic proofreading. The Raf-CRD and the serine/threonine
  rich region that follows, situated before the kinase domain (residues 132 to 340
  in CRaf), are indicated by a blue line connecting the RBD to the kinase domain.
  The composite figure was made with structures for HRas/CRaf-RBD (PDB ID 4G0N), the
  Galectin-1 dimer (PDB ID 3W58), and the Raf-kinase domain dimer (PDB ID 3OMV).
