caption: 1) cGAS is activated by dsDNA in the cytosol and catalyzes the synthesis
  of cGAMP from ATP and GTP. 2) cGAMP binding induces the oligomerization of STING
  at the ER or Golgi membranes. 3) TBK1 is recruited to the STING oligomers via its
  C-terminal PLPLRT/SD motif and activated by induced proximity in trans. Phosphorylation
  of STING by TBK1 increases the binding affinity between TBK1 and STING and facilitates
  further recruitment and activation of TBK1. 4) Activated TBK1 phosphorylates STING
  at the pLxIS motif, allowing it to recruit IRF-3 to the signaling complex. 5) The
  proximity of TBK1 and IRF-3 bound to adjacent STING molecules within the cGAMP-STING
  oligomer causes the phosphorylation of the pLxIS motif of IRF-3. 6) Phosphorylated
  IRF-3 dissociates from STING, oligomerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and initiates
  the transcription of IFN-β gene.
