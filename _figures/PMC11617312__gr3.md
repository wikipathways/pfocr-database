caption: Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling in epithelial homeostasis and HPV-modulated
  homeostasis. A) Signalling cells secrete canonical Wnt ligands, such as Wnt3a, to
  activate the Wnt/β-catenin signalling which promotes self-renewal and inhibits differentiation
  in stem cells. Non-canonical Wnt5a ligand and tumour suppressor NHERF1 bind to Frizzled,
  thereby inhibiting Wnt3a-dependent LRP phosphorylation and inhibiting accumulation
  of β-catenin. Inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling has been reported to induce
  epithelial cell differentiation [79,82,85]. B) HPVs use E6 and E7 to increase canonical
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling. i) High-risk E6-dependent degradation of p53 prevents
  the transcriptional activation of ubiquitin ligase Siah-1 which degrades β-catenin;
  ii) High and low-risk E6 cooperate with E6AP to degrade NHERF1 which subsequently
  activates the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway; iii) High-risk E7 increases the
  accumulation of phosphorylated NHERF1 which is preferentially targeted by E6 for
  degradation [89,90,94]. C) Table summarizes the interactions of Wnt components,
  including Siah-1 and NHERF1, with Alpha- and Beta- HPV E6 and E7
