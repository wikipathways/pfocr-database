caption: Two-loop model of iADE. Ligation of FcγR by infectious DENV-subneutralizing
  antibody complex induces suppression of innate immune responses by (i) upregulation
  of negative regulators of pathogen pattern recognition, DAK, Atg5 to Atg12, SARM,
  and TANK, which subsequently abolish expression of RLR and TLRs and its signaling
  pathway, resulting in decreased type 1 interferon and proinflammatory cytokine production,
  which serves to suppress interferon-mediated antiviral responses, and (ii) early
  activation of IL-10. IL-10 potently activates the SOCS system, suppressing the JAK/STAT
  signaling pathway and, in turn, the interferon-signaling pathway. IL-10 is known
  to promote a type Th2 cytokine response, resulting in Th2-type cytokine biasing.
  These two loops of suppression switch off intracellular antiviral responses in DENV-infected
  cells under iADE conditions, resulting in the production of high numbers of infectious
  virions. Tyk2, tyrosine kinase 2; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element;
  OAS, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthase; PKR, protein kinase R; ISGs, interferon-stimulated
  genes; GAS, gamma interferon-activated sequence; PGE2, prostaglandin E2.
