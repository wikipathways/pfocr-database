caption: Schematic diagram showing that the protective effects of nebivolol on Ang
  II-induced signaling are partially blunted by inhibition of eNOS and AMPK. NO production
  via the agonistic activation of β3-AR/AMPK/eNOS pathway by nebivolol is required
  for its inhibitory effects on Ang II-induced ROS generation and activation of proinflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF-α and iNOS. On the contrary, inhibitory effects of nebivolol
  on Ang II-mediated mTORC1 signaling and hypertrophic response are completely independent
  of NO bioavailability.
