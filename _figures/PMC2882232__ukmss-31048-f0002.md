caption: 'A simplified representation of oncogenic signaling cascades in pancreatic
  cancer. a ∣ Binding of ligands to receptors for integrins, VEGF, EGFR, CCK-B/gastrin,
  HGF and IGF-I activates signaling cascades including the PI3K–Akt and Ras pathways,
  which affect downstream targets such as NFκB, mTOR and MAPK. FADK binds to integrin
  receptors and Src to growth factor receptors. FADK–Src interaction increases the
  activity of FADK. PTEN has the opposite effect to PI3K and inhibits the Akt pathway.
  Proteasomes degrade IκB, which normally inhibits NFκB. b ∣ Binding of TGF-β forms
  a complex with TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, which leads to phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3.
  These proteins form a complex with SMAD4, which migrates to the nucleus to activate
  gene transcription. c ∣ The embryonic signaling pathways. Binding of hedgehog proteins
  to PTC1 releases inhibition of SMO, which leads to activation of downstream targets
  such as GLI 1. Activation of Notch by its ligands Delta and Jagged leads to its
  proteolytic cleavage by γ-secretase, and releases the cytoplasmic domain which translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to transcription factors such as CSL. β-catenin is normally
  destined for proteasomal degradation. In the canonical Wnt–β-catenin pathway, binding
  of Wnt proteins stabilizes β-catenin and induces its translocation to the nucleus.
  β-catenin forms a complex with the TCF–LEF transcription factors to initiate gene
  expression. Abbreviation: CD, cytoplasmic domain.'
