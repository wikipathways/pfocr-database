caption: Diagram of the main posttranslational modification events involved in the
  activation of response to ICLs. Once the ICL is detected it triggers the ATR/Chk1
  pathway leading to the phosphorylation of several components of the FA core complex.
  ATR and potentially other kinases phosphorylate FANCI and FANCD2 (1) priming the
  complex for its monoubiquitination. These phosphorylation events lead then to the
  monoubiquitination of the FANCD2/FANCI complex by FANCL/UBE2T (2), which promotes
  its recruitment onto chromatin and the action of the effector proteins. On the other
  hand, the dosage of the FANCD2/FANCI complex on chromatin can be regulated through
  SUMOylation-dependent polyubiquitination mediated by PIAS1/4, UBC9 and RNF4 (3,
  4). Finally, these events can be reversed by the action of a hypothetical deubiquitinase
  (5), SENP6 (6), the deubiquitinating enzyme USP1/UAF1 complex (7) as well as putative
  phosphatases (8) still unidentified
