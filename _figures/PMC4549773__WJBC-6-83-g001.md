caption: Overview of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication cycle. Steps
  in the viral replication cycle are numbered. The steps where FDA approved drugs
  exist are marked in blue. (1) The trimeric envelope glycoprotein (gp120/gp41) of
  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) binds to the CD4 receptor and CCR5 co-receptors
  present on host cell surface. Maraviroc, a CCR5 receptor antagonist blocks the binding
  of viral gp120 to CCR5 and prevents the entry of virus into cells; (2) Viral membrane
  fuses with cellular membrane allowing the entry of the virus into the cytoplasm.
  Enfuvirtide, a fusion inhibitor binds to gp41 and prevents the formation of an entry
  pore for the capsid of the virus, thus blocking the entry of virus into the cytoplasm;
  (3) The virus undergoes uncoating of the core; (4) HIV RNA is reverse-transcribed
  by reverse transcriptase into double stranded DNA within the core. Reverse-transcriptase
  inhibitors block the synthesis of viral DNA; (5) Integrase (IN) cleaves two nucleotides
  adjacent to conserved CA nucleotides from both 3’-ends of viral DNA (referred as
  3’-processing in text) and forms the preintegration complex (PIC). The PIC is transported
  into the nucleus through a cellular nuclear import pathway. IN strand transfer inhibitors
  (INSTIs) bind to the IN-DNA complex after 3’-processing rendering the cytoplasmic
  PIC defective for integration but not nuclear transport; (6) IN facilitates the
  joining of viral DNA to the host DNA (termed strand transfer in text). Integrated
  viral DNA is referred to as “provirus”. A cellular protein, lens-epithelium derived
  growth factor (LEDGF/p75), preferentially targets the integration of viral DNA within
  transcriptionally active regions. INSTIs block the joining of processed viral DNA
  ends into cellular DNA; (7) The viral DNA is transcribed by cellular RNA pol II
  into viral RNAs; (8) Full-length and alternatively spliced RNAs are transported
  out of nucleus; (9) Viral proteins are synthesized from the RNA template; (10) Full-length
  viral RNA and newly synthesized proteins begin the assembly of new virus particles
  at the inner surface of cell membrane; (11) Immature viral particles bud out of
  the membrane and released (12); and (13) Proteolytic processing of viral proteins
  results in the maturation of viral particle. Protease inhibitors block the formation
  of mature proteins by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins.
