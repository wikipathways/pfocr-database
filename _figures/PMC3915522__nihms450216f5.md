caption: Ras proteins function as nucleotide-driven switches that relay extracellular
  cues to cytoplasmic signalling cascades. The binding of GTP to Ras proteins locks
  them in their active states, which enables high affinity interactions with downstream
  targets that are called effectors. Subsequently, a slow intrinsic GTPase activity
  cleaves off the γ-phosphate, leading to Ras functional inactivation and thus the
  termination of signalling. This on–off cycle is tightly controlled by GTPase-activating
  proteins (GAPs) and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GAPs, such as p120GAP
  or neurofibromin (NF1), enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity and hence negatively
  regulate Ras protein function. Conversely, GEFs (also known as GTP-releasing proteins/factors,
  termed GRPs or GRFs), such as RasGRF and son of sevenless (SOS), catalyse nucleotide
  ejection and therefore facilitate GTP binding and protein activation. The classical
  view of Ras signalling depicts Ras activation and recruitment to the plasma membrane
  following receptor Tyr kinase (RTK) stimulation by growth factors (GF). Activated
  Ras engages effector molecules — belonging to multiple effector families — that
  initiate several signal-transduction cascades. Outputs shown represent the main
  thrusts of the indicated pathways. Ras activation can also occur in endomembrane
  compartments, namely the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi. Activating mutations
  in the different components of the Ras–Raf–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway are associated with the indicated developmental disorders, suggesting that
  MAPK-signal antagonism might be a rational approach to manage certain cardio-facio-cutaneous
  (CFC) syndromes. AF-6, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia-1 fused gene on chromosome
