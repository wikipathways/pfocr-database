caption: 'Nectin-4 signaling in normal and malignant cells. (a) In normal cells, Nectin-4
  is localized at adherens junctions, where it interacts with afadin and F-actin to
  maintain cell–cell adhesion. This interaction is crucial for maintaining epithelial
  integrity. (b) In malignant cells, Nectin-4 undergoes ectodomain shedding, triggered
  by hypoxia-induced activation of ADAM-17. The released soluble Nectin-4 ectodomain
  interacts with CXCR4 on lymphatic endothelial cells or integrin β on vascular endothelial
  cells, promoting tumor progression. Specifically, CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling activates
  the AKT1 pathway in lymphatic endothelial cells, driving cell growth and migration.
  In vascular endothelial cells, Nectin-4 ectodomain binding initiates the Src/PI3K/AKT/eNOS
  pathway, enhancing NO production and angiogenesis. Furthermore, in cancer cells,
  hypoxia and the activation of ADAM-17 contribute to enhanced base excision repair
  and tumor cell survival, highlighting Nectin-4’s multifaceted role in oncogenesis
  and metastasis. Nectin-4, expressed in cancer cells, binds to TIGIT, which is primarily
  expressed in T cells and NK cells. Upon binding, this interaction triggers inhibitory
  signals through the ITT-like and ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
  motif) domains in the cytoplasmic region of TIGIT. These inhibitory signals suppress
  T cell and NK cell activation, thereby facilitating immune evasion by cancer cells.Source:
