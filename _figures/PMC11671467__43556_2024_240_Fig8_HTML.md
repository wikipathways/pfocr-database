caption: The Role of EGCG in Diabetes Management. Showing the pivotal role of EGCG
  in diabetes, particularly through its interaction with the KEAP1-Nrf2 signaling
  pathway. EGCG forms a hybrid complex with glutathione (GSH), which binds to KEAP1,
  resulting in the dissociation of KEAP1 from Nrf2. This dissociation allows Nrf2
  to translocate into the nucleus, where it initiates the transcription of crucial
  antioxidant proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase
  1 (NQO1). These antioxidant proteins play an important role in reducing oxidative
  stress and inflammation, key contributors to diabetic complications
