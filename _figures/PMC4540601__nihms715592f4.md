caption: Differences in M1- versus M2-macrophage fueling reactions. In response to
  inflammatory stimuli, M1-macrophages upregulate a pathway known as aerobic glycolysis.
  This involves the import of glucose through GLUT-1 and its phosphorylation by Hexokinase-1
  (HK-1). The resulting glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) can be shuttled through the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) for NADPH generation, which fuels immune radical production,
  including nitric oxide (NO). At the same time, G6P is also oxidized to pyruvate
  (PYR) for ATP synthesis, and this PYR is primarily reduced to lactate (LAC) to conserve
  redox balance. Very little PYR enters the Krebs cycle as acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) due
  to the phosphorylation and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Genes activated/
  repressed by HIF-1α are depicted as green/red. Upon stimulation with anti-inflammatory
  stimuli, M2-macrophages adopt an oxidative metabolism involving the import of free
  fatty acids and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-associated lipids (fatty acids and
  LDL) by CD36. These fatty acids are linked to carnitine and shuttled to the mitochondria
  for β-oxidation, yielding ATP. In addition, some of the Ac-CoA is reused to synthesize
  new fatty acids. Rather than using tissue arginine for NO-production, these cells
  use the amino acid for proline and polyamine production, the former of which is
  critical for collagen synthesis. Features activated/repressed by PPAR-γ are depicted
  in green/red. doi:10.1128 /microbiolspec.MBP-0004-2014.f4
