caption: In the presence of ANKRD11, Histone H3 and p53 are acetylated in the promoter
  regions of dendrite-associated genes such as Trkb, which results in transcription
  of the genes. Increased Trkb expression activates TrkB signaling leading to the
  growth and arborization of cortical dendrites. In the absence of ANKRD11, Hisone
  H3 acetylation is suppressed. Gene expression repressors including MeCP2 and DNMT1
  accumulate on dendrite-associated gene promoters and suppress expression of the
  genes. Thereby, dendritic outgrowth and arborization are inhibited via decreased
  TrkB signaling.
