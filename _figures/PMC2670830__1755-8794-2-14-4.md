caption: 'Signaling in pterygium. Schematic representation of potential signaling
  pathways involved in primary pterygium. These pathways could be affected in conjunctival
  epithelial cells, fibroblasts or vascular endothelial cells. Pathways were identified
  by incorporating the microarray results (genes which were differentially expressed
  between normal conjunctival and pterygium tissue) into Pathway Studio. Green symbols
  represent down-regulation, whereas red symbols represent up-regulation of genes.
  Solid lines represent positive regulation, thin arrow with a cross line represent
  inhibition. Purple symbols represent intermediate molecules in the potential pathways
  that may have altered function, for example, CDKN1A or p21 (Cip) may have reduced
  function due to down-regulated egr1 transcription factor. GP75: Tyrosinase-related
  protein 1, CSTA: cystatin A, TAGLN: transgelin, GJA1: Gap junction protein α-1 or
  Connexin-43, ABCA1: ATP binding cassette subfamily A1 protein, CEL: carboxyl ester
  lipase, DUSP1: dual specificity phosphatase I, PMAIP1: phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
  protein 1, BTG2: B cell translocation gene 2, CYP26A1: cytochrome P450 family 26
  A1 isoform, NR4A1 and 4A2: nuclear receptors 4A1 and 2, SPARC: secreted protein
  acidic rich in cysteine, TGM-2: transglutaminase 2, TFPI-2: Tissue factor pathway
  inhibitor 2 and IGFBP3: insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3. Green symbols
  within the nucleus represent transcription factors genes that were depressed, probably
  due to the upstream stress signaling such as those related to ultraviolet light
  (not shown). Due to quenching effect, there may be an increased in the transcriptional
  promoter activity of other transcription factors such as SP1, CEBP and SP3 (open
  symbols).'
