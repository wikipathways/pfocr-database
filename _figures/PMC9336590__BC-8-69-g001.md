caption: 'Regulation of PH on gluconeogenesis through HIF-1α/XBP-1/FoxO1. Gluconeogenesis
  is a multistep metabolic process that generates glucose from pyruvate or a related
  three-carbon compound (lactate, alanine). Conversion of pyruvate to PEP via oxaloacetate,
  catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase and PEP carboxy kinase is one of the irreversible
  steps in the gluconeogenic pathway. HIF-1α regulation and XBP-1-FoxO Signal play
  the key roles in gluconeogenic activity through PCKs. HIF: Hypoxia-inducible factor,
  XBP-1: X-box binding protein 1, FoxO: Forkhead box O, PEP: Phosphoenolpyruvate,
  PH: Pharmacological hypothermia, ROS: Reactive oxygen species, OAA: Oxaloacetate,
  PCK: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, ER: Endoplasmic reticulum'
