caption: Putative cone-specific retinoid (visual) cycle. This metabolic pathway is
  postulated to involve enzymes located in cone photoreceptor and Müller glial cells.
  The proposed direct isomerization of all-trans-retinol into 11-cis-retinol is a
  key difference between this pathway and the canonical retinoid cycle.
