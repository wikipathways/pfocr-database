caption: The 5-HT receptors are divided into 7 families (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4,
  5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5- HT7) that comprise 15 receptor subtypes. The receptors involved
  in the nociceptive pathway are 5-HT1, 5- HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT7. 5-HT1 is coupled
  to the G i/o protein and it reduces levels of cAMP generating anti and pronociceptive
  effects. 5-HT2 is coupled to the G q/11 protein and its activation leads to an increase
  of IP3 and DG levels, generating an antinociceptive effect. 5-HT3 is the only one
  that is not coupled to a G protein; instead this receptor is a ligand-gated cation
  channel, when activated 5-HT3 depolarizes the neuronal membrane and causes antinociception
  but also 5-HT3 can maintain the painful stimulus. 5.HT7 is coupled to G s protein,
  its activation generates an increase in the cAMP levels causing pro and antinociceptive
  effects.
