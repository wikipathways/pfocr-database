caption: Myocardial injury activated the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway that disrupted the
  ACE/ACE2 ratio and further imbalanced ACE-Ang II-AT1R and ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas axes,
  including increases in ACE, Ang II, and AT1R and decreases in ACE2, Ang(1-7) and
  Mas. Moreover, increasing Ang II and decreasing Ang(1-7) synergistically inhibited
  LXR-α expression. Consequently, the decrease in LXR-α further activated the AT1R/p38
  MAPK pathway. This signalling created a positive feedback loop that amplified AT1R/p38
  MAPK signalling, thereby disrupting the RAS balance and inducing cardiac fibrosis.
  Interestingly, PFD activated LXR-α expression, inhibited the AT1R/p38 MAPK pathway,
  and balanced the RAS in this rat model of cardiac fibrosis.
