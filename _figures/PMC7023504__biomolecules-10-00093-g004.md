caption: Mitochondrial signaling in skeletal muscle during exercise. During exercise
  cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration rises leading to activation of calcium-calmodulin-dependent
  kinase (CaMK) and increase in mitochondrial respiration, and subsequent increase
  in ATP and ROS production. While Ca2+ acts via CaMK, the AMP/ATP ratio stimulates
  the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and mitochondrial ROS target the
  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). All signals are then integrated
  in the increase of transcriptional activity of the master regulator of mitochondrial
  biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC1α).
