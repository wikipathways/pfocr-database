caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of genes positively regulated by unliganded GR.
  IPA identified this hub as a top signaling network among candidate genes downregulated
  in EPH-4 shGR-19 compared to EV-50 (IPA network score = 41) i.e. positively regulated
  by GR. This network was associated with dermatological diseases and conditions,
  inflammatory disease, and neurological disease. Annotation of IPA network shapes
  and molecular relationships as specified in Figure .

  as a regulator of gene expression in mammary epithelial cells.
