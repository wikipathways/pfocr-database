caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways. The canonical pathway
  is a two-step process: first, the NF-kB pathway activates the expression of pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18; then activation of the inflammasome (e.g., NLRP3) is required (e.g.,
  by K+ efflux or by ROS) to activate caspase1. In the non-canonical pathway, the
  activation of caspase11 by intracellular inducers leads to the generation of Gasdermin-Nterm
  (GSDMD-Nterm), which translocates to the membrane and creates pores that allow the
  efflux of K+ and the release of mature cytokines. See text for details. Components
  of the pathway that are increased in epilepsy are in blue. Caspase 11 (i), inactive
  form. Pointed arrows define the direction of the signaling pathways. Wide grey arrow
  indicate transcriptional regulation.'
