caption: Recognition of foreign or tumor antigens normally results in the activation
  of CD8 T cells, leading to the killing of viruses or bacteria or the lysis of tumor
  cells. The programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor is a cell membrane protein present
  on the surface of CD8 T cells, which, upon interacting with PD-L1 and PD-L2 on the
  surface of tumor cells, results in the suppression of the cytotoxic immune response,
  leading to tumor escape.IFN, interferon; IL-2, interleukin-2; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1, programmed death ligand-1; TCR, T-cell
  receptor.
