caption: The mammalian SREBP pathway. When sterol levels are sufficient, the SREBP-SCAP
  complex is retained at the ER membrane due to SCAP interaction with Insig. When
  sterol levels are reduced, SCAP transports SREBPs from the ER to the Golgi apparatus,
  where SREBP undergoes two sequential proteolytic cleavages by S1P and S2P. First,
  S1P (subtilisin-related serine protease) cleaves SREBP at the hydrophilic loop projected
  into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and then, S2P (metallopeptidase) cuts SREBP
  within the first transmembrane segment. This releases the N-terminal domain of SREBP
  (bHLH-Zip), which enters the nucleus and binds to a SRE in the enhancer/promoter
  region of target genes activating their transcription.
