caption: Cell death pathways triggered by the temozolomide-induced DNA lesion O6-methylguanine.
  Although TMZ, like other SN1 alkylators, induces more than a dozen DNA adducts,
  O6MeG is the key cytotoxic lesion and MGMT the primary node of drug resistance (reviewed
  in Reference []). The damage is converted into DSBs and, in p53 mutated cells, stimulates
  mitochondrial apoptosis, a hallmark of which is Bcl-2 decline []. In p53 wild-type
  cells, apoptosis is additionally driven by death receptor triggered caspase-8 activation,
  which requires upregulation of the Fas receptor controlled by p53 [], and the Fas
  ligand, which is under control of AP-1. Additionally, the AP-1 dependent BIM/BAX
  apoptosis pathway [], as well as the SIAH1/HIPK2-p53Ser46 pathway become activated
  [] thus contributing to cell death executed by apoptosis. The model is based on
  experiments with TMZ doses of ≤50 µM, which were used for glioblastoma cell treatment
  in the cited works.
