caption: Model of the “cross-talk” between purinergic receptors during the uridine
  triphosphate (UTP)-mediated control of Leishmania amazonensis infection. We propose
  a model whereby UTP induces the control of L. amazonensis infection by a “cross-talk”
  between P2Y2 and P2X7 receptors, activated by eUTP and eATP. During L. amazonensis
  infection, P2Y2,4 and P2X7 are upregulated in macrophages (1), which allows eATP
  and eUTP to activate an important mechanism of infection control via P2 receptors.
  Initially, lower levels of eATP and eUTP [damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)]
  activate the P2Y2 receptor (1) and stimulate its Gq coupled protein (G) (2), activating
  the phospholipase C—IP3 (PLC, phosphatidil-inositol 1–3 phosphate) pathway (3) that
  modulates calcium (Ca++) release from the endoplasmic reticulum (4). We suggest
  that eATP and eUTP potentiate ATP release via P2Y2 activation, triggering further
  phospholipase C and Ca++ mobilization, which recruits PANX-1 channels that releasing
  more DAMPs such as adenosine triphosphate (5), acting mainly via P2Y2 and P2X7 signaling
  (6, 7). The combined innate response of both P2 receptors triggers reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and NO production (12), and activation of the enzyme 5-LO further
  culminates in LTB4 production (9, 10, 11) and IL-1β secretion, in an NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent
  manner (11). During chronic infection with L. amazonensis, the mediators mentioned
  above help to induce helper T lymphocytes such as Th1 and Th17 cells, which produce
  IFN-γ and IL-17 to further activate anti-leishmanial mechanism in phagocytes (such
  as NO and ROS production). Thus, P2Y and P2X activation cooperate in boosting immune
  responses against L. amazonensis. Black arrows indicate pathways supported by data
  in this paper; dotted black arrows represent potential pathways (based on data from
  other systems) and red arrows represent pathways supported by data from previous
  studies.
