caption: Regulation of histamine synthesis by the post-translational processing of
  mouse HDC. HDC is initially translated as the precursor form, with a molecular weight
  of 74-kDa (74-kDa HDC). Since HDC lacks the canonical signal sequence at its N-terminus,
  HDC appears to be post-translationally targeted to the ER in an unidentified manner.
  One of the processing enzymes that are responsible for the post-translational processing
  of HDC was found to be caspase-9. The 53-kDa form of HDC is localized mainly in
  the granule fraction and possesses higher enzymatic activity. On the other hand,
  the 74-kDa form of HDC undergoes degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.
  Histamine is synthesized in the cytosol and transported into the granules by vesicular
  monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2). Stored histamine is released from the granules
  upon various stimuli, such as IgE-mediated antigen stimulation in mast cells. Excess
  amounts of histamine might be exported through organic cation transporter-3 (OCT3),
  which is known to be a transporter for organic cations with low affinity but high
  capacity. The 74-kDa HDC is the dominant form in the cells lacking histamine granules,
  such as macrophages, whereas the 53-kDa HDC is detected in the granule-containing
  cells, such as mast cells and neutrophils.
