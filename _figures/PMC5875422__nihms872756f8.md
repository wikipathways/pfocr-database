caption: Schematic shows the relationship between neuronal and oligodendrocyte metabolism.
  Potential signaling pathways mediated by NAA in oligodendrocytes. NAA is synthesized
  from aspartate and acetyl-CoA in neuronal mitochondria by the enzyme NAT8L. It is
  catabolized in oligodendrocytes by ASPA into aspartate and acetate. The resulting
  acetate can be converted to acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm which is incorporated into
  myelin lipids (pathway shown by dotted lines). However, our data suggest the existence
  of a novel signaling pathway. In this pathway (shown by bold arrows), the products
  of NAA catabolism enter the TCA cycle and signal to the nucleus of oligodendrocytes.
  Acetate can be converted to acetyl-CoA and incorporated into lipids which can be
  oxidized to generate acetyl-CoA in mitochondria which then can enter the TCA cycle.
  Aspartate (L-Asp) can be converted to oxaloacetate by aspartate dehydrogenase and
  can also enter the TCA cycle. These products then alter levels of TCA cycle intermediates
  including α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). TCA cycle intermediates and metabolites measured
  including aspartate, citrate/isocitrate, α-KG, succinate, fumarate, and malate are
  shown. Increased α-KG can regulate histone demethylases resulting in changes in
  methylation of histone H3 which can then lead to changes in chromatin conformation
  and gene expression
