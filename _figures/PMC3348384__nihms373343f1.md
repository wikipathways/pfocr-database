caption: The figure illustrates the steps in the processing of miRNA, also summarized
  in the text. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II into primary-miRNAs (pri-miRNAs)
  that are processed into precursor-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) by the Drosha microprocessor
  complex which includes DGCR8. The DEAD-box RNA helicases p68 and p72 are components
  of the Drosha complex. Pre-miRNAs are recognized by exportin-5 and Ran-GTP with
  GTP hydrolysis allowing export to the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are
  processed by the Dicer complex to mature ~22 nt miRNA. The TRBP/PACT complex interacts
  with and stabilizes Dicer, and transfers miRNA to Argonaute proteins (Ago1, Ago2,
  Ago3, and Ago4) in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). miRNA guides the RISC
  complex to target mRNAs by binding to the 3′ UTR or the ORF and represses translation.
  The silenced mRNA is directed to the P-bodies for degradation. Interactions of ERα
  with Drosha, p68, and p77; regulation of Ago2 and Dicer; and possible regulation
  by nongenomic E2signaling (------) are indicated.
