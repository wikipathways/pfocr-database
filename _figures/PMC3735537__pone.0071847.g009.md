caption: 'The time of peak of rhythms in transcript levels of genes associated with
  sucrose and starch metabolism was identified in a schematic metabolic pathway. Each
  circle corresponds to a specific gene model. Metabolic pathways were colored according
  to the median of the phase of their constitutive genes. The time of peak of probes
  associated with starch and sucrose synthesis pathways was between ZT20 and ZT4,
  while the time of the peak of probes associate to sucrose and starch degradation
  was between ZT8 to ZT16. Genes that were not circadian (n. c.) were in gray. Rhythmic
  with a time of peak at ZT0 are in yellow, ZT4 in dark orange, ZT8 in red, ZT12 in
  blue, ZT16 in dark blue and ZT20 in light blue. Enzymes for sucrose synthesis are:
  (1) sucrose-phosphate synthase; (2) sucrose phosphatase; (3) sucrose synthase; (4)
  neutral invertase; (5) hexokinase; (6) fructokinase; (7) glucose-6-phosphate isomerase;
  (8) phosphoglucomutase; (9) UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase . Abbreviations: S6P –
  sucrose 6-phosphate; UDP-G - UDP-glucose; G1P – glucose 1-phosphate; G6P – glucose
  6-phosphate; F6P – fructose 6-phosphate; ADP-G – ADP-glucose; 3P glycerate – 3-phospho
  glycerate.'
