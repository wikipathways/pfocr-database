caption: (A) Metabolic network map displays the 2D 1H-13C-HSQC time zero absolute
  metabolite concentration differences between M. smegmatis wild type mc2155 and alr
  insertion mutant TAM23 grown in MADC media and treated at mid exponential phase
  with [13C2]-D-alanine. A positive blue bar indicates a concentration increase in
  mc2155 relative to TAM23. A negative red bar indicates a concentration decrease
  in mc2155 relative to TAM23. The plotted concentrations are on a µM scale and the
  error bars represent standard deviations. Metabolites highlighted in magenta exhibited
  a reversal in concentration depending on whether media were supplemented with or
  without D-alanine from the 1D 1H NMR experiments and . L-alanine dehydrogenase (ALD),
  highlighted in red, was overexpressed in TAM23 relative to mc2155. The dark arrows
  identify the primary carbon flux pathway, blue arrows represent a hypothetical pathway
  for D-alanine biosynthesis that is depicted in detail in (B), and the dotted lines
  represent established alternative routes. (B) Metabolic network summarizing the
  1D 1H NMR data and the L-D amino acid pools (see  and ) comparing mc2155 with TAM23
  from cultures without supplemental D-alanine. Metabolites colored blue were observed
  to increase in mc2155 relative to TAM23. Diagram adapted from Halouska et al. 2014.
