caption: 'Overview of the role of TPC2 in cancer-related processes. The TPC2/NAADP/Ca2+signaling
  pathway has been implicated in proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, invasion, migration,
  autophagy, and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Several TPC2 pharmacological inhibitors,
  including tetrandrine, verapamil, Ned-19 and naringenin, have been demonstrated
  to inhibit these cancer-related processes in vitro and in vivo. VEGF: vascular endothelial
  growth factor; VEGFR2: vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2'
