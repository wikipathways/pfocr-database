caption: Brief schematic diagram of Ca2+/CaN/NFAT signalling pathway. Each globular
  domain of CaM has a pair of Ca2+ binding sequences, CaM exposes a hydrophobic surface
  after binding Ca2+. CaN is composed of catalytic subunit (CnA) and regulatory subunit
  (CnB). CnB is capable to bind Ca2+, CnA contains phosphatase domain (catalytic domain),
  CnB binding domain, CaM binding domain and autoinhibitory domain, the CaM binding
  domain can be combined with the hydrophobic surface of CaM and be regulated by it.
  In the resting state, autoinhibitory domain covers the phosphatase domain, the binding
  of Ca2+ with CnB and CaM/CaM with CnA make autoinhibitory domain separate itself
  from phosphatase domain, and CaN is then activated. Activated CaN dephosphorylates
  the serine residues of the NFAT regulatory domain, exposing the nuclear localization
  sequence, thereby promoting its transfer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and
  acting as a transcription factor in the nucleus to further cause the transcription
  of NFAT‐dependent genes
