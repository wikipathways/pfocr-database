caption: The overview of lipid pathway analysis based on the results of this study.
  Possible disturbed metabolic pathways of the potential biomarkers for GLU, NFM and
  FFM. Red and yellow color boxes indicated increased and decreased lipid classes
  during the three hours of dairy milk intervention, respectively, in both NFM and
  FFM groups. The green color box indicates the decreased level of lipids at 90 min
  and the increased level of lipids at 180 min in both NFM and FFM groups. Lipids
  without boxes are intermediates that were not detected but were used as background
  for enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database.
