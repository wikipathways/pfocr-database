caption: 'Upstream Pathway of Triterpenoid Synthesis in C. paliurus. Solid lines indicate
  pathways where differential genes have been identified in the transcriptome analysis,
  while dotted lines represent pathways without identified differential genes. The
  colored blocks next to each enzyme represent the FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of
  transcript per Million mapped reads) values of the corresponding genes, with expression
  levels shown from August to November. The color gradient moves from blue (lower
  expression) to red (higher expression), illustrating the dynamic expression of genes
  involved in the triterpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Gene name abbreviation: acetyl-CoA
  acyltransferase (ACAT), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthetase (HMGS), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
