caption: Tumor-associated MDSCs are the predominant suppliers of IL-10. The immunoregulatory
  effect of MDSCs and associated anti-inflammatory cytokines trigger the induction
  of the SHIP signaling pathway by cancers. This pathway is interlinked with the PI3K
  signaling pathway, which suppresses anticancer responses and promotes cancer progression
  via immune evasion. IL-10 also induces the anti-inflammatory effect of macrophages,
  thus potentially initiating their polarization into cancer-favoring M2 macrophages.
  Downregulated SHIP expression has also been shown to induce apoptosis in neutrophils
  needed for the destruction of cancer cells.
