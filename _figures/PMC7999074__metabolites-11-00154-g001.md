caption: The Hippo signaling pathway comprises a cascade of phosphorylation and activation
  of kinases, which ultimately regulate YAP and TAZ subcellular localization. When
  the pathway is on, the activation of LATS1/2 triggers the inhibitory phosphorylation
  of YAP and TAZ. Phosphorylation on different residues may cause their cytoplasmic
  retention and/or their degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. YAP
  can also be degraded by autophagy. When the pathway is off, YAP/TAZ dephosphorylation
  allows their nuclear import, where they compete with VGLL4 for binding to TEAD transcription
  factors to induce the expression of target genes.
