caption: m6A modification in SARS-CoV-2 RNA and cellular mRNA by METLL3 and RBM15,
  respectively, and its effect on evasion of host innate immune response by SARS-CoV-2
  and host cell. (Left) After entering the host cell, the viral genome enters the
  replication phase, and METTL3 introduces m6A residues in viral RNA. m6A methylated
  SARS-CoV-2 does not bind RIG-I and induces the expression of antiviral molecules
  such as IFNβ. Viral infection also enhances METTL3 and RBM15, leading to enhanced
  host mRNA m6A methylation resulting in activation of inflammatory gene expression
  and programmed cell death. (Right) When antiviral molecules such as IFNβ levels
  increase, it leads to activation JAK-STAT pathway and interferon-stimulated gene
  (ISG) expression. Created with BioRender.
