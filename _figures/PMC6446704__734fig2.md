caption: Regulation of FABP4/aP2 secretion from adipocytes. Circulating FABP4/aP2
  levels are increased during obesity and regulated in response to feeding and fasting.
  In the fed state, insulin suppresses FABP4/aP2 secretion from adipocytes, whereas
  fasting and signals downstream of lipolytic stimuli induce secretion. Activation
  of the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) raises intracellular cAMP levels, which act
  to initiate lipolysis. Induction of FABP4/aP2 secretion requires the actions of
  lipolytic enzymes ATGL and HSL, and to a lesser extent MGL, and the liberation of
  FFAs. Once lipolysis is initiated, FABP4/aP2 may be released in a compartmentalized
  fashion through the lysosomal pathway, and to lesser extent through multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs). How FABP4/aP2 is recruited into these vesicular compartments remains
  to be explored. AC, adenylyl cyclase; CGI-58, comparative gene identification-58;
