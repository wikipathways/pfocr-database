caption: 'Panel A: Role of the pathway JNK (c- Jun kinase N-terminal) in the first
  stage of infection with SARS-CoV2: the protein is not explained response (UPR, in
  the figure); translocates transcription factors such as c- Jun and ATF2 into the
  nucleus and phosphorylates, dimers to form the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and thus
  induces the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bak and FasL; it migrates
  into the mitochondria where it activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, acting
  on the Bcl2 family of proteins.Panel B: Role of the JNK pathway in the advanced
  stages of infection: emerges through the anti-apoptotic. The switching of this path
  towards an attitude conducive to cell survival occurs when the infection has become
  persistent, to use the cell as a source of new viral particles.'
