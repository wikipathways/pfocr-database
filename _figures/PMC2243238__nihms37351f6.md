caption: Growth factor stimulation activates a number of different intercellular signaling
  pathways that intersect to control cell fate outcomes like proliferation and apoptosis.
  For example, activation of Cyclin D/Cdk4 kinase complexes result in phosphorylation
  of Retinoblastoma (Rb) releasing it from E2F1 transcription factor repression. E2F1
  is then free to transcriptionally activate genes that promote proliferation and
  apoptosis. Cells are at least partially able to distinguish ‘normal’ from oncogenic
  stimulated growth through the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway which
  can inhibit the activation of pro-apoptotic target genes and apoptosis by E2F1.
  Cells with PI3K blocked apoptosis are then capable of completing normal proliferation
  without apoptotic interference.
