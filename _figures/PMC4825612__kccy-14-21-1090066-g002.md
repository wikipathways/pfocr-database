caption: Model depicting how p53 and p53/47 control p21CDKN1A and MDM2 expression
  differentially during DNA damage and ER stress context. In the DNA damage pathway,
  p53 full length (p53FL) acts at the transcription level to induce both p21CDKN1A
  and mdm2 mRNAs. The induction of p21CDKN1A leads to G1 cell cycle arrest. During
  DNA damage, MDM2 acts as a positive regulator of p53 activity. The suppression of
  p21CDKN1A and MDM2 during the UPR is attributed to the induction of p53/47, which
  prevents p53FL-mediated induction of p21CDKN1A and mdm2 mRNA levels. This allows
  p53 isomer-dependent suppression of p21CDKN1A and mdm2 mRNA translation to become
  dominant and results in lower p21CDKN1A and MDM2 protein levels. Suppression of
  p21CDKN1A levels is required to arrest in G2 during the UPR but the physiological
  role of MDM2 suppression remains to be elucidated.
