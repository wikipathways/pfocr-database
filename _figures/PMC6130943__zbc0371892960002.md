caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway to ibogaine in T. iboga. Tryptophan and geranyl
  diphosphate undergo multiple transformations (multiple arrows) to yield strictosidine,
  which undergoes multiple transformations (multiple arrows) to yield the hypothesized
  reactive intermediate dehydrosecodine. In iboga, dehydrosecodine is thought to undergo
  cyclization to form the (−)-ibogan scaffold and eventually (−)-coronaridine. Net
  decarboxylation of coronaridine yields ibogamine, which can then undergo 10- hydroxylation
  and 10-O-methylation to yield ibogaine. The pathway could also bifurcate through
  voacangine, whereby net decarboxylation of voacangine could lead to ibogaine. Percentages
  and arrow thickness indicate the relative activity of I10H and N10OMT for different
  substrate in the pathway, underscoring the potential routes to ibogaine. Red arrows
  represent the steps that are the focus of this study.
