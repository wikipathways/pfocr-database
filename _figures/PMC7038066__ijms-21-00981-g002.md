caption: Proposed model of NO-dependent protein–protein interactions underlying GluA1
  and GluA2 subunits’ trafficking. Red text and black dashed line represent cascades
  requiring additional proofs. (1) S-nitrosylation of N-methylmaleimide-sensitive
  factor (NSF) causes declustering of the protein interacting with C kinase 1) (PICK1)-GluA2
  complex, which promotes incorporation in the membrane of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors
  [,]; (2) nitrosylation of stargazin increases its binding to GluA1 and enhances
  the surface expression of the subunit []; (3) NO nitrosylates the p35 protein, leading
  to a decrease in the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) enzyme [].
  This process leads to an increase in the number of GluA1 subunits in the synaptic
  membrane [], probably through the ubiquitination of postsynaptic density protein
  95 (PSD-95) protein []; (4) a potential NO-dependent cascade resulting in the GluA1
  insertion. The link between NOS and the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK) pathway can appear during long-term potentiation (LTP), possibly via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CaMKII) activation [,,,]; (5) an additional prospective cAMP
  response element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated pathway of GluA1 incorporation.
  NO, through a number of possible proteins, promotes phosphorylation of CREB [,,],
  which, in turn, increases the GluA1 membrane expression [].
