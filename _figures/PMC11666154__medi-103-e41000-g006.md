caption: LTBP3 combined with SLC (TGF-β and LAP via disulfide bonds) significantly
  strengthen the bioavailability of TGF-β. The released TGF-β triggers both intracellular
  Smad-dependent and non-Smad-dependent signaling pathways. The pathway in yellow
  indicates Smad-dependent signaling pathway inhibiting the differentiation of osteoblasts,
  endothelial cells and islet cells. The p38/MAPK pathway in green not only exerts
  its effects on osteoblasts, but also promotes the proliferation and differentiation
  of smooth muscle cells. The last pathway in blue is that TGF-β causes hypertrophy
  of kidney cells. LAP = latency-associated protein, LTBP3 = latent transforming growth
  factor-beta-binding protein 3, SLC = small latent complex
