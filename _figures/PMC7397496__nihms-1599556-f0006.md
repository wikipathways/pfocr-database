caption: 'There are four ways that Na,K-ATPase mutations can navigate the biosynthetic
  pathway: (a) unimpaired folding and biosynthesis; (b) irremediable misfolding followed
  by proteasomal degradation (ERAD); (c) successful chaperone-assisted folding, which
  delays biosynthesis; and (d) failed chaperone-assisted folding. The chaperones illustrated
  (BiP/GRP-78, calnexin, and HSP70) are just representative of different chaperone
  classes. The factor that makes the consequences of Na,K-ATPase mutations difficult
  to predict is the competition that must occur between mutant and normal ATP1A3 alleles
  for β subunit. In (a), well-folded mutant and normal α subunits should compete equally
  well for β and achieve a 50:50 ratio in patient neurons. In (b), misfolded α3 incapable
  of binding to β will be degraded by ERAD. In this case only WT α3 subunits will
  succeed in reaching the plasma membrane, leading to a mild phenotype. Mutant α3
  degradation may also increase the pool of β subunit available to nascent chains
  from the normal allele. In (c), association of mutant α3 with β will lead to delayed
  folding () and potentially to a less-than-50:50 ratio of mutant to normal α3 at
  the membrane. This could lessen the effect of gain-of-toxic-function mutations.
  In (d), prolonged retention of β subunit in the ER could effectively sequester β
  subunit and lead to further reduction of Na,K-ATPase expression, protein aggregation,
  and the triggering of autophagy and apoptosis. Any given mutation could lie between
  these four extremes. Superimposed on the outcomes for (a, c, and d) will be any
  functional effects of mutation on the activity or kinetics of the folded and trafficked
  protein. [Color essential]'
