caption: Representative schematic of cobalt roles in activating two signaling pathways
  involved in angiogenesis progress, i.e., the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/MEK/ERK pathway.
  It is assumed that cobalt via Akt activation could trigger transcription factors
  including SP1, NF-κB, RTEF and NFAT and thereby result in enhanced the transcription
  of HIF-1/2. Moreover, cobalt through activation of the MEK/ERK pathway could leads
  to the phosphorylation of 4E-BP and subsequent enhanced HIF-1 α translation.
