caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the synthesis and delivery mechanism of FTS/YM155
  NCs. TmSm was genetically fused to the C‐terminus of FTH1 gene through MMP‐2 sensitive
  peptide and YM155 was encapsulated in the hollow nanocage (NC) of FTS NCs by urea‐mediated
  disassembly/assembly. The developed FTS/YM155 NCs were accumulated in the tumor
  site after intravenous injection. FTS/YM155 NCs could sequentially release TmSm
  protein in tumor microenvironment and YM155 into cancer cells via responding to
  enriched MMP‐2 and binding of TfR1. TmSm was delivered to the cytoplasm through
  TAT peptide and formed a heterodimer with wild‐type survivin, which could be degraded
  by the ubiquitination pathway. YM155 was released to the nucleus to inhibit the
  transcription expression of survivin. Overall, FTS/YM155 NCs could synergistically
  inhibit survivin at the transcription and protein levels. MMP‐2, matrix metalloproteinase‐2;
  TfR1, transferrin receptor 1
