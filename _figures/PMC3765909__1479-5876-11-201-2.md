caption: Mechanism of blockade of the Wnt signalling pathway by osteocytes. Osteocytes
  detect changes in bone morphology through their sensitivity to mechanical forces,
  thereby regulating bone turnover through direct physical contact with osteoblasts.
  Osteocytes produce OPN, DMP, MEPE, SCL and DKK-1. The β-catenin-dependent canonical
  Wnt signalling pathway controls gene expression by stabilizing β-catenin in regulating
  a diverse array of biological processes. It is initiated by binding of appropriate
  Wnt ligands to the frizzled (Fz) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins
  5 and 6 (LRP-5/6) and can be antagonized by secreted proteins from SCL and the DKK
  family, that bind with high affinity to LRP-5 or LRP-6, thereby directly prevent
  Wnt binding. Wnt proteins act on osteoblast precursor cells through this pathway
  and promote their differentiation into mature osteoblasts. In addition, they can
  suppress bone resorption by up-regulating OPG and down-regulating RANKL expression
  in mature osteoblasts, leading to a net increase in bone mass []. Additionally research
  has targeted the complex regulation of osteocyte action by expression of PTH/PTHrP
  receptor’s (PPR’s). Osteocyte activation of PPR leads to down-regulation of Sost
  and increased Wnt signalling stimulating bone formation, accompanied by up-regulation
  of RANKL expression and osteoclast number increasing resorption. In contrast the
  main effect of PPR deletion on osteocytes is reduced osteoclast and osteoblast numbers
  and decreased bone remodelling [].
