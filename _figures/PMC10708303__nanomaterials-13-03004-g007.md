caption: Scheme of PACAP functions, in which exogenous PACAP delivery promotes signaling
  pathways that support cellular survival. Conversely, the deficiency of PACAP leads
  to mitochondrial-mediated oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. This signaling
  cascade involves several key pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, also known as the ERK signaling pathway, the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) signaling pathway (often referred to as the
  AKT signaling pathway), and the phospholipase C (PLC) signaling pathway (created
  with BioRender)
