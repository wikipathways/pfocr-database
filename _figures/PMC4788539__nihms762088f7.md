caption: Schematic model recapitulating the role Shoc2 plays in controlling ERK1/2
  activity. Shoc2 routes signals of the ERK1/2 pathway activated by EGFR for transcription
  of late response genes. Loss of Shoc2-mediated ERK1/2 signals affects crosstalk
  with other signaling pathways and transcription of various substrates, including
  LGALS3BP.
