caption: 'Cellular metabolic pathways activated during feeding and calorie restriction
  and fasting. During feeding, insulin and IGF1 lead to the activation of the insulin-pAKT-mTOR
  pathway, that drives downstream gene activities that promote anabolic processes,
  cell growth and cell survival. This pathway, although crucial for the organism,
  also favor the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells). In contrast,
  CR or a few hours of fasting activate AMPK, which triggers repair and catabolic
  processes, as well as autophagy. CR and fasting have an anti-Warburg effect by counteracting
  the insulin and IGF1 pathways. AKT: Protein Kinase B; AMPK: AMP-activated protein
  Kinase; CR: Calorie Restriction; IGF1: Insulin-like Growth Factor 1; IRS: Insulin
  Receptor Substrates; MAP: Mitogen-Activated Protein; mTOR: mechanistic Target OF
  Rapamycin; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase; PIP2: Phosphatidylinositol biphosphate;
  PIP3: Phosphatidylinositol triphosphate; ULK1: Serine/threonine-protein kinase 1.'
