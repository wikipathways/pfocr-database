caption: Role of purinergic receptors in regulation of insulin secretion in the β
  cell. Glucose enters the cell via the facilitative GLUT-2 transporter. Metabolism
  of glucose leads to production of ATP, which closes the ATP-sensitive channel, KATP,
  comprising four Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits. Closure of KATP depolarises the cell membrane
  and opens voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ action potentials are generated.
  Increase in the cellular Ca2+ is the triggering event that leads to exocytosis of
  secretory vesicles containing insulin. Stimulation of P2 receptors can increase
  triggering and amplification of signals associated with the glucose effect on insulin
  secretion. The P2Y1 receptors increase cellular Ca2+ and activate PKC pathways.
  In addition, the P2Y1 or other P2Y receptors can activate the cyclic AMP pathway.
  Putative P2X receptors allow Ca2+/Na+ influx and membrane depolarisation, and thereby
  they can elicit some insulin secretion even at low glucose concentrations. Adenosine
  interacts with the A1 receptors, which inhibit the cyclic AMP pathways and thereby
  insulin secretion. At high adenosine concentrations, it is postulated that some
  adenosine transported into the β cell exerts metabolic effects
