caption: (a) Overlap between proteins and differentially expressed genes in striatum,
  as measured by mass spectrometry and microarray technologies. The overlap of upregulated
  proteins/genes is shown on the left, the overlap of downregulated proteins/genes
  on the right. (b) Overlap between proteins and differentially expressed genes in
  PD cortex, as measured by proteomics and microarray technologies. The overlap of
  upregulated proteins/genes is shown on the left, the overlap of downregulated proteins/genes
  on the right. (c) Oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The most significantly enriched
  upregulated pathway for PD cortex based on proteomics data. Red thermometers represent
  proteins with increased abundance. (d) Regulation of CDK5 in presynaptic signaling.
  The most significantly enriched downregulated pathway for PD cortex based on proteomics
  data. Blue thermometers represent proteins with decreased abundance.

  description: (a) Overlap between proteins and differentially expressed genes in
    striatum, as measured by mass spectrometry and microarray technologies. The overlap
    of upregulated proteins/genes is shown on the left, the overlap of downregulated
    proteins/genes on the right. (b) Overlap between proteins and differentially expressed
    genes in PD cortex, as measured by proteomics and microarray technologies. The
    overlap of upregulated proteins/genes is shown on the left, the overlap of downregulated
    proteins/genes on the right. (c) Oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The most significantly
    enriched upregulated pathway for PD cortex based on proteomics data. Red thermometers
    represent proteins with increased abundance. (d) Regulation of CDK5 in presynaptic
    signaling. The most significantly enriched downregulated pathway for PD cortex
    based on proteomics data. Blue thermometers represent proteins with decreased
    abundance.
