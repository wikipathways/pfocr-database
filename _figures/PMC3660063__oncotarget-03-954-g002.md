caption: ERK can phosphorylate members of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and even upstream
  EGFR. Sometimes these phosphorylation events mediated by ERK can inhibit the activity
  of the phosphorylated molecule. ERK can also phosphorylate Ets which can lead to
  transcription of the DUSP genes which in turn can inactivate ERK by dephosphorylation.
  PP2A can also suppress Raf activity by dephosphorylation. The activated EGFR is
  depicted in blue. Kinases are indicated by green ovals. Phosphatases are indicated
  by black octagons. Coupling molecules are indicated by orange ovals. Ras is indicated
  by a purple oval. The transcription factors Ets is indicated by a yellow diamond.
  The activated EGFR is depicted in blue. Red arrows indicate activating events in
  pathways. Black arrows indicate inactivating events in pathway. Activating phosphorylation
  events are depicted in red circles with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating
  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events are depicted in black circles with Ps with
  a red outlined circle.
