caption: 'Schematic of AS-amplified JQ1 toxicity in gastric and colon cancer cells
  via the mitochondrial pathway.Notes: In gastric and colon cancer cells, AS and JQ1
  synergistically modulated NFATc protein family and c-Myc, which were responsible
  for cell viability and tumor invasiveness and metastasis. AS and JQ1 exerted synergistic
  cytotoxicity via upregulating Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, leading to cytochrome c release from
  the dysfunctional mitochondrial, the caspase-3 activation, and the subsequent cell
  apoptosis. The decreased tumor invasiveness and metastasis induced by AS and JQ1
  were further confirmed by the decreased protein level of MMP-9, E-cadherin, and
  VEGF. Pointer arrow indicates stimulation; flat arrow indicates inhibition.Abbreviations:
  AS, arsenic sulfide; J, JQ1; MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; NFAT, nuclear
  factor of activated T-cell; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.'
