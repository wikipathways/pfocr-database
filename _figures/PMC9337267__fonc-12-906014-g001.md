caption: 'Metabolic changes, signalling pathway alterations and therapeutic targets
  in FHdRCC. (A) Metabolic changes in FH deficiency: in the glycolytic pathway, glucose
  is converted to pyruvate by glycolysis (GLY), which can enter the mitochondria and
  fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, also known as citrate as well as
  Krebs cycle. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) generates fumarate and fumarate hydratase
  (FH) catalyzes the stereospecific hydration of fumarate to form L-malate. Glutaminase
  (GLS) breaks down glutamine to form glutamate, which is further converted to α-ketoglutarate
  and feeds the TCA cycle. In the urea cycle, argininosuccinate is cleaved by argininosuccinase
  (ASL), producing additional fumarate. This step can be reversed by the argininosuccinase
  synthase (ASS) if argininosuccinate is required (). In FH deficiency, fumarate accumulating
  in the mitochondria can leak out to the cytosol and become an ‘oncometabolite’.
  (B) Fumarate-induced activation of signalling pathways: cytosolic fumarate, like
  succinate, inhibits a family of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), which under normoxia
  destabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) through hydroxylation of prolyl residues.
  Fumarate (and succinate)-induced PHD inhibition causes HIF-1α accumulation. In the
  nucleus, HIF-1α activates the transcription of target genes including vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and glycolytic genes, initiating the metabolic shift known
  as the Warburg effect (left panel). Fumarate and succinate accumulation can also
  act as α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) antagonist, inhibiting α-KG-dependent dioxygenases.
  Thus, histone de-methylation process catalyzed by histone demethylases (KDM) is
  inhibited. Consecutively, epigenetic alterations including hypermethylation at histone
  markers H3K9 and HRK27 inhibit tumor suppressor genes resulting in tumor progression,
  drug resistance and cell dedifferentiation (31, mid panel). In a non-enzymatic process,
  high concentrations of fumarate can also lead to the succination of cysteine residues
  of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which thus loses its ability to
  prevent nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2)-mediated antioxidant
  responses (right panel). In FHdRCC, NRF2 activation is protumorigenic. (C) Targeting
  strategies for FHdRCC: fumarate-induced HIF activation promotes tumor angiogenesis
  and proliferation through VEGF signalling, suggesting the use of bevacizumab to
  neutralize VEGF. Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a frequent
  event in many tumors, can also activate HIF-1α, and HIF-1α induced VEGF can contribute
  to the resistance against EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib. This has led to bevacizumab
  plus erlotinib combination therapy in certain cancer types including FHdRCC. The
  metabolic shift arising from FH deficiency results in decreased levels of adenosine
  monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and, as a consequence, of the
  tumor suppressor p53. Raising the activity of AMPK again may therefore also be desirable
  in FHdRCC, which can be achieved using metformin, an indirect AMPK activator ().
  In addition, targeting the metabolic escape routes of FH-deficient cells through
  inhibitors of heme biosynthesis and degradation would be attractive in the treatment
  of FHdRCC (). Given the strict arginine dependence of FH-deficient tumor cells arginine
  deprivation () and de-methylating agents () according to DNA CGI hypermethylation
  phenotype might be a therapy-supporting concept.'
