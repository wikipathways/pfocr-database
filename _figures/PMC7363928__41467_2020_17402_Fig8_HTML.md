caption: Our model suggests that enhanced lactate-produced by BM neutrophils during
  bacterial infection induces neutrophil mobilization by modulating metabolic signaling
  in BM endothelial cells. LPS binds TLR4 expressed on neutrophils that directly activates
  NADPH oxidase (NOX) and enhances glucose uptake via a glucose transporter 1a. Glucose
  in turn, is converted to pyruvate by the glycolysis pathway 1b. NOX activity leads
  to ROS production (2) which elevates HIF-1α expression. HIF-1α in turn, induces
  downstream expression of LDHA that converts pyruvate to lactate 3a. HIF-1α also
  up-regulates the lactate transporter MCT4 3b to allow lactate release (4). Under
  steady-state conditions, surface VE–cadherin on endothelial cells (ECs) is highly
  expressed, which maintains the endothelial barrier integrity with low permeability
  (a). During inflammation (b), lactate released from BM neutrophils binds to GPR81
  on sinusoidal BM endothelial cells 5a, activates Gi protein and thereby reduces
  cAMP/Epac1 activity 5b. Consequently, lactate via GPR81 signaling decreases surface
  VE–cadherin expression (5c), leading to higher BM vascular permeability (6). In
  addition, lactate elevates CXCL1 and G-CSF levels (produced by different cells including
  ECs,) also in a GPR81-independent manner 7a with more moderate increases in CXCL2
  levels in WT mice (most probably produced by BM neutrophils). Lactate-induced elevation
  of CXCL1, CXCL2, and G-CSF downregulates surface CXCR2 expression on PB neutrophils
  7b facilitating neutrophil mobilization (8). Taken together, LPS-induced lactate
  promotes rapid neutrophil mobilization from the BM to the blood (8) preferentially
  via BM GPR81/VE–cadherin-dependent (5–6) and also by GPR81-independent (7) pathways.
