caption: (a). Tracing by 2,3-13C2-alanine pinpoints the substrate origin for TCA cycle
  intermediates and deoxysphingolipids in colon cancer cells. Labeling by 2,3-13C2-alanine
  suggests that colon cancer cells enhance alanine incorporation into the TCA cycle.
  Concomitantly, reduced availability of 2,3-13C2-alanine results in decreased synthesis
  of 13C-labeled deoxysphingolipids, which exhibit cytotoxic effects in cancer cells.
  [] (b). The use of 1,2-13C2-glucose provides quantitative assessment of relative
  pathway activities along glycolysis and the PPP. This labeling work indicates highly
  active PPP in primary oligodendrocytes. [] (c). Metabolic flux analysis suggests
  activated reductive carboxylation of glutamine into de novo lipogenesis in hypoxic
  cancer cells [,].
