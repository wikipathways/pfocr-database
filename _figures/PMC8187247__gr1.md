caption: 'Model of the herpesvirus life cycle. All members of the Herpesviridae share
  a common structure, a mature virion composed of these four parts: genomic DNA, capsid,
  tegument, and envelope with glycoproteins. The innermost layer is viral DNA which
  located in an icosahedral protein cage called the capsid surrounded by a tegument
  proteins layer. The outermost layer is the envelope containing multiple glycoproteins.
  Infection is initiated when viral envelope glycoproteins bind to the specific types
  of cell surface receptors include HVEM, nectin-1/2, PDGFα, CD21 and 3-O-S HS etc.
  Post-binding events: viral particles enter into cells mainly through direct fusion
  with cell membrane or via an endocytic pathway. Next, viral capsid is dismantled
  and viral DNA enters host cell nucleus through nuclear pore. Within the nucleus,
  viral IE and E genes will be transcribed mediating the replication of viral genomic
  DNA. After 24h infection, transcript of the late (L) gene occurs and the produce
  capsid proteins so that a new nucleocapsid will assemble in host cell nucleus and
  guiding viral DNA to enter the capsid. After these immature particles pass through
  the nuclear membrane, they acquire an envelope. A secondary envelopment occurs in
  host cytoplasm to help virus forming mature virions, finally the virions leave the
  host cell via exocytosis.'
