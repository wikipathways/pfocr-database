caption: 'For each gene, the top row of squares represents the Control and the bottom
  row represents the NAA and 6-BA treatment. The number of squares indicates the number
  of differentially expressed genes with fold changes ≥ 2 or fold change ≤ 0.5 at
  adjusted P < 0.05. Different colors indicate genes that were down-regulated (green)
  or up-regulated (red) in the T group compared with the Control group. Abbreviations
  are as follows: AACT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase; MK, mevalonate kinase; DXR,
  1-deoxy-D-xylulose5-phosphate reductoisomerase; CMK, 4-(cytidine-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D-erythritol
  kinase; MCS, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4- cyclodiphosphate synthase; GPPS, geranyl
  diphosphate synthase; GGPPS, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; DDS, dammarenediol
  synthase; LS, lanosterol synthase; LUS, lupeol synthesis; and UGT, UDP-glycosyltransferase.'
