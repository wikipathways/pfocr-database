caption: Signaling cascades of Cripto-1, Notch/CSL, and Wnt/β-catenin. The transduction
  of Cripto-1 signaling (shown in blue) occurs through both the canonical signaling
  pathway mediated by Smad2/3 with Smad4 following Nodal/GDF-1, -3 activation of the
  Activin type I receptor (Alk4,7)/Activin type II (ActRII) receptor complex and the
  non-canonical pathway resulting in MAPK activation by GRP78 or Glypicans through
  Src. Therapeutic interventions (shown in red) for this pathway include antisense
  oligos to inhibit Cripto-1 expression, small molecule antagonists, and monoclonal
  antibodies (mAbs) against the EGF domain of Cripto-1 to inhibit the non-canonical
  pathway, Alantolactone, small molecule antagonists, mAbs against the CFC domain
  of Cripto-1 and the Cripto-1 ligand Nodal to inhibit the canonical Smad-mediated
  signaling, and a cytotoxin-conjugated non-neutralizing mAb against the amino terminus
  of Cripto-1 to directly kill target cells. Notch/CSL activation (shown in yellow)
  occurs when a Jagged (Jag) or Delta-like (Dll) ligand bound to an adjacent cell
  binds a Notch receptor on the target cell facilitating cleavage by ADAM proteases
  extracellularly followed by the gamma secretase complex intracellularly, releasing
  the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) which translocates to the nucleus to transactivate
  transcription through CSL. Therapeutic strategies against Notch include Notch antisense
  oligonucleotides, mAbs against Notch ligands, mAbs against Notch receptors, and
  gamma secretase inhibitors. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (in green) involves
  the binding of a Wnt ligand to a Frizzled receptor (Fzd) with the aid of a Lrp co-receptor.
  Stimulation of Fzd results in the activation of Disheveled (Dvl) which in turn inhibits
  the β-catenin destruction complex, glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK-3β)/axin/casein
  kinase 1 a (Ck1a)/adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), allowing β-catenin to translocate
  to the nucleus to initiate Tcf/Lef transactivation in the context of Pygo, BCL9,
  and CBP. The non-canonical Wnt pathway (in green) involves the activation of Fzd
  and Dvl leading to the subsequent activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
  and phospholipase C (PLC) triggering gene activation independently of β-catenin.
  The Wnt family can also activate the ROR family of receptor tyrosine kinases to
  potentiate JNK activation. Therapeutic strategies have involved mAbs against various
  members of the Frizzled family, a Frizzled 8-Fc-conjugated decoy receptor, a radiolabeled
  anti-Frizzled-10 mAb, and small molecule antagonists against Porcupine and β-catenin/CBP
  binding
