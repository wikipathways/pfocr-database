caption: H. pylori virulence factors have impact on host cell signaling pathways.
  H. pylori secrete urease, which increases pH in the microenvironment and supports
  bacterial survival. A set of adhesins allow the bacteria to attach to the host cell
  surface and to build a T4SS. CagA and, putatively, ADP-heptose are translocated
  through the T4SS to the cytoplasm and activate SHP2 or ALPK1/TIFA, respectively.
  ADP-heptose triggers activation of the classical NF-κB pathway. MAP kinases JNK
  and p38 and the non-classical NF-κB signaling pathway are regulated in a T4SS-dependent
  but CagA-independent manner (dashed arrows). Bacterial factors responsible for activation
  of the Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways are not known, although an involvement
  of some adhesins has been discussed. The T4SS and CagA seem to be dispensable for
  these pathways. H. pylori secrets VacA, which internalizes into host cells, undergoes
  processing and assembles in stable hexamers that form an ion channel in intracellular
  membranes. It induces formation of giant vacuoles and, finally, cell death. A serine
  protease HtrA secreted by H. pylori cleaves E-cadherin and thereby is involved in
  disruption of adherens junctions and epithelial integrity during infection
