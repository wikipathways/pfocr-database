caption: Schematic of acetylcholine and chlorpyrifos biochemistry. (A) Schematic of
  the mechanism of CPF toxicology at the cholinergic synapse showing normal signaling
  where acetylcholine is recognized by the acetylcholine receptor on the dendrite’s
  postsynaptic membrane before being rapidly broken down by acetylcholinesterase into
  acetic acid and choline. Normally, the free choline is taken back up into the presynaptic
  neuron where choline acetyltransferase turns it back into acetylcholine before it
  is packaged into vesicles for subsequent release. The red “X” indicates CPO-induced
  inhibition of acetylcholinesterase that leads to a buildup of acetylcholine in the
  synaptic cleft and, eventually, excitotoxicity, neuropathy, and death. (B) The major
  metabolic pathway for CPF bioactivation, dearylation, and biodegradation showing
  associated primary metabolites including CPF; chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO); diethylthiophosphate
  (DETP); and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP).
