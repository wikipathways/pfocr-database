caption: 'Schematic overview of trained immunity experimental design in vitro, in
  vivo, and the complex metabolic pathways involved in trained immunity. A. In vitro
  induction of trained immunity: Traditional and novel immune cells are trained by
  β-glucan, oxLDL, LPS, and BCG for 24 hours. Cells are washed twice with PBS and
  rested in culture media for 24 hours, 3 days, or 6 days, after which the cells are
  restimulated with LPS or Pam3Cys for 24 hours. Then cytokine productions are measured.
  B. In vivo induction of trained immunity by a Western diet priming and LPS restimulation.
  Low-density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDLR−/−) mice are fed with Western diet
  for 4 weeks, then, normal chow diet for another 4 weeks. Six hours before sacrifice,
  mice are injected intravenously with LPS or PBS. C. Overview Figure Showing the
  Metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in trained immunity. Trained immunity inducers
  bind to their receptors in the cell membrane or intracellular receptors, leading
  to enhanced signaling of the Akt–mTOR–HIF-1α pathway, modifications in metabolic
  pathways (increased glycolysis, increased acetyl-CoA generation, increased mevalonate
  synthesis), and epigenetic reprogramming. This results in increased pro-inflammatory
  cytokine production and enhanced innate immune response (trained immunity). Abbreviation:
