caption: Pathway diagram of the CTLA4 signaling in cytotoxic T lymphocytes from the
  IPA. Genes that have a positive fold change (up-regulated) are indicated in red,
  and those with a negative fold change (down-regulated) in green. Genes in gray were
  present in the analysis, but did not meet the 1.5-fold change cutoff used in this
  analysis. The intensity of the color is indicative of the degree of regulation.
  Genes in white did not have expression data available. For interpretability, both
  up- and down-regulated genes at baseline are shown in the same diagram, although
  the pathway was significant for only up-regulated at baseline and 36 months and
  not for either time point for the down-regulation. TCR and AP2 (indicated in bold)
  met the 1.5-fold change threshold at baseline, but not at 3 years, all other values
  remained the same
