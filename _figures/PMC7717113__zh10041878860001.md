caption: Estrogen receptor signaling pathways. Estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) signaling
  occurs through genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. During the genomic signaling pathway,
  ESR1 is activated by 17β-estradiol (17β-E2), which represents the strongest natural
  ligand. 17β-E2 binds to ESR1 in the cytoplasm; here, ER-α dimerizes and translocates
  to the nucleus, where it modulates the transcription of target genes by interacting
  with the estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) on the DNA. ESR1 can also be activated
  by growth factors. Growth factors activate their tyrosine kinase receptors, which
  stimulate a tyrosine kinase cascade leading to the phosphorylation and activation
  of ESR1. Phosphorylated ESR1 (P) translocates to the nucleus, where it modulates
  gene transcription. Through the genomic signaling pathway, ESR1 mediates most of
  estrogen’s reproductive effects and some of the estrogen-related metabolic actions.
  During the nongenomic signaling pathway, ESR1 located at the cell membrane initiates
  a rapid cytosolic signaling cascade. ESR1 at the plasma membrane generally localizes
  in the lipid rafts, where it interacts with the proteins caveolin-1 (Cav) and voltage-dependent
  anion channel (VDAC), where it activates rapid cytosolic signaling events. Through
  the nongenomic signaling pathway, ESR1 has been shown to regulate adiposity and
  control body weight as well as to exert neuroprotective functions. eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; CREB, cAMP-responsive
  element binding. TF, transcription factor.
