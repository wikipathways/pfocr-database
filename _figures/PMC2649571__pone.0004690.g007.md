caption: Because lin-17 mutants have both underextension and overextension defects,
  we propose that LIN-17/Fz can activate both a canonical pathway that attracts axons
  (or prevents axon termination) (left) and a yet uncharacterized pathway that repels
  axons (or triggers axon termination) (right). The existence of this additional pathway
  and its interaction with the canonical pathway are supported by the analysis of
  lin-17; bar-1 double mutants (see ). According to this model and consistent with
  our data, both the activation of the uncharacterized pathway and the inhibition
  of the canonical pathway by LIN-44/Wnt are required for the axons to stop in their
  correct position.
