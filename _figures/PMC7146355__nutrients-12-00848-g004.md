caption: 'Synthesis and degradation of histamine: Histamine is formed by the decarboxylation
  of HIS by L-histidine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.22) found in many tissues. Released
  histamine is degraded to 1,4-methyl imidazoleacetic acid; the second pathway of
  histamine degradation is oxidation to imidazoleacetic acid. The metabolites are
  released in the urine or processed to other metabolites. 1, histidine decarboxylase;
  2, histamine-N-methyltransferase; 3, monoamino oxidase; 4, aldehyde dehydrogenase;
  5, diamino oxidase.'
