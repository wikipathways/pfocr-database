caption: 'Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are present on the cell surface
  and recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are present in
  bacteria, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopeptides, and flagellin. Intracellular
  TLRs, including TLRs 3, 7/8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (TLR12/13 are not present in humans),
  recognize PAMPs such as single- or double-stranded RNA (ss/dsRNA) produced by viruses,
  unmethylated CpG motifs produced by bacteria, and damage-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) such as microRNAs that can be released by host cells following tissue injury.
  Activation of TLRs leads to activation of the signaling adaptor MyD88, that activates
  IKK/NF-κB-dependent transcriptional changes leading to the upregulation of cytokines
  and inflammatory mediators (IFMs). In addition to TLRs, surface PRRs such as C-type
  lectin receptors (CLRs), N-formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), the receptor for advanced
  glycation end products (RAGE), as well as additional intracellular PRRs such as
  the cytosolic dsRNA sensor RIG-I and the dsDNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway, serve
  to detect PAMPs and DAMPs, leading to transcriptional induction of IFMs, cytokines,
  and chemokines. Finally, several PRRs such as RIG-I and AIM-2, as well as exogenous
  stimuli (e.g., ROS, low pH, ATP), lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  and this drives the maturation and release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β
  and IL-18. Extracellular IL-1α can also be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases (MMP-9
  and MMP-2) under neuropathic pain []. The net result of this process is to initiate
  immunity, induce local inflammation, and amplify the immune response. Abbreviations:
  cGAMP, cyclic GAMP-AMP; cGAS, cGAMP synthase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; mtDNA,
  mitochondrial DNA.'
