caption: 'Global metabolic shift in Mtb CCM is required for forming persisters. (A)
  Mtb CCM activities are required for its replication. Enzymatic steps dedicated to
  glycolysis are depicted in green, the TCA cycle in brown, the MCC in purple, and
  the nitrogen metabolism in teal. (B) Mtb shifts CCM carbon fluxes to form persisters.
  Rerouted pathways are indicated by red arrows. The trehalose-mediated catalytic
  shift leads to catabolic remodeling of TDM/TMM, which increases the carbon flux
  towards the biosynthesis of upper glycolytic intermediates and the PPP, while downregulating
  the flux to the lower glycolysis. Carbon flow through the glyoxylate shunt and MCC
  is upregulated to increase the biosynthesis of succinate. Toxic accumulation of
  MCC intermediates is accompanied by increasing glutamate synthase activity (GltB/D),
  an activity known to neutralize MCC-mediated metabolic intoxication. Abbreviations
  are as follows: TMM, trehalose monomycoate; TDM, trehalose dimycolate; FBP, fructose
  1,6 bisphosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate, 2M(I)C, 2-methyl (iso)citrate; OAA,
  oxaloacetate; αKG, alpha-ketoglutarate; Succ, Succinate; Pro-CoA, propionyl-CoA;
  GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GS, glyoxylate shunt; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
