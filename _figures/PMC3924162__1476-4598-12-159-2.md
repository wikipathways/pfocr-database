caption: Signaling pathways in PCSCs. The HH and Notch developmental pathways are
  highly active in PCSCs and may be activated by a series of respective ligands. The
  SHH/Gli signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in maintenance of stemness (self-renewal)
  via regulation of the expression of the pluripotency-maintaining factors Nanog,
  Oct4, c-Myc, and Sox2. Upon activation by interaction with ligands, Notch is cleaved
  and translocated to the nucleus for transcriptional activation of Notch target genes,
  including hairy and enhancer of split-1, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), cyclin D1, and
  c-Myc. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is vitally involved in cell fate determination
  via binding to the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer factor
  (TCF/LEF). PI3K/AKT signaling is involved in PCSCs by directly interacting with
  CD133. FOXM1 plays a pivotal role in PCSCs by directly stimulating stem-like characteristics
  and cross-talk with other pathways. Abnormal signaling pathways also may involve
  PCSCs but are not illustrated in this figure. IGF, insulin-like growth factor; EGF,
