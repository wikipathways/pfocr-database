caption: The antitumor immunity effect of the cGAS-STING pathway. DNA damage leads
  to the formation of dsDNA in tumor cells, upon its stimulation, STING signaling
  is activated and promotes the release of Type I IFN, which is crucial for DC maturation.
  STING signaling activation in DCs is the core step of the whole cancer-immunity
  cycle, which can be initiated through engulfment of dying/damaged tumor cells, exosome
  transfer and cGAMP gap junctions. Then DCs migrate towards the tumor-draining lymph
  node and cross-prime tumor specific CD8+ T cells with the help of Type I IFNs. Finally,
  T cells undergo clonal expansion and traffic through the blood vessel to conduct
  tumor killing
