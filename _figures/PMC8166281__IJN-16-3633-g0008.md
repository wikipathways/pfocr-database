caption: Schematic illustration of proposed cellular and molecular mechanism of vascular
  calcification induced by nano-HAp crystals. After HAp crystals are internalized
  into VSMC, more ROS will be generated, which will activate JNK phosphorylation.
  ① Activation of JNK/c-JUN signaling cascade will induce RunX2, OPN, and ALP gene
  expression and osteogenic differentiation of VSMC. ② JNK pathway promotes the release
  of cytochrome c, which will activate the caspase cascade, finally inducing apoptosis.
  Both osteogenic differentiation and apoptosis of VSMC will result in VC. JNK inhibitor
  effectively reduced these effects of HAp on VSMCs, and inhibited HAp-induced VC
  in vivo.
