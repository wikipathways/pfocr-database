caption: 'Bioenergetics and biochemistry of a synthetic pathway for ethanol production
  in P. furiosus. Glucose is oxidized by a variation of the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas
  pathway: The glycerinaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is not coupled to ATP production
  and NAD reduction, but the energy is used to reduce the low potential electron acceptor
  ferredoxin. Pyruvate is oxidized by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and acetyl
  CoA is reduced to acetate by the unusual acetyl-CoA synthetase, leading to the formation
  of ATP. Ferredoxin is indicated to transfer one electron. Four electrons are fed
  into the Mbh to produce molecular hydrogen and to generate a transmembrane electrochemical
  sodium ion potential that then drives ATP synthesis by a sodium ion translocating
  A1AO ATP synthase. Stoichiometries for the membrane-bound reactions are not known.
  The other 4 mol of reduced ferredoxin are used to reduce the 2 mol of acetate to
  acetalydehyde, and four more electrons derived from molecular hydrogen via NAD(P)H
  are used to reduce the 2 mol of acetalydehyde to ethanol. The electrons may also
  originate from oxidation of carbon monoxide by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH)
  coupled to reduction of ferredoxin and its reoxidation by the ion-translocating
  Mbh. Cells apparently also take up different carboxylic acids and convert them by
  the AOR/AdhA pathway to the corresponding alcohol.'
