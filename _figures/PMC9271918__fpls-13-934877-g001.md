caption: Salt stress signal transduction in plants. The SOS pathway, consisting of
  SOS3, SCaBP8, SOS2, and SOS1, is essential for decoding salt-induced calcium signals
  and maintaining ionic homeostasis in the plant cell. 14-3-3, GIGANTEA (GI), ABI2,
  and BIN2 proteins negatively regulate SOS pathway activity by directly interacting
  with SOS2 and repressing its kinase activity. PKS5-mediated phosphorylation of SOS2
  enhances its interaction with 14-3-3, thereby inhibiting and maintaining basal levels
  of SOS2 activity under normal conditions. Arabidopsis K+ TRANSPORTER 1 (AKT1) activity
  is repressed by SCaBP8. GIPCs might function as monovalent-cation sensors that bind
  to Na+ and initiate calcium influx, which further activates the SOS pathway. AtANN4,
  a putative calcium-permeable transporter, might also generate calcium influx to
  activate the SOS pathway under salt stress. OSCA1 functions as an osmosensor to
  generate osmotic Ca2+signaling in response to osmotic stress. Feedback regulation
  of AtANN4 by the SOS pathway is required to fine-tune the formation and duration
  of salt-induced calcium influx and long-term salt stress responses. Phosphatidylinositol
  (PI) directly binds to the C-terminus of the plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase AHA2
  to repress its activity. PI is converted into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)
  to release the inhibition of AHA2 under salt stress. PI4P binds to and activates
  the PM Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1. PIP3 and RLK7 accumulate under salt stress, and the
  PIP3-RLK7 interaction contributes to the activation of RLK7, resulting in the activation
  of MPK3/6 to transduce stress signals. MAP kinase cascades are involved in regulating
  salt stress signal transduction. RAFs are required for the phosphorylation and activation
  of SnRK2s in response to salt-induced osmotic stress, and SnRK2 activity is amplified
  by auto-phosphorylation. In the nucleus, several specific transcription factors
  that are downstream targets of MPKs and SnRK2s bind to and activate the expression
  of salt stress-responsive genes. In the vacuole, NHXs, CAX1, the vacuolar Ca2+/H+
  antiporter and vacuolar H+-ATPase (VHA) exclude Na+ from the cell. The dashed lines
  indicate regulatory roles under normal conditions.

  description: Salt stress signal transduction in plants. The SOS pathway, consisting
