caption: Under homeostatic conditions regarding canonical pathway of Nrf2, Nrf2 is
  degraded via formation of the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex and ubiquitination. Due
  to the stress-associated oxidative modification of Keap1, Nrf2 dissociates from
  the Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex and translocates to the nucleus. In the non-canonical
  pathway under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 binds to β-TrCP via its phosphorylation
  mediated by GSK3. Following this, Nrf2 is ubiquitinated and degraded due to interaction
  between β-TrCP and Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Cannabidiol (CBD) can
  modulate the redox status of cells by interfering with canonical and non-canonical
  pathways of Nrf2 and altering the level of proteins and miRNAs participating in
  Nrf2 activity. (The black and blue dashed arrows are used for canonical and non-canonical
  pathways, respectively; the dark green or soft-green arrows are used for CBD-mediated
  increase or decrease in the level of proteins and miRNAs, respectively; the black

  description: Under homeostatic conditions regarding canonical pathway of Nrf2, Nrf2
    is degraded via formation of the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex and ubiquitination.
    Due to the stress-associated oxidative modification of Keap1, Nrf2 dissociates
    from the Keap1-Cul3-RBX1 complex and translocates to the nucleus. In the non-canonical
    pathway under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 binds to β-TrCP via its phosphorylation
    mediated by GSK3. Following this, Nrf2 is ubiquitinated and degraded due to interaction
    between β-TrCP and Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1 ubiquitin ligase complex. Cannabidiol (CBD)
    can modulate the redox status of cells by interfering with canonical and non-canonical
    pathways of Nrf2 and altering the level of proteins and miRNAs participating in
    Nrf2 activity. (The black and blue dashed arrows are used for canonical and non-canonical
