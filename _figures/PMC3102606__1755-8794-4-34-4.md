caption: 'Pathway context for RME modules found in glioblastoma. Genes colored red
  are recurrently mutated in such a way that we expect loss of function, and those
  colored green are amplified or contain putatively activating mutations. The d-score
  is the algorithmic significance value, with significance being equal to 2-d. 1st
  row: Alterations in MDM2, TP53, and EP300 each result in less tumor suppression
  from TP53. EGFR and ERBB2 are both activators of the RTK/RAS/PI3K oncogenic signaling
  pathways. 2nd row: four new modules of size two that do not directly correspond
  to a known pathway.'
