caption: 'The activation of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway by Pseudomonas sp.
  strain ADAl3–4. (A) The differential expression of key genes in the flavonoid biosynthesis
  pathway in the Al+ADAl3–4 vs. Al–CK group. The gene names in red, upregulated genes;
  in green, downregulated genes; in blue, both up- and downregulated genes in the
  same family. The blue and red blocks in front of the gene numbers represent gene
  expression levels according to the color scale. The gray dotted lines and rectangles
  indicate downstream pathways. The same apply in Figure 6A,B. (B) RT–qPCR validation
  of selected genes under aluminum stress following ADAl3–4 inoculation. All data
  are the mean ± SE of three biological replicates, with three technical replicates
  per biological replicate. ACTIN was used as endogenous reference. (C) The quantification
  of total flavonoid content in alfalfa roots under different treatments. All data
  are mean ± SE of three biological replicates. Statistical significance was assessed
  using Student’s t-test. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001. Abbreviations:
  CHS, chalcone synthase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; F3H, flavanone 3–hydroxylase;
  F3’H, flavonoid 3′–hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase'
