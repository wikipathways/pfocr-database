caption: '. CL biosynthetic and remodeling pathways. The indicated reactions of CL
  biosynthetic pathway are catalyzed by the following enzymes: CTP-phosphatidic acid
  cytidylytransferase (CPC), phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase (PGS), phosphatidylglycerolphosphate
  phosphatase (PP), and CL synthase (CLS). In addition to CL synthesis, CLS is also
  involved in phosphatidylglycerol remodeling by catalyzing acylation of lysophosphatidylglycerol
  (LPG) to phosphatidylglycerol. Phosphatidylglycerol remodeling can also by catalyzed
  by LPG acyltransferase (LPGAT1). The CL remodeling pathway is catalyzed by phospholipase
  (cPLA) and acyl-CoA:lysoCL acyltransferase (ALCAT).'
