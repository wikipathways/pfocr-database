caption: The HPV18 pathway regulates Tim-3/galectin-9 through EZH2-H2K27me3-DNMT3A.
  HPV18 E6 and E7 regulates EZH2 through direct binding of FOXM1 and E2F-1 the EZH2
  promoter in order to activate EZH2 expression; in turn, H3K27me3 is upregulated.
  EZH2 and H3K27me3 directly interact with the DNMT3A promoter to downregulate its
  expression. When DNMT3A is decreased, the HAVCR2/LGALS9 promoter region is also
  demethylated and Tim-3/galectin-9 expression is upregulated.
