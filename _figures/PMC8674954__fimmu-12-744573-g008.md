caption: Proposal of an instructive differentiation model of LZ BGC-cells integrating
  the expression of the CD23 marker. BGC-cells are predominantly CD23- compete for
  antigen (Ag) when only limited amount of Ag is available (top-left B cells). Fit
  cells proliferate, retrieve Ag deposited on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and
  receive survival signals from stromal cells (top-middle part). Note that FDCs express
  IL-4R and may take available IL-4 cytokine - in a non-directed manner [IL-4 broadcasting
  as called in ()] – produced by Tfh. Both, high and low-affinity cells process Ag
  and present - in proportion to its affinity - peptide-MHC complex which supports
  the interaction with cognate Tfh and the delivery of crucial molecules including
  IL-21, CD40L and IL-4 leading to pSTAT6 expression (right-middle part). The split
  of the B cell fate depends on the integration of sufficient signals which impacts
  the maintenance or extinction of the IL-4/pSTAT6 signaling pathway. B cells that
  have quenched the IL-4/STAT6 signal are unable to express the CD23 marker and progress
  further to the PB axis of differentiation (bottom-right). These CD23- LZ BGC-cells
  correspond to pre-PB described previously () which express transiently MYC leading
  to cell cycle and the committal step of differentiation described elsewhere ().
  In contrast, CD23+ LZ BGC-cells which have maintained IL-4/STAT6 signaling are prone
  to apoptosis or give rise to pre-MBCs; the maintenance of CD23 expression depends
  on the presence of IL-4 and CD40 stimuli (bottom-middle). In the right square, a
  view of the  concerning scRNA-seq data for BGC-cells representing the fate of activated
  LZ BGC-cells between pre-MBC or PB outputs.
