caption: Simplified schematics illustrating some of the metabolic inputs into the
  Hippo-YAP signaling network. Glucose has effects through glycolysis, HBP and insulin
  signaling. (a) Glycolysis promotes a PFK1-TEAD1-YAP complex including the glycolytic
  enzyme PFK1, promoting YAP activity. Glucose is also required for UDP-GlcNAc generation
  through the HBP pathway, which is used for OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation of YAP and
  AMOT, increasing their stability and nuclear localization, respectively. Glucose
  also stimulates insulin release from the pancreas, activating a cascade including
  PI3K, PDK1 and AKT. AKT can phosphorylate MST1/2 inhibiting its activity. (b) Glucose-dependent
  activation of YAP through AMPK suppression. Glucose through glycolysis and mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) inactivates AMPK by decreasing AMP/ATP ratio.
  The glycolysis intermediate fructose-1,6-biphosphate and the glycolytic enzyme Aldolase
  also inhibit AMPK. In low glucose or high AMP/ATP environments, AMPK is activated,
  which can inhibit YAP by directly phosphorylating it, and by phosphorylating AMOT,
  which can stimulate LATS1/2. (c) Hippo-YAP signaling is regulated by the mTOR pathway,
  providing another input from the Insulin pathway, and also input from amino acids
  and other nutrients that regulate mTOR signaling. mTORC2 can inhibit MST1 by phosphorylating
  it. mTOR also suppresses autophagy, which can regulate YAP. (d) Fatty acids increase
  the expression of JCAD, which inhibits LATS2. Palmitic acid increases levels of
  MST1, through the activation of IRF3. (e) GPCR receptors have dual roles in Hippo-YAP
  regulation. Some types, associated with Gα12/13 or Gαq/11, promote activation of
  YAP proteins through RhoA activation, whereas others associated with Gαs suppress
  YAP activity through activation of LATS1/2 via cAMP/PKA. The mevalonate pathway
  can also stimulate RhoA activation by promoting its recruitment to cell membranes.
  Cholesterol stimulates RhoA through a pathway involving PKA mediated calcium release.
  RhoA increases YAP activity through effects on the F-actin cytoskeleton.
