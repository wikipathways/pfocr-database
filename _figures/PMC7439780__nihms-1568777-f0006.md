caption: Protein-protein interaction (PPI) regulatory network of proteins involved
  in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Differentially expressed proteins of the
  PPP were combined for building a regulatory network using String software. (A) The
  evidence-based interaction network analysis, (B) The confidence-based interaction
  network analysis, (C) The molecular action-based interaction network analysis, (D)
  A k means cluster analysis of the genes. (E) A Markov Cluster Algorithm (MCL) cluster
  analysis of the genes.
