caption: The lined arrows from the carbohydrates in dashed-line boxes or the double
  lined arrows from the intermediates indicate carbon flows in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis,
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), entner–doudoroff (ED) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle pathways, respectively. The grey box displays fbaB encodes a fructose-bisphophate
  aldolase that converts vertically fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The mutation in fbaB has no influence
  on ED and PPP pathways, but impairs glycolysis of the pathogen to use fructose and
  block gluconeogenesis to use pyruvate and malate. The expression of an unknown regulator
  in a cycled question mark may be enhanced by galactose, glucose, mannose, sucrose,
  fructose and pyruvate (as shown by dash-lined arrow) and repressed by malate (a
  dash-lined arrow with a stop bar). The unkown factor may differentially regulate
  the expression of hrpG or/and hrpX which down-regulate the expression of fbaB (a
  dash-lined arrow with a stop bar). The unknown regulator may also control the transcripts
  of hrcC, hrpE and hpa3 (other than other hrp-hrc-hpa genes) which are not completely
  regulated by HrpG and HrpX . Being the components of the T3SS apparatus, HrcC, HrpE
  and Hpa3 may faciliate X. oryzae pv. oryzicola to utilize the intermediates, like
  pyruvate and malate, of the TCA cycle from plants.
