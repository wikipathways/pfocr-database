caption: Upstream regulators and their target molecules in datasets as identified
  by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). A – The list of differentially regulated on
  microarray (n = 418) and Ensembl reannotated genes was used as an input for analysis;
  B – Subset of these genes (n = 28; List eQG from []) was used as an input. Molecules
  in red denote up-regulation, molecules in green denote down-regulation and molecules
  in orange denote predicted activation in response to 6 hours infection with live
  Staphylococcus aureus in bovine macrophages. Lines in orange denote predicted activation;
  lines in blue - predicted inhibition; lines in yellow - findings inconsistent with
  state of downstream molecule; and lines in grey - effect not predicted.
papertitle: The early phase transcriptome of bovine monocyte-derived macrophages infected
  with Staphylococcus aureus in vitro.
