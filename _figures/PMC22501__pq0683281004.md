caption: Nonradioactive in situ hybridization analysis of RDH4 expression in mouse
  embryos during gd 10 and 11. (A) Sagittal section of a gd 10 embryo, at the level
  of the heart, showing expression of RDH4 in the alar plate of the spinal cord. (B)
  Section, parallel to that of A, hybridized with a sense probe showing absence of
  staining, thus verifying the specificity of the in situ hybridization technique.
  (C) Transverse section of a gd 11 embryo, at the level of the genital ridge, showing
  the expression of RDH4 in myotome and migrating muscle progenitor cells in the body
  wall. Expression also was seen in cells of the genital ridge, spinal ganglion, and
  the liver. (D) Sagittal section of a gd 11 embryo showing expression of RDH4 in
  the basal cells of the neuroepithelium of the mesencephalic flexure, and in collections
  of cells in the pons. (E) Frontal section of a gd 11 embryo, showing expression
  of RDH4 in the retina and lens, and also in the neural crest-derived cells of the
  anterior eye segment. (F) Frontal section of a gd 11 embryo, showing a dorso-ventral
  gradient of expression of RDH4 in the mesencephalon and a distinct expression in
  the floor plate. (G) Section through the hind part (just behind the hind limb) of
  a gd 11 embryo showing strongly stained cells in the spinal cord and notochord,
  and in the cells of the dermomyotome in a pattern consistent with an expression
  in a myogenetic cell lineage. Note the   lack of expression in the sclerotome. ap,
  Alar plate; bp, basal plate; cp, neural crest-derived corneal precursor mesenchyme;
  dm, dermomyotome; fp, floor plate; l, liver; m, myocytes; mf, mesencephalic flexure;
  my, myotome; pe, pigment epithelium; p, pons; n, notochord; r, retina; s, sclerotome;
  sc, spinal cord; sg, spinal ganglia; gr, genital ridge. Original magnifications
  were ×80 (A–E and G) and ×40 (F).
