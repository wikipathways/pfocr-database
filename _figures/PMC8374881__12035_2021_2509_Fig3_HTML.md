caption: RSV inhibits the inflammatory response through multiple pathways. RSV hinders
  assembly and stimulation of TLRs by oxidizing degradation of risk factors associated
  with the activation of inflammatory responses, DAMPs and PAMPs, such as ATP and
  ROS. Furthermore, the inhibition of DAMPs and PAMPs prevents the activation of P2X4,
  P2X7, and Pannexin 1, thereby indirectly inhibiting the activation of inflammasomes,
  NLRP2. In addition, RAV is an inhibitor of κB kinase activation, which blocks the
  NF-κB signaling pathway by suppressing p65 activation. RSV significantly reduces
  the inflammatory response and repress astrocyte activation through the above-mentioned
  mechanisms
