caption: 'Cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol synthesis involves a complex chain of
  enzymatic reaction, from acetyl-CoA to the melanovate pathway that then divides
  into two possible pathways: the Bloch and Kandutch-Russel. The main product of cholesterol
  hydroxylation in the brain is the 24S-hydroxycholesterol, it can also be hydroxylated
  into 27-hydroxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol to a lesser extent. ACL, ATP
  citrate lyase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; CH25H, Cholesterol 25 hydroxylase;
