caption: Transcriptional regulation of steroidogenic genes by the NR4A family. The
  promoter regions of CYP11B2 and HSD3B1 contain NR4A family binding sequences such
  as NGFIB and Nurr1, which regulate gene expression of CYP11B2 and HSD3B1 by forming
  a transcription factor complex. (A) Gene expression of CYP11B2 by NR4A family. (B)
  Gene expression of HSD3B1 by NR4A family. Although p300, SRC-1, and PARP1 have been
  reported as components of the complex, other components are still unknown.
