caption: A proposed working model of LrHSP17.2 involved in resistance to abiotic stress.
  When Lilium regale suffers from abiotic stress, LrHSP17.2 is rapidly induced, and
  its protein can exert a chaperone function. This includes improving antioxidant
  enzyme activity and promoting the folding and formation of transcription factor
  proteins, thereby regulating hormone synthesis pathway genes, antioxidant enzyme
  genes, and stress-response genes
