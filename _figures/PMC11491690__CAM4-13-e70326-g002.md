caption: HOXA9/MEIS1 and FBXO22 promotion of KMT2A‐r acute leukemia. One of the main
  ways that KMT2A‐r acute leukemia works is by activating HOXA cluster genes, especially
  HOXA9 and MEIS1. The fusion proteins that are created when the KMT2A gene breaks
  and fuses with another gene make these genes more active. KMT2A‐r acute leukemias
  often have the ability to renew themselves. FBXO22 protein helps KMT2A‐r acute leukemia
  cells to renew themselves by increasing the degradation of BACH1. Since an elevated
  expression of BACH1 inhibits the cancer process, low levels in cells are associated
  with self‐renewal and lack of cell differentiation. By binding to and stabilizing
  β‐catenin, FOXM1 aids in maintaining the activity of the Wnt/β‐catenin signaling
  pathway, which encourages leukemia stem cells to self‐renew
