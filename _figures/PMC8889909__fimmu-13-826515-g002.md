caption: 'Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). There are two phases in the PPP: oxidative
  and non-oxidative. G6P-dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phosphogluconolactonase, and 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (PGD) convert G6P into CO2, ribulose-5-phosphate, and NADPH during
  the oxidative phase to maintain redox balance under stressful conditions. In the
  non-oxidative phase, enzymes such as ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, ribulose-5-phosphate
  3-epimerase, a transketolase, and a transaldolase convert ribulose-5-phosphate to
  nucleic acids, sugar phosphate precursors, or glycolytic precursors such as fructose-6-phosphate
  (F6P) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). PPP and glycolysis share a pool of G3P
  and F6P, resulting in lactate or pyruvate production.'
