caption: During normal cellular conditions, BRD4 recognizes acetylated lysine residues
  on histones and recruits positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to
  promote transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II of key oncogenic drivers
  such as MYC. BET inhibition (BETi) prevents acetyl lysine binding by the bromodomains
  on BRD4 and abrogates expression of MYC. In resistant cells, however, repression
  of the Wnt pathway by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is dampened. Together
  with its target genes, Wnt signaling is able to restore expression of genes such
  as MYC and promote resistance to BET inhibition.
