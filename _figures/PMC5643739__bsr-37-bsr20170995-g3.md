caption: FIP-1 plays a role in cell signalling through its involvement in intracellular
  trafficking of macromolecules. FIP-2 is involved in the TNF-α signalling pathway.
  FIP-3 is a regulatory protein of the NFκB pathway. FIP-4 is a proapoptotic molecule
  located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (adapted from []).
