caption: Schematic model of a possible molecular network between RASSF1A, the Hippo-kinases
  LATS1 and LATS2, the Hippo kinase effector YAP1, FOXM1 and ERα based on the findings
  in this paper and on the published literature. (A) RASSF1A is a key regulator of
  the Hippo signaling pathway. In this study, we observed that RASSF1A-mediated suppression
  of YAP1 and YAP1 inhibition correlates with reduced expression of FOXM1 and ERα
  in ERα-positive breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that decreased
  expression of YAP1, FOXM1 and ERα correlates with induction of senescence, reduced
  colony formation and inhibition of cancer cell growth. FOXM1 and ERα play important
  roles in the regulation of proliferation, function and development of normal breast
  epithelium. Increased expression and aberrations in the function or expression of
  these proteins are associated with luminal breast cancer initiation, progression
  and drug resistance. Based on our findings, we suggest that in normal breast tissue,
  RASSF1A keeps expression and function of FOXM1 and ERα under control, thereby suppressing
  luminal breast cancer initiation and progression in a LATS1-, LATS2- and YAP1-dependent
  manner. In normal breast epithelium, RASSF1A is expressed without inducing senescence.
  We speculate that RASSF1A only causes down-regulation of FOXM1 and ERα after being
  activated e.g., through mitogenic stimuli or under the influence of hormones such
  as estrogen. It was shown that RASSF1A is phosphorylated by ATM kinase as a consequence
  of DNA damage or mitotic replication stress. Phosphorylation facilitates interaction
  of RASSF1A with MST2 leading to activation of the Hippo pathway. The outcome of
  RASSF1A on YAP1 function or stabilization might be dependent on the cellular context.
  It was reported that RASSF1A causes YAP1-dependent expression of pro-apoptotic genes
  as a consequence of RASSF1A-mediated activation of the Hippo pathway. However, it
  was also reported that phosphorylation of YAP1 by LATS1/2 causes its cytoplasmic
  retention followed by proteasomal destruction, suggesting that RASSF1A might also
  suppress YAP1 through fostering its proteasomal degradation. Here, we show that
  RASSF1A decreases the levels of YAP1 and, as a consequence, suppression of FOXM1
  and ERα expression and senescence in ERα-driven breast cancer cells. Interestingly,
  it was reported that YAP1 suppresses RASSF1A by fostering its proteasomal destruction.
  Thus, it is conceivable that RASSF1A and YAP1 mutually antagonize each other and
  that a regulatory feedback loop exists between both proteins. Loss of RASSF1A or
  aberrations in the function of the Hippo-kinases LATS1 and 2 might shift the balance
  towards an increased activation of YAP1, FOXM1 and ERα fostering luminal breast
  cancer initiation and progression. (B) We observed that RASSF1A-mediated suppression
  of YAP1, FOXM1 and ERα depends on the Hippo-kinases LATS1 and LATS2. This observation
  is in accordance with reports showing that LATS kinases are important for control
  of ERα activity and in suppression of luminal breast cancers. (C) We observed in
  the absence of RASSF1A that the levels of the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 are increased
  and that YAP1 affects expression and activity of ERα and FOXM1 even in the presence
  of LATS1 and LATS2. Based on our findings, we suggest that RASSF1A and LATS1 and
  2 cooperate in suppressing YAP1 and inhibiting FOXM1 and ERα expression. FOXM1 is
  a key regulator of cell cycle progression and an activator of ERα expression. Thus,
  deregulated FOXM1 expression leads to uncontrolled proliferation and resistance
  against senescence.
