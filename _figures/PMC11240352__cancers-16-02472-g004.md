caption: Cetuximab mechanism of action and summary of how RAC1 and RAC1B could contribute
  to the known mechanisms of cetuximab resistance in CRC. Treatment with cetuximab
  prevents the activation of EGFR kinase domains, preventing receptor phosphorylation
  and activation of downstream signaling cascades. Cetuximab also promotes the internalization
  and degradation of the receptor, and together, these mechanisms lead to cell-cycle
  arrest and apoptosis. Alternatively, RAC1 and RAC1B can contribute to known cetuximab
  resistance mechanisms through activation by other RTKs, and by perpetuating downstream
  EGFR signaling pathways, promoting receptor recycling to the membrane following
  internalization and promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Figure created
