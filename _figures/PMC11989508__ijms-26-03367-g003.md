caption: In PD, the molecular mechanism of ERS involves the interaction of multiple
  factors. The vicious cycle between alpha syn and ERS, where gene mutations or abnormal
  aggregation of alpha syn (such as A53T, A30P) lead to misfolding and the formation
  of LBs, directly triggering ERS (upregulation of GRP78 and CHOP expression). Meanwhile,
  ERS activates the UPR pathway, further promoting alpha syn aggregation and forming
  a positive feedback loop. Knocking out FAM171A2 can block the pathological spread
  of α-syn and improve symptoms. PET tracer [18F]-F0502B can visualize alpha syn aggregation.
  LRRK2 gene mutations drive ERS through the THBS1/TGF-β1 pathway. Common LRRK2 mutations
  (such as G2019S) enhance kinase activity, upregulate THBS1 expression, and bind
  to TGF-β1 to activate its signaling pathway, disrupting UPR homeostasis and leading
  to elevated ERS markers and mitochondrial damage. The synergistic protective effect
  of Parkin and PINK1, ERS-induced Parkin expression, clears misfolded proteins through
  the UPS and initiates mitochondrial autophagy, reducing the ERS burden; PINK1 regulates
  mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and synergizes with Parkin to clear damaged mitochondria
  and reduce ROS production. Lack of Parkin or PINK1 can exacerbate ERS sensitivity
  and neuronal apoptosis. (“p” represents phosphorylation; ↑ represents increase;
