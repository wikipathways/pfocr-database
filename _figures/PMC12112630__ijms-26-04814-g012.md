caption: The miR-17-92 cluster acts as a central oncogenic hub in Ewing’s sarcoma,
  directly activated by the EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein. By targeting key components
  of the TGFB/BMP signaling pathway, including CTGF, FOSL2, and BAMBI, miR-17-92 modulates
  the tumor microenvironment and suppresses differentiation signals, thereby promoting
  tumorigenesis. These findings suggest that therapeutic inhibition of miR-17-92 may
  restore tumor-suppressive pathways and represent a potential strategy for targeted
  treatment
