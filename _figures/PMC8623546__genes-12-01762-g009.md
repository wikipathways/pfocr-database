caption: 'Hedgehog (Hh) signalling: (A) In an unbound state, patched (PTCH1) is localised
  in the cilia. In the absence of bound Hh ligands, full-length GLI family zinc finger
  3 (GLI3) protein (GLI-FL) is proteolytically cleaved to form a repressed form of
  GLI3 (GLI3-R) which represses the expression of downstream genes controlled by Hh
  pathway. (B) When Hh ligands bind to PTCH1, it translocates out of the cilium. Simultaneously,
  smoothened (SMO), translocates and enriches into the ciliary compartment. SMO activates
  the GLI transcription factors GLI-A (made of GLI1 and GLI2). GLI-A translocates
  into the nucleus where its dynamic balance with GLI-R determines the output of downstream
  Hh genes (Modified and redrawn using BioRender.com []).'
