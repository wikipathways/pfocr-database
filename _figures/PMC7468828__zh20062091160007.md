caption: Model of signaling mechanisms mediating the protective effects of monophosphoryl
  lipid A (MPLA) on the medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL) during sepsis. Sepsis
  and LPS stimulate the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1 (IRAK-1)-ERK signaling pathway. This pathway diverges to mediate both inhibition
  of MTAL  absorption (, , ) and stimulation of TNF-α production. Pretreatment with
  MPLA prevents both effects by activating a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
  pathway that inhibits MyD88-dependent ERK activation (see text for details). Arrows
  do not necessarily imply direct relationships; regulatory steps may involve additional
  signaling components. TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing
  adaptor-inducing interferon-β.
