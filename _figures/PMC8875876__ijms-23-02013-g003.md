caption: The brain-to-gut effects of activation of the autonomic nervous system in
  response to chronic stress. Exposure to stress activates the sympatho–adrenomedullary
  system which results in the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla via
  activation of the splanchnic nerve []. Catecholamines released by the adrenal medulla
  exert various effects on different peripheral organs, however they may also travel
  via the circulation to the gut where they may diffuse into the lumen and modulate
  the gut microbiota []. Exposure to stress also exerts effects over the enteric nervous
  system (ENS), by driving activation of sympathetic nerve terminals which release
  catecholamines that bind adrenergic receptors in the ENS, thus modulating intestinal
  motility and permeability []. Chronic stress also inhibits the vagus nerve. This
  results in increased splenic TNF-α release, exacerbated by Substance-P-driven responses
  by intrinsic nerves of the ENS []. Inhibition of the vagus nerve by chronic stress
  also inhibits the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, stimulating TNF-α release
  by macrophages in the gut []. This increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines may lead
  to intestinal inflammation, compromising intestinal barrier integrity, but may also
  modulate the gut microbiota [,].
