caption: 'Figure 8. Regulatory role of the EIF2AK3-EIF2S1-ATF4 pathway in autophagy
  in tumor cells undergoing ER stress. ER stress induces EIF2AK3-EIF2S1 phosphorylation
  and ATF4 activation, which induces LC3 transcription and stimulates autophagy. Activation
  of ATF4 also promotes autophagy by activating DDIT4, which increases EEF2K activity
  by inhibiting the negative regulation of MTOR on EEF2K. When autophagy is not sufficient
  to reduce ER stress, cells may undergo ER stress-mediated cell death by apoptosis.
  Full line: direct regulation; dotted line: indirect regulation.'
