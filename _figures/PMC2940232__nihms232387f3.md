caption: 'Radiation-induced redistribution and accelerated repopulation employs the
  developmental Notch pathway. (A): In breast cancer, ionizing radiation induces the
  expression of Notch receptor ligands on the surface of nontumorigenic cells and
  possibly other nonmalignant stem cells niche cells like, for example, endothelial
  cells, which are finally depleted by radiation. Activation of Notch signaling in
  CSCs may than redistribute quiescent CSCs into the cell cycle in a symmetric type
  of stem cell division and finally cause repopulation of the tumor. (B): In this
  model system, TGF-β is produced by the mass of the nontumorigenic, radiosensitive
  cancer cells and activated by radiation. It antagonizes the proliferative effects
  of Notch, which is activated in CSCs through interaction with their niche. During
  the course of fractionated irradiation, most of the nontumorigenic cancer cells
  are killed. This causes TGF-β levels to drop while Notch is still being activated,
  resulting in increased regrowth rates and thus accelerated repopulation. Abbreviation:
  CSCs, cancer stem cells.'
