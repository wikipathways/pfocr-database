caption: Model of alterations induced on SIRT1/PGC-1α pathway by AβOs. (A). Healthy
  neuronal conditions were energy depletion and/or decreased catabolic rates can be
  sensed by SIRT1 promoting the PGC-1α deacetylation (1). Transcription and co-activates
  of factors like NRF- 1/2 for the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes
  and dynamic mitochondrial proteins, requires of PGC-1α translocation (2). Coordinated
  mitochondrial dynamics (3, fission/fusion), depends of adequate expression of Mfn1,
  Drp1. (B). In AβOs treated neurons, the PGC-1α is unable to be deacetylated and
  to translocate to the nucleus (4). The expression of key genes is loss (5), and
  imbalance between fusion and fission to promote the granular mitochondrial phenotype
  (6) and neuronal death.
