caption: Molecular mechanisms of the JAK-STAT pathway in CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis,
  migration, and invasion. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in
  promoting CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, migration, and invasion
  through interactions with various oncogenic molecules. For instance, circSPARC functions
  as a miR-485-3p sponge, leading to the upregulation of JAK2 and subsequent phosphorylation
  of STAT3, which enhances cell viability and invasiveness. BRD4, via IKK-α phosphorylation,
  interacts with STAT3 to facilitate DNA damage repair and tumor progression. Inflammatory
  cytokines such as IL-6 and NF-κB further activate STAT3, driving cancer cell survival
  and metastasis. Additionally, APC mutations fuel JAK-STAT signaling through the
  Wnt/MYC pathway, while VDR deficiency and gut microbiota dysbiosis amplify JAK2-STAT3
  hyperactivation, further contributing to CRC development. Furthermore, molecules
  like progranulin, ∆133p53, and RhoA reinforce STAT3 signaling, driving CRC progression
  and promoting resistance to apoptosis
