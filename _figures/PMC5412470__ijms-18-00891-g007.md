  Upon YAP interaction with AmotL2, YAP shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
  AmotL2 acts as a negative regulator of YAP by inducing its cytoplasmic retention
  or targeting it to cell junctions (1); Within the nucleus, YAP functions as a transcriptional
  coactivator of TEAD. The YAP-TEAD complex promotes the transcription of many genes
  that encode pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic proteins. AmotL2 functions as a

  genes, and possibly other targets (3); Cytosolic FKBP51 interacts with glucocorticoid
  hormone receptor (GR) and HSP90. Upon binding, the GR heterocomplex exchanges FKBP51
  for FKBP52. FKBP52-GR–chaperone complex is able to interact with dynein and walk
  by cytoskeletal tracts through cytosol and, through the nuclear pore, get into the
  nucleus, where dissociates and facilitates binding of the steroid-activated receptor
  to promoter sites (4); In its scaffolding function, IQGAP1 interacts with the MEK-ERK

  and proliferation through IQGAP1-TOR-Akt and suppresses differentiation and apoptosis
