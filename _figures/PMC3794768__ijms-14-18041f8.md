caption: The proposed mechanisms for ziyuglycoside II induced cell cycle arrest and
  apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 cells. Ziyuglycoside II increased the accumulation of ROS,
  which resulted in the up-regulated expression of p53, p21 and Bax but down regulated
  expression of Bcl-2 in MDA-MB-435 cells. Consequently, the mitochondrial membrane
  potential (MMP) was reduced and then accelerated the release of cytochrome c into
  cytoplasm leading to the apoptosis of MDA-MB-435 cells via the caspase-3 and caspase-9
  dependent pathway.
