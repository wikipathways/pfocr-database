caption: Schematic representation of the functional connections between the IR and
  IGF-R signaling axis. The binding of insulin-like growth factors 1/2 (IGF-1/2) to
  their receptor insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R) initiates a signaling
  cascade that ultimately leads to cell growth and division. In contrast, insulin
  binds with the insulin receptor (IR) to regulate glucose metabolism and maintain
  blood sugar levels. IR dimers and IGF-1R dimers can combine to form hybrid receptors
  capable of binding with insulin and IGF-1/2. These hybrid receptors, known as IR/IGF-1R
  hybrid receptors, play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes
  such as cell growth, metabolism, and survival. IGF-2R does not activate any downstream
  signaling pathways
