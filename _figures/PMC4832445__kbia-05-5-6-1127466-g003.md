caption: GPI-APs in integrin activation and signaling at the uropod. GPI-APs co-cluster
  with activated integrins following integrin activation and/or ligand binding as
  well as after antibody-mediated GPI-AP ligation. CD157 and the prion protein (PrP)
  are two GPI-APs that localize to the uropod of polarized leukocytes and regulate
  integrin-mediated adhesion and intracellular signaling. These effects might be mediated
  through lateral associations of GPI-APs with integrins, by which GPI-APs may promote
  integrin activation and/or recruitment to lipid rafts. Some of the pathways known
  to be regulated by PrP and/or CD157 include Src-family kinases (SFK), mitogen activated
  protein kinases (MAPK) and the survival kinase Akt. In addition, PrP regulates actin
  dynamics by the RhoA-cofilin pathway. Since GPI-APs lack cytoplasmic domains, it
  has been postulated that they transmit signals by lateral association with transmembrane
  proteins. In the case of integrin-mediated adhesion, it is unclear whether GPI-AP-dependent
  signaling is downstream or upstream of integrin activation/clustering. A possibility
  is that GPI-AP regulate RhoGTPases by integrin-independent pathways to induce local
  changes in actin dynamics that impact on integrin activation and microclustering.
