caption: Schematic of death receptor signaling pathways for TNF-α, FasL, and TRAIL
  with ultimate cell fate outcomes shown (survival outcomes boxed in green, death
  outcomes boxed in red). Also indicated in three levels of red fill color (based
  on RNA −log10 p values) are components that are upregulated in the TCGA database
  for TN-BC compared with ER-positive BC. While three levels of blue fill color (based
  on RNA −log10 p values) are components that are downregulated in the TCGA database
  for TN-BC compared with ER-positive BC. Components in white fill are not indicated
  in the report. The yellow drug capsule represents the small-molecule IAP antagonists
  known as Smac mimetics (SMs), which have multiple effects illustrated here. SMs
  induce the degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 thereby stopping TNF-α/TNFR1 triggered
  RIPK1 ubiquitination that blocks NF-κB and AP-1 activation and shunts RIPK1 into
  death complexes, referred to as the ripoptosome (RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-8) or
  the necrosome (RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL). SMs can also derepress XIAP’s ability to
  inhibit caspase-3, which sensitizes cells to FasL- or TRAIL-induced killing. SMs
  can also cause the induction of TNF-α through the activation of the alternative
  NF-κB pathway (not illustrated here). Activated caspase-8 is able to suppress necroptosis
  by cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3 proteins.
