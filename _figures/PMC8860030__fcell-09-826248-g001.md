caption: 'LD Biogenesis. From a biophysical perspective, LD biogenesis can be described
  as a four-step process. (A) Nucleation occurs when the ER bilayer saturates with
  NL, reaching a concentration in the bilayer to form lenses of the size in the order
  of nanometers. The PL composition and seipin among other proteins modulates this
  process through bilayer hydration, bending and curvature. (B) The individual lens
  growth takes place as newly synthesized NL are incorporated and by ripening and
  fusion between lenses; seipin prevents NL from shedding. (C) Budding is a spontaneous
  process (dewetting) driven by the interfacial tensions that come into play surrounding
  the droplet. The bilayer tension and the phospholipid asymmetry determine the sphericity
  and direction of budding, respectively. FIT has been recently proposed to be involved
  in the maintenance of the appropriate PL composition in each ER hemi-layer. (D)
  Although detachment is not to be expected for all LD, it is a reversible process.
  COPI has been proposed to be involved in the detachment/re-attachment process to
  the ER membrane. (E) Metabolic reactions more closely affecting NL synthesis and
  its modulating pathway SREBP. Note: the scheme represents a simplification of the
  metabolic vias according to the available evidence regarding the revised pathologies.
