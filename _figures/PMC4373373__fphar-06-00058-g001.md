caption: Feedback mechanisms mediated by the extracellular cAMP–adenosine cascade.
  Activation of receptors coupled to Gs protein (GsPCR) leads to stimulation of adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) and increased generation of cAMP, which may elicit localized cellular
  response via activation of effectors such as PKA or Epac (A,B), which are organized
  in microdomains via anchoring proteins, such as AKAP. cAMP may be hydrolyzed by
  intracellular phosphodiesterases (PDEs) or may leave the cell via multidrug resistance
  proteins (MRPs). Outside the cell, ecto-PDE and ecto-5′nucleotidase sequentially
  convert cAMP to AMP and adenosine (ADO), which may activate Gs-coupled A2A/A2B(A)
  or Gi-coupled A1/A3(B) receptors, increasing or attenuating cAMP production, respectively.
  In addition, activation of receptors coupled to Gi protein (GiPCR) results in inhibition
  of Gi-sensitive ACs reducing both generation and eﬄux of cAMP (C), with consequent
  loss of autocrine/paracrine feedback signaling of extracellular cAMP.
