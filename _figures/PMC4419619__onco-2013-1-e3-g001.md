caption: The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), a transmembrane receptor
  tyrosine kinase, is activated by its cognate ligands, insulin-like growth factor-1
  (IGF-1) and -2 (IGF-2), resulting in receptor auto-transphosphorylation and signaling
  cascades that progress through the IRS-l/PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. Stimulation
  of both pathways ultimately leads to various cancer promoting phenotypes including
  cellular proliferation, survival, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. Specific
  IGF-1R mediated activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway results in a pro-survival signal
  that has been shown to promote resistance to both chemotherapy-induced apoptosis
  or to molecular targeted therapies (Target X).
