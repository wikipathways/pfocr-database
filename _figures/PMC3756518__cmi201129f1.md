caption: Schematic of the simplified B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway simulated
  in our Monte Carlo method. Antigen may bind to BCR with probability pon(BA) (a).
  If the same antigen molecule has stayed bound to the BCR for a threshold length
  of time µ (b), Lyn may bind to either the Ig-α or Ig-β subunit with probability
  pon(Lyn) (c) and phosphorylate both with probability pphos(Ig-α) and pphos(Ig-β),
  respectively (d). Once the Ig-α or Ig-β subunits are phosphorylated (e), Syk may
  bind to them with probability pon(Syk) (f) and become phosphorylated with probability
  pphos(Syk) (g). Syk may detach with probability poff(Syk) (h) regardless of the
  outcome of the phosphorylation trial. Subsequent antigen binding may occur, but
  without any consequences as far as the phosphorylation of the Ig-α or Ig-β subunits
  is concerned (h).
