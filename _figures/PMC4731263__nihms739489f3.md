caption: (A) ABPP has been successfully used to develop selective small-molecule inhibitors
  against enzymes involved the synthesis and degradation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol
  (2-AG). Selective DAGL inhibitors KT109 and KT172 and selective MAGL inhibitors
  JZL184, KML29, and MJN110 have been used to not only identify that DAGL and MAGL
  regulate endocannabioid metabolism and signaling, but also to show that this pathway
  controls arachidonic metabolism that fuels pro-inflammatory prostaglandin synthesis.
  (B) ABPP was used to develop the selective DDHD2 inhibitor KLH45, which was used
  to show that the previously uncharacterized enzyme DDHD2 was the primary triacylglycerol
  (TAG) hydrolase in the brain, and that inhibiting this enzyme led to accumulation
  in brain triacylglycerol levels and accumulation of lipid droplets. (C) ABPP was
  used to develop the selective ABHD16A inhibitor KC01 to determine that ABHD16A was
  the primary phosphatidylserine (PS) hydrolase that generates the pro-inflammatory
  signaling lipid lyso-PS, which is in-turn hydrolyzed by ABHD12. Previous studies
  had shown that ABHD12 inactivation caused a neurodegenerative disease known as PHARC.
  ABHD16A inhibition protected mice from the neurotoxicological markers associated
  with PHARC. (D) Lipid aldehydes such as HNE were competed against the cysteine-reactive
  iodoacetamide-alkyne (IAyne) probe and coupled to the isoTOP-ABPP platform to map
  the direct protein targets of HNE. HNE showed selective interactions with certain
  sites such as the active-site proximal cysteine of ZAK, leading to ZAK inhibition
  and JAK inactivation. (E) Reactive environmental chemicals, such as the fungicide
  chlorothalonil (CTN) were competed against IAyne to map direct protein targets of
  these chemicals, leading to the discovery that CTN binds to and inhibits multiple
  enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation.
