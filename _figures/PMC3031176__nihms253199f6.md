caption: Proposed schema which depicts our hypothesis for tumor necrosis factor-α-induced
  increase in the expression and activity of p27kip and caspase-3 via JNK-FoxO1 to
  induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively, in smooth muscle cells of
  human carotid plaques. However, FoxO1 may also undergo phosphorylation through PI3K-Akt
  pathway, and p-FoxO1 is then sequestered by chaperone protein, 14-3-3, and exported
  to the cytoplasm in SMCs. Thus, the latter signal would act as a negative feedback
  signal and protect smooth muscle cells and thus increase plaque stability.
