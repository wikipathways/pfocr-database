caption: 'Response mechanism of endogenous JA to abiotic stress. Note: Positive regulatory
  actions or under light conditions are indicated by arrows and by lines and bars
  under dark conditions. Double slashes indicate that the process cannot proceed.
  Salt, drought, or heavy metal stress conditions induce oxidative stress due to elevated
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation levels. The JA produced facilitates stress
  tolerance by modulating major enzymatic components (SOD and APX) of antioxidant
  defense systems. In light, the secretion of extra-floral nectar (EFN) is promoted
  by JA and jasmonate isoleucine conjugate (JA-Ile). Conversely, no light inhibits
  the secretion of EFN by JA, but not JA-Ile. Far-red (FR) light induces phytochrome
  A (phyA) and activities of the JA singling pathway. SOD: superoxide dismutase; APX:
  ascorbate peroxidase.'
