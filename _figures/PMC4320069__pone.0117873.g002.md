caption: The IPA Upstream Regulator tool was used to identify potential upstream regulators
  based on the statistical significance of genes in the gene list that function downstream
  of this regulator. The top 5 upstream regulators identified were androgen, androgen
  receptor (AR), lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), hedgehog (HH), and cadmium
  chloride. Upstream regulators (red); AR was both and upstream regulator and on the
  gene list (purple shading); genes from the gene list (blue).
