caption: 'Metabolites and their metabolic pathway networks measured by the Arg/Thiol
  Redox Metabolomics Assay. The assay covers nearly all Arg metabolic pathways (rectangle),
  including the arginase, Cit-NO cycle, and polaymine pathways (hexagon). Also shown
  are sulfur amino acid derived sulfhydryl containing redox metabolites (grey ovals),
  and names of enzymes involved in the synthesis pathways. Argininosuccinate (dotted
  rectangle box) was not measured. Some major amino acids (circles) were measured
  but are not shown in this figure (See Table  for a complete list of analytes quantified).
  Compounds that were significantly decreased or increased after 24 hrs of treatment
  with LPS (1000 ng/ml) are highlighted with - or +, respectively. Abbreviations:
