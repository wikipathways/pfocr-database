caption: 'The four different types of innate immune signalling pathways recognised
  in I. elegans. Differentially expressed genes/proteins are represented with red
  colour boxes. a The Toll immune pathway: exposure to bacterial and fungal peptidoglycans
  trigger the production of insect peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), like
  PGRP-SA, PGRP-SC1 and PGRP-SD, which in co-operation with Gram-negative binding
  proteins (GNBPs) like GNBP-1 and GNBP-3, activates proteases Spaetzle (a cytokine-like
  protein); which in turn activates Toll. Activated Toll activates Dorsal and Dif
  transcription factors, which then enter into the nucleus, bind to NfkB sites and
  initiate the transcription of antimicrobial peptides that kill Gram-positive bacteria
  and fungi by degrading their cell walls. b In the Imd pathway, exposure to meso-diaminopimelic
  acid (DAP) type peptidoglycan produced by Gram-negative bacteria activates PGRP-LE
  and PGRP-LC, which in turn activates Imd. Activated Imd further activates Fas-associated
  death domain (FADD) and death related ced-3/nedd2-like caspase (DREDD), which then
  activates Relish transcription factor. This enters into the nucleus and induce transcription
  of antimicrobial peptides detrimental for Gram-negative bacteria. c JAK/STAT cytokine
  receptor activation caused by unpaired ligands released during infection and injury
  causes phosphorylation of JAK tyrosine kinase Hopscotch (Hop). The phosphorylated
  Hop phosphorylate stat 92e, which then dissociate from receptor, dimerize, enters
  into the nucleus and induces transcription of Thiosester-containing protein genes
  (Teps) and Turandot (Tot) stress genes. d Prophenol-oxidase cascades are triggered
  upon exposure to bacterial (Lys and DAP peptidoglycan) and fungal (1, 3-beta-D-glucan)
  cell wall components. Activation of cascade produces PGPRs (PGRP-S, PGRP-LE and
  PGRP-1), which generate antimicrobial products like melanin and reactive oxygen
  species for defence. Refer Fig.  and Additional file : Sheet 8–11 for differential
  up-regulation components of immune system'
