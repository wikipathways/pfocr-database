caption: Mechanical stimulation as an influencing factor of bone-derived factors.
  OCN rises within 1 hour after mechanical stimulation, and through the participation
  of actin binding protein cofilin, it promotes ASR, memory and muscle function. Mechanical
  stimulation also promotes the content of OPN, the Akt1 signaling pathway can promote
  bone remodeling caused by mechanical stress and hypertension-related vascular remodeling.
  The relationship between SOST content and mechanical stimulation is that SOST rises
  sharply after short-term mechanical stimulation and then drops below the baseline
  level. Long-term stimulation slows down the increase of SOST, which has an inhibitory
  effect. SOST promotes bone resorption and improves the bone density and microstructure
  of CKD rats through the Wnt signaling pathway. FGF23 rises briefly after receiving
  mechanical stimulation, and then drops to the baseline level slowly. Through Klotho-FGF23
  signaling pathway, the activation of bone cells is enhanced and parameters of uremia
  will be improved.

  description: Mechanical stimulation as an influencing factor of bone-derived factors.
    OCN rises within 1 hour after mechanical stimulation, and through the participation
    of actin binding protein cofilin, it promotes ASR, memory and muscle function.
    Mechanical stimulation also promotes the content of OPN, the Akt1 signaling pathway
    can promote bone remodeling caused by mechanical stress and hypertension-related
    vascular remodeling. The relationship between SOST content and mechanical stimulation
    is that SOST rises sharply after short-term mechanical stimulation and then drops
    below the baseline level. Long-term stimulation slows down the increase of SOST,
    which has an inhibitory effect. SOST promotes bone resorption and improves the
    bone density and microstructure of CKD rats through the Wnt signaling pathway.
    FGF23 rises briefly after receiving mechanical stimulation, and then drops to
    the baseline level slowly. Through Klotho-FGF23 signaling pathway, the activation
