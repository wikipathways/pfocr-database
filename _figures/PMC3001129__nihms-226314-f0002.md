caption: NOD1 and NOD2 recognize peptidoglycan fragments released either during bacterial
  division within the cytosol or by the lysosome during the degradation of phagocytosed
  bacteria. Activation of either NOD1 or NOD2 leads to the recruitment and activation
  of RIP2, which results in MAPK pathway and NF-κB activation. NLRP12 acts to silence
  MAPK and NF-κB activation. These pathways are also activated by the recognition
  of bacterial components by TLRs. NLRP12 inhibits the phosphorylation of interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1), therefore blocking MAPK and NF-κB activation.
  CIITA is a transcriptional factor induced by IFNγ signaling pathways. CIITA binds
  to the enhanceosome and is the master regulator of MHC II expression. NLRX1 function
  and localization is controversial and there are two potential mechanisms of action,
  which are not mutually exclusive. The first proposes that NLRX1 is imported into
  the mitochondrial matrix by TOM/TIM. Once in the matrix, the mitochondrial leader
  sequence is cleaved from the N-terminal sequence and NLRX1 interacts with the core
  II protein (UQRC2) of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This interaction
  results in the production of ROS, which activate JNK and NF-kB signaling pathways.
  The second proposes that NLRX1 is localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane,
  where it interacts with MAVS. This interaction prevents MAVS from interacting with
  RIG-I when it senses viral RNA. The resulting effect is the inhibition of immune
  responses induced by viral RNA recognition.
