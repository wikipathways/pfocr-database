caption: Contribution of chronic hyperglycaemia to increased polyol pathway flux and
  diabetic kidney disease progression. Increased polyol pathway nux increases oxidative
  stress, activates the mitogcn-activatcd protein kinase (MAPK), rapidly accelerates
  fibrosareoma (Raf), mitogcn­activated protein kinase (MEK), extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases I and 2 (ERKl/2), and transcription factors activator protein-I (AP-I).
  Increased oxidative stress increases intracellular fructose, causes diacylglycerol
  (DAG) accumulation, protein kinase C (PKC)/nicotinamide adenine dinuclcotidc phosphate
  (NADPH) oxidasc activation, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS further
  activates adcnyl cyclase through a series of reactions that culminates in increased
  transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). AP-I and PKC activation also results in
  high expression of TGF-β. All of which results in extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation.
  glomcrular basement membrane (GHM) thickening. and ultimately DKD development
