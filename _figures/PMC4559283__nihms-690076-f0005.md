caption: (Left) List of neuro-diseases and disorders in which GFAP and/or GFAP-BDP
  is released into biofluid. (Right) Schematic showing how GFAP BDP is generated after
  TBI and how both GFAP-BDP and to a lesser extent intact GFAP are released into interstitial
  fluid (ISF)/extracellular fluid. From there, these proteins diffused into the subarachnoid
  CSF []. GFAP-BDP/GFAP then either drain directly into the veins (glymphatic pathway,
  dashed arrows) or continue to follow the CSF flow through the ventricles and then
  enter the circulation by diffusing through the BBB. Blood-based GFAP and GFAP-BDP
  can be detected as a biomarker, but they also can serve as autoantigen, triggering
  autoantibody response in a subset of patients.
