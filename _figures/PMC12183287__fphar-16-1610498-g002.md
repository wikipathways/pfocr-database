caption: BAs contribute to host metabolism in various organs through FXR and TGR5.
  BAs synthesis in the liver and glucose metabolism are regulated by the intestinal
  FXR-FGF15/19 signal, and BAs also affect lipid synthesis in the liver through the
  FXR-SHP signal pathway. In addition, BAs enhance host energy metabolism through
  TGR5, including driving BAT thermogenesis; promoting the conversion of inactive
  thyroxine (T4) to active thyroid hormone (T3) in skeletal muscle to increase energy
  consumption; and promoting the release of GLP-1 and PYY by colon L cells to improve
  IR and suppress appetite. SCFAs promote BAT thermogenesis by activating PGC-1α and
  UCP-1 in adipose tissue. Secondly, SCFAs activate AMPK in the liver, on the one
  hand, SCFAs can downregulate DNL by inhibiting SREBP-1c and thereby reducing the
  expression of ACC and FASN, and on the other hand, they can promote FAO by activating
  PPARα and thereby upregulating the expression of CPT1α. In addition, SCFAs can reduce
  intake by activating GPR41/43 in the intestine to release PYY and GLP-1, and reduce
  lipid uptake through ABCG5/8 and NPC1L1, thereby increasing lipid excretion in the
  feces. TMAO enhances the pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages and the release
  of inflammatory factors. TMAO inhibits the conversion of TC to BAs through the liver
  FXR/SHP signaling pathway. The balance of the intestinal microecology and the diversity
  of GM help to stabilize the intestinal mucosal barrier and immune system. BAs, bile
