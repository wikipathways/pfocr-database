caption: 'The biological network was identified by incorporating the gene expression
  results into Pathway Studio (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD). Oval-shaped symbols
  represent regulated transcripts, square symbols illustrate cellular or molecular
  functions and arrows denote some of their possible interactions. Upregulated transcripts
  are shown in red; purple illustrates downregulated genes. Matrix metalloproteinases
  (hexagonal symbol, center) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade numerous
  extracellular matrix proteins. MAP kinases and other essential kinases play roles
  in the expression of long-term potentiation. Many of the dysregulated genes associated
  with cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling are involved in memory and
  learning processes. Changes in MMP9 activity are a requirement for remodeling of
  extracellular matrix cell adhesion molecules occurring with synaptic plasticity,
  which in turn is necessary for memory consolidation. Abbreviations: HCN-2, hyperpolarization
  activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2; CTGF, Connective Tissue Growth
  Factor; RECK, Reversion-inducing-cycteine-rich protein with kazal motifs; MMP9,
  matrix metalloproteinase 9; EphB4, ephrin receptor B4; LAMB1, laminin beta 1; ITGB6,
  Integrin, beta 6.'
