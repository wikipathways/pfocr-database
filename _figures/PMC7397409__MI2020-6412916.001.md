caption: 'ERS and unfolded protein response (UPR). ATF6, IRE-1α, and PERK are the
  three transmembrane proteins that regulate UPR. GRP78 binds to the three sensor
  proteins under normal state of protein folding, resulting in UPR silencing. As the
  misfolded proteins accumulate, GRP78 dissociates from them and binds to the misfolded
  proteins. Being separated from GRP78, three proteins (ATF6, IRE-1α, and PERK) activate
  the downstream signaling pathway. The activated IRE-1α slices the mRNA of XBP1 to
  form the active transcription factor XBP1s []. XBP1s inhibits the expression of
  CHOP and activates ERAD-mediated unfolded protein degradation []. However, chronic
  ERS initiates the death pathway of IRE-1α, including RIDD, to degrade some intracellular
  mRNA []. Meanwhile, IRE-1α not only interacts with TRAF2 to activate ASK1 and Caspase12
  but also triggers JNK-mediated apoptosis []. Activated PERK can phosphorylate eIF-2α
  to halt mRNA translation, leading to the reduction of the initiation complex for
  the temporary loss of protein synthesis. Phosphorylated eIF-2α triggers ATF4 translation,
  increases the expression of CHOP, and mediates apoptosis []. However, chronic ERS
  induces GADD34 expression to dephosphorylate p-eIF-2α []. Under ERS, ATF6 translocates
  from the ER to the Golgi after being dissociated from GRP78 and obtains transcriptional
  activity through being cleaved by the proteases S1P and S2P. Sliced ATF6 upregulates
  the expression of XBP1, which results in relieving ERS by enhancing ERAD or inhibiting
  the expression of CHOP []. Together, downstream effects after these signaling pathways
  include ERAD of misfolded proteins, inhibition of translation, induction of apoptosis
  or inflammation, and regulation of lipid metabolism. XBP1: X-box binding protein-1;
  CHOP: C/EBP homologous protein; ERAD: ER-associated degradation; RIDD: regulated
  IRE-1α-dependent decay; TRAF2: TNF-receptor associated factor 2; ASK1: apoptosis
  signal-regulating kinase; JNK: Jun N-terminal kinase; eIF-2α: eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α; ATF4: activating transcription factor 4; GADD34: DNA damage-inducible
