caption: Different pathogenic roles of ER-resident and cell surface HLA-B27 dimers.
  ER resident dimers may result in ER stress as a cellular response and lead to activation
  of the unfolded protein response. Cell surface dimers are reported to form following
  the recycling of fully-folded HLA-B27 cell surface molecules via the endocytic pathway,
  and re-express as dimers for presentation to immunoreceptors, including KIR and
  LILR. Enhanced proliferation and survival of KIR3DL2+ CD4+ T cells and increased
  IL-17 production in patients with AS following stimulation with antigen presenting
  cells expressing HLA-B27 homodimers has been previously demonstrated. The majority
  of these cells have been reported to produce TNF-α and IFN-γ. IL-17 has been demonstrated
  to synergize with TNF-α or IFN-γ to promote the release of inflammatory mediators
  and influence bone metabolism, thus demonstrating its important role in the pathogenesis
  of AS. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HLA, human leukocyte antigen; IFN-γ, interferon-γ;
