caption: Model showing mechanism by which angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) inhibits
  the activity of the caveolin-1 (CAV1)/ Ras-related protein 5A (Rab5)/Ras-related
  C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) pathway. CAV1 phosphorylated on tyrosine-14
  (Y14) promotes Rab5 and then Rac-1 activation to increase migration, invasion, and
  metastasis. Non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a phosphatase
  that is part of a multiprotein complex with CAV1 and dephosphorylates CAV1 at Y14.
  Activation of AT2R with the agonist CGP42112 stimulates PTP1B activity and dephosphorylates
  CAV1, which in turn shuts down the CAV1/Rab5/Rac-1 signaling pathway, thereby effectively
  inhibiting CAV1-enhanced migration, invasion, and metastasis.
