caption: 'Sex determination in insect model species, with their phylogenetic relationships
  representing ∼300 million years of evolution. The fruit fly D. melanogaster, the
  housefly M. domestica, the medfly Ceratis capitata and the honeybee Apis mellifera
  share a common pathway (indicated by a grey box) composed of the transformer (tra)
  gene and its downstream target doublesex (dsx). Female spliced tra transcripts (traF)
  give rise to Tra proteins that direct splicing of dsxF mRNAs, production of DsxF
  proteins and female development. When tra is spliced into the male variant, no Tra
  proteins are produced. This results in splicing of male dsxM mRNAs, DsxM proteins
  and male development. A: Sex in the honeybee (A. mellifera) is determined by the
  heterozygosity or homo-/hemizygosity of the csd gene. In females, different Csd
  proteins, derived from a heterozygous csd gene, direct the processing of female
  fem mRNAs (femF) . The fem gene is apparently an orthologue of the tra gene ). Fem
  protein regulates female splicing of dsx, but also self-sustains the female splicing
  of fem. In males, inactive Csd proteins that are derived from the same alleles (homo-
  or hemizygous csd genes) result in a default splicing of fem (femM). (B and C) Models
  of two alternative sex determination systems that co-exist in M. domestica populations
  , . B: Sex is determined by the absence/presence of an unidentified male-determiner
  M. In the absence of M, maternally-derived Md-tra gene products establish an auto-regulative
  loop in females in which Md-Tra protein mediates the production of more female Md-tra
  mRNA. Presence of M impairs this tra auto-regulatory loop and also mediates the
  splicing of male Md-tra mRNAs. C: Sex in M. domestica can also be determined by
  a female determiner. Presence/absence of a tra allele, Md-traD(=FD), determines
  sexual fate. In females, the presence of Md-traD leads to female splice products
  and Md-Tra protein, even in the presence of the male-determiner M . In males, the
  male-determiner M mediates male Md-traM mRNAs in the absence of the Md-traD allele.
  D: Sex in C. capitata ,  is determined by presence/absence of a, thus far, unidentified
  male-determiner M. In the absence of M, maternally-derived Cc-tra gene products
  appear to establish a Cc-tra auto-regulative loop . Presence of M mediates the splicing
  of male Cc-tra transcripts (traM). E: Sex in D. melanogaster is determined by the
  dose of X chromosomes , . Double doses of X in females activate the Sxl gene and
  expression of Sxl proteins. Sxl proteins direct splicing of female traF mRNAs that
  give rise to functional proteins. Sxl proteins also establish an auto-regulatory
  feedback loop by directing splicing of productive female SxlF mRNAs, which maintain
  the female state throughout development. In addition, there is an additional feedback
  activity in which Tra proteins stimulate Sxl positive auto-regulation . In males,
  the single dose of X chromosomes does not direct early Sxl protein expression. As
  a consequence the downstream regulatory decisions do not occur and male dsxM is
  produced. F: The evolutionary relationship of the species used in the comparison
