caption: The glycine, serine and threonine metabolic pathways of the five Pontibacillus
  strains (including P. yanchengensis Y32T, P. marinus BH030004T, P. chungwhensis
  BH030062T, P. halophilus JSM076056T, and P. litoralis JSM072002T) reconstructed
  by KEGG. The green box represents the enzyme shared by all five strains to synthesize
  glycine. The blue boxes denote the enzymes involved in betain synthesis, which were
  found in P. yanchengensis Y32T, P. chungwhensis BH030062T and P. marinus BH030004T.
  The pathway with pink boxes is found only by P. marinus BH030004T and is related
  to ectoine synthesis
