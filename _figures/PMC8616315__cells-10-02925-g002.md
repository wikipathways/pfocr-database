caption: Model of RUNX3, TEAD and YAP interactions in response to serum and cell density.
  Mitogenic stimulation and low cell density lead to RAC1-Trio-mediated inhibition
  of LATS1/2. Unphosphorylated YAP accumulates in the nucleus, interacts with TEAD
  to the exclusion of RUNX3, to activate genes related to proliferation. Under serum
  starvation or high cell density, LATS1/2 phosphorylate YAP, resulting in increased
  cytoplasmic accumulation of phosphorylated YAP. The phosphorylated YAP in the nucleus
  interacts with RUNX3 and disengages from TEAD, resulting in cell cycle arrest and
  tumor suppression. The YAP–TEAD–RUNX3 ternary complex, which could be an intermediate
  between YAP–TEAD and YAP–RUNX3, inhibits TEAD-driven transcription to suppress tumorigenesis.
