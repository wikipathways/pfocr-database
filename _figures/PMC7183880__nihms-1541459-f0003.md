caption: The extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway is activated in the
  dorsal striatum during instrumental learning and may potentially contribute to the
  transcription necessary for synaptic plasticity. (a,b) The tyrosine receptor kinase
  B (TrkB), the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is a potential
  upstream mechanism of ERK activation in both the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and
  dorsolateral striatum (DLS). (a) In the DMS, TrkB activation is necessary for goal-directed
  behavior, (b) whereas in the DLS TrkB activation contributes to habits. In the DLS,
  (b) the proton-gated acid-sensing ion channel isoform ASIC1a activates ERK signaling
  and is necessary for motor learning. It is unknown whether ASIC1a contributes specifically
  to instrumental habit learning.
