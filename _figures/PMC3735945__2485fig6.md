caption: 'Working hypothesis. A: The following scenario might explain the relationship
  between lingual CD36 and preference for lipids in control animals. At the beginning
  of a meal, the LCFA/CD36 complex in the lipid rafts (1) activates the lipid-dependent
  signaling cascade in taste bud cells (2). This event is followed by a progressive
  endocytosis (3) and the degradation of CD36 by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway
  (4). This downregulation is responsible for a gradual enhancement of the orosensory
  detection threshold of lipids, leading to a progressive decrease of the preference
  for fat during a meal. B: Obesity might impair this regulatory cascade by limiting
  the amount of CD36 in lipid rafts and thus, the subsequent signaling and degradation
  of CD36. In consequence, the CD36 levels in the plasma membrane and the related
  signaling cascade remain relatively stable during a meal in obese mice, as the lipid
  detection threshold and preference for fat, in contrast to what occurs in lean animals.'
