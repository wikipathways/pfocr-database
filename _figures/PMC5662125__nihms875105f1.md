caption: A. Primary bile acids can be synthesized by two pathways in hepatocytes.
  The classic bile acid synthesis pathway is considered the primary pathway in humans.
  In this pathway, cholesterol is first converted to 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-HOC)
  by the rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum. 7α-hydroxy-4 cholesten-3-one (C4) is a common precursor for chenodeoxycholic
  acid(CDCA) and cholic acid (CA). Sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) catalyzes the C-12
  hydroxylation of C4, which leads to the synthesis of CA. In the alternative pathway,
  cholesterol is first converted to 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HOC) by mitochondrial
  sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) then catalyzes
  C-7 hydroxylation. The alternative pathway only produces CDCA. B. Cholesterol and
  cholic acid molecular structures.
