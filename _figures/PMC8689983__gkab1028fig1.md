caption: Drugs that potentially target SARS-CoV-2. (A) The pathway ‘Potential therapeutics
  for SARS’ (R-HSA-9679191, https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-9679191) is
  a systematic catalog of drug binding reactions; the binding of dexamethasone and
  other NR3C1 (glucocorticoid receptor) agonists to a complex including NR3C1 protein
  (R-HSA-9678925, https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-9678925), outlined in
  red is enlarged in (B), which also shows the full list of small-molecule NR3C1 agonists
  annotated in Reactome. The effect of this binding on the HSP90 chaperone complex
  (R-HSA-9690534, https://reactome.org/content/detail/R-HSA-9690534) is shown in (C).
