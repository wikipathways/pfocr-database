caption: 'Normal β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) signal transduction via G-coupled
  proteins (canonical), β2-AR desensitization and downregulation, and alternative
  signal transduction mediated by β-arrestin (β-Arr) are shown in (A–C), respectively.
  (A) The Canonical pathway: Ligand binding to the β2-AR causes dissociation of G-protein
  to Gα and Gβγ and activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Traditionally, activation
  of this signaling pathway promotes a Th2-type immune response and an increase in
  Treg cell function that promotes immune response resolution and suppression of inflammation.
  (B) Desensitization and Downregulation: Chronically high SNA in the spleen desensitizes
  and down-regulates β2-AR via G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)1/2/β-arrestin
  (β-Arr) signal transduction that inhibits the p38MAPK pathway, ERK1/2, which prevents
  PKA activity. (C) The activation of the non-canonical β2-AR signaling pathway is
  mediated by a non-G protein mechanism (G protein is uncoupled to the receptor).
  Instead, GRK5/β-arrestin (β-Arr) signal transduction activates the ERK1/2 signaling
  pathways. The consequences for these two signaling pathways for immune responses
  in the spleen are indicated below. Signal transduction by the PKA pathway promotes
  a Th2-type immune response and the generation of Treg cells. In contrast, β2-AR
  signaling via the ERK1/2 pathway drives Th1 and/or Th17 immune responses depending
  on the immune stimulus, and suppression of Treg cell function.'
