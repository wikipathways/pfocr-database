caption: Summary of PPARγ transcriptional mechanisms. In the transactivation pathway
  (top), unliganded PPARγ (green) and RXR (red) complex with co-repressors (CoR; blue)
  on the PPRE of a PPARγ target gene. This leads to active repression in the absence
  of PPARγ ligands. The level of repression and thus the level of basal transcription
  will depend on the cycling of co-repressors on and off the chromatin. Addition of
  endogenous or exogenous ligands induces a change in the complex that dismisses the
  co-repressors and recruits a complex of co-activators (CoA; green), leading to an
  increase in transcription of the target gene. This complex has many components,
  including enzymes that modify histones and mediators linking the PPARγ complex with
  the transcriptional machinery. In the transrepression pathway (bottom), an inflammatory
  stimulus activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes via NF-κB, AP1, and
  other pathways through an association of these factors with their cognate response
  element (inflammatory response element (IRE)). PPARγ ligands exert their anti-inflammatory
  action by association of liganded PPARγ with an “inhibitory complex” (IC; red),
  which decreases expression of the pro-inflammatory genes. Apparently, this does
  not require a PPRE or partnership with RXR. Components of the complex include post-translationally
  modified PPARγ, SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier)-protein ligases, ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzymes, and proteins that link these with co-repressors targeting AP1 and/or NF-κB.
  A comprehensive review of this pathway has been published recently (). FA, fatty
  acid; 15d-PGJ2, 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2.
