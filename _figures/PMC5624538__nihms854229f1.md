caption: A) The disease-state schematic depicts the contributing factors of diet-induced
  NASH that result in decreased FXR and FXR-signaling resulting in the inflammatory
  phenotype that characterizes NASH. B) The disease treatment/prevention pathway represents
  the role of FXR agonism, via experimental FXR-agonists, in inhibiting key factors
  in the inflammatory pathways (Mcp-1, NF-κB, Lcn2, Il-6-mediated CRP, and LPS-mediated
  Saa3 and Sap) or the induction of Lcn13 to inhibit proinflammatory pathways that
  contribute to NASH. (ˇ) represents induction, (−) represents inhibition of subsequent
  factors, and (---) represents proposed regulation
