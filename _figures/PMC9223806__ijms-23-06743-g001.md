caption: 'cAMP signaling pathway and its disruption by bacterial toxins. cAMP is synthesized
  by transmembrane AC (tmAC) (soluble AC, sAC, is not represented here), which are
  activated by the binding of an agonist to a G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
  stimulating the transition of the heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits Gαs into
  its active GTP-bound state (see text for more details). cAMP activates various effectors
  such as protein kinase A (PKA) and guanine nucleotide-exchange Epac, which then
  regulate various cellular processes, including immune system responses. cAMP can
  also activate ion channels. Phosphodiesterases (PDE) regulate the degradation of
  cAMP by catalyzing its conversion into AMP. Bacterial pathogens have developed several
  strategies to manipulate the cAMP levels within host cells to disrupt intracellular
  signaling []: they can inject toxins (in red) into host cells that either alter
  the Gα subunits responsible for activating or inhibiting eukaryotic tmAC, thus preventing
  host cells to properly regulate tmAC enzymatic activity (e.g., pertussis toxin (PT),
  cholera toxin (CT)), or directly produce uncontrolled, toxic levels of cAMP or other
  cNMPs (such as cCMP) once these NC toxins are specifically activated by their eukaryotic
  cofactor.'
