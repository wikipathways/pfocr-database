caption: Odor is detected by Orco/Or42a which triggers release of GABA from the Kurs6
  neuron in the brain. Basal levels of GABA detected by GABAB receptor (GABABR) in
  the lymph gland support progenitor maintenance through IP3 receptor (IP3R), cytosolic
  calcium, and CamKII/CaM. Under wasp infestation, combination of Or49a and Or42a
  produces high levels of GABA secretion from the brain. High GABA is transported
  and internalized by GABA transporter (Gat) after which it is converted through the
  GABA shunt pathway to generate succinate. Succinate stabilizes sima and enhances
  lamellocyte (LM) differentiation. A portion of succinate is utilized by the TCA
  cycle to create ROS for progenitor maintenance. Nutrient including amino acids is
  sensed by the fat body which in turn increases Drosophila insulin-like peptide 2
  (dIlp2) release from the brain insulin producing cells (IPCs). dIlp2 progresses
  insulin receptor (InR) signaling in the MZ which eventually sustains progenitors
  through dTOR and Wnt/wg signaling. Alternatively, Slimfast (Slif) directly uptakes
  amino acids and merges into dTOR pathway. Also, in the PSC, dIlp2 activates InR
  and dTOR to control PSC number. Ambient CO2 is recognized by Gr63a/Gr21a inhibiting
  sima (Hif-α) in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). sima stabilization induces release
  of unpaired 3 (upd3) which is detected by domeless in the fat body. Fat body secrets
  dIlp6 which increases Serrate in the IZ and causes crystal cell differentiation.
