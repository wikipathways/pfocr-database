caption: Transcription of TXNIP is under the control of a protein complex consisting
  of ChREBP (carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein) and MondoA as well as
  the histone acetyltransferase P300. ChREBP is negatively regulated by AMPK. Consequently,
  stimulation of AMPK by AICAR inhibits ChREBP and TXNIP expression, while inhibition
  of AMPK by glucose and BML-275 activates ChREBP and increases TXNIP mRNA levels.
  Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), counteracts P300-mediated histone acetylation, and
  is involved in insulin-mediated downregulation of TXNIP expression. Thus, inhibition
  of PI3K, AKT or HDAC1/3 increases TXNIP mRNA levels. Fatty acids-mediated stimulation
  of insulin secretion occurs via FFAR1/GPR40, a signalling pathway not involved in
  regulation of TXNIP expression. Fatty acids activate AMPK and have an additional
  effect on TXNIP mRNA levels. Fatty acids counteract glucose-induced TXNIP expression
  and ROS elevation, events which do not impede the ER strees-associated lipotoxic
  effect.
