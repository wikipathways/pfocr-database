caption: 'Working model. Loss of Dsc2 promotes cellular transformation and proliferation
  through activation of the Akt/β-catenin signaling pathway. (A1) Down-regulation
  of Dsc2 leads to activation of the EGFR (A2) and PI3K/Akt-dependent activation of
  β-catenin/TCF transcription in colonic epithelial cells. Activation of this pathway
  leads to enhanced cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. The
  contribution of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (C), “solitary” Dsg2, or the additional
  prosurvival targets of Akt that may enhance tumorigenicity of Dsc2-deficient cells
  have not been directly investigated in this study. (B) Akt/β-catenin signaling.
  Akt is recruited to PIP3-rich regions of the plasma membrane via its pleckstrin
  homology domain, where it is activated by phosphorylation at residues Ser-473 and
  Thr-308. Active Akt has been shown to enhance β-catenin signaling either by phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β at Ser-9 or by directly phosphorylating β-catenin at Ser-552. Note that
  GSK-3 is also part of the β-catenin destruction complex of the Wnt pathway. (C)
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, β-catenin is bound by the
  destruction complex and targeted for degradation (not depicted). In the presence
  of Wnt ligands, Wnt binds to the Frizzled (Fz) and LRP coreceptors, leading to the
  dissociation of the GSK-3–containing destruction complex from β-catenin and thereby
  promoting accumulation of β-catenin. Abbreviations: CK, casein kinase; Dvl, Dishevelled;
  EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Fz, Frizzled; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase
  3; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor–related protein.'
