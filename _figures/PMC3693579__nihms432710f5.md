caption: Schematic of signal transduction in MMTV-Pax8PPARγ mice. Pax8PPARγ is envisioned
  to act in a dominant-negative fashion to block PPARγ-dependent inactivation of ER
  through the proteasomal pathway, promote PGC-1 coactivation of ER, and block PPARγ-mediated
  transactivation of PTEN. Reduced PTEN activates PI3K and Ras/ERK and AKT, which
  Inhibit GSK3β and activate β-catenin/TCF signaling. ERK may stimulate ER transcription
  through AP-1 downstream of ERK. Although, ERK is known to phosphorylate and stabilize
  ER, pSer104/106ER levels were not altered in the mammary gland of MMTV-Pax8PPARγ
  vs. wild-type mice. ER may also be phosphorylated by AKT and GSK3β (thin lines),
  but this has not been examined. Activation of ER and PI3K signaling are believed
  to increase stem and progenitor cell expansion and ER+ tumors following progestin/DMBA
  carcinogenesis. It is controversial whether mammary stem cells are ER+.
