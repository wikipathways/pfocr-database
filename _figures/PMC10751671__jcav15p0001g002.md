caption: 'Schematic drawing of other melanoma hallmarks: resistance to cell death,
  evasion of immune destruction (due to blockade of anticancer immunity), and melanoma
  promoting inflammation (supporting tumor-sustaining pro-inflammatory cells) (upper
  part). Typically, cancer cells show defects in the apoptotic machinery, i.e., up-regulation
  of anti-apoptotic factors, like Bcl-2 or Bcl-Xl, and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic
  factors, like Bax or Bim. Moreover, the anticancer response mounted by the immune
  system is hampered, due to an increased activation of immune checkpoints (PD-L1/PD-1
  axis). Finally, the promotion of inflammatory response, with consequent excessive
  production of cytokines and growth/survival factors, further contributes to support
  melanoma evolution. The transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3, and the enzyme COX-2
  are key molecular players in the enrollment of pro-inflammatory cells by the tumor.
  Effects of physical activity on resistance to cell death, evasion of immune destruction,
  and melanoma promoting inflammation: by upregulating the canonical p53 pathway,
  physical activity has been reported to increase the pro-apoptotic signaling of ceramide
  in a melanoma murine model. Infiltration of the tumor by effector immune cells,
  like T, NK, and dendritic cells, and the increased proliferation of tumor non-infiltrated
  lymphocytes represent additional effects of physical activity, together with the
  decrease of serum levels of leptin (satiety hormone associated with pro-inflammatory,
  anti-apoptotic, and pro-angiogenic actions) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ,
  IL-2, and TNF-α). On the other hand, acute exercise may enhance IL-15 levels. Finally,
  in preclinical studies physical activity seemed to directly upregulate the expression
  of immune checkpoints (PD-1, PD-L1, and PD-L2) but did not synergize with PD-L1
  or PD-1 inhibitors. In the context of aquatic exercise, the amount of splenocytes
  from mice exercised in thermoneutral water (TT, 29°C) was significantly increased,
  compared to animals exercised in body temperature water (BT, 36°C), particularly
  involving CD8+ T and NK cells, with consequent enhanced release of IFNγ. Abbreviations.
