caption: One marker is not enough for designate one cell as cancer stem cell. Some
  markers are reported as representative of HCSCs (CD133, CD13, CD90, CD24, CD44,
  EpCAM, OV6 and activity of the ALDH family) nevertheless there are main signaling
  pathways dictating the stemness state. OV6 structure and function is still unknown.
  Properties or characteristics related of every HCSC marker are listed besides each
  marker (self-renew, chemoresistence, quiescence, tumorgenicity, etc). Gray lines
  with double arrows indicate correlation in expression (i.e. Notch and CD90, CD133
  and CD13 are overexpressed in the same CSCs population). Straight lines indicate
  that the molecule or pathway affects directly another molecule or pathway (i.e.
  CD44 affects directly TGF-β pathway, and TGF-β pathway affects directly AKT/GSK
  pathway). Doted line indicates that it affects indirectly the molecule or pathway
  (i.e., CD133 expression affects IL-8/CXCL1 via MAPK/ERK indirect activation).
