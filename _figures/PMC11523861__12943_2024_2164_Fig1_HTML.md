caption: 'Dietary Sources of Tryptophan and Main Pathways of Tryptophan Degradation
  (a) Tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is commonly acquired from dietary sources
  such as turkey, eggs, cheese, tofu, seeds, and fish. After ingestion, tryptophan
  is absorbed in the gut and enters the bloodstream for use in various metabolic processes.
  Besides protein synthesis, tryptophan undergoes three main catabolic pathways: the
  serotonin pathway, the kynurenine pathway, and the indole pathway. b In the kynurenine
  pathway, tryptophan is first converted into N-formyl-L-kynurenine by the enzymes
  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) or tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), which is
  then broken down into several metabolites, including kynurenine, leading to the
  production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). c In the serotonin pathway,
  tryptophan is converted into serotonin via the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH),
  followed by conversion to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and then to serotonin. Serotonin
  can further be converted into melatonin. d In the indole pathway, intestinal microbiota
  metabolizes tryptophan into various indole derivatives such as indole-3-acetic acid
  (IAA), indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and indole-3-aldehyde (IAld)'
