caption: 'Schematic representation of D3R and D1R interaction through some abnormalities
  in DAergic signaling caused by sensitized D1R signaling in the context of LID: D3R
  overexpression in the D1-enriched direct GABA pathway may contribute to the sensitization
  of D1Rs and the development of LID []. The enhancement of BDNF release (1) by chronic
  treatment with l-DOPA elicits the activation of TrκB (2) receptors and induces the
  overexpression of D3Rs. The levels of membrane-bound D1Rs increase through direct
  interaction with D3Rs (3). Thus, exacerbated D1R sensitization has been associated
  with dyskinetic behavior. D1R-induced increased levels of adenylyl cyclase (mostly
  the AC5 isoform) (4) through the stimulatory heterotrimeric Golf α subunit results
  in the production of cAMP, leading to hyperactivation of PKA (5) and DARPP-32 (6).
  Either pharmacological inhibition of PKA or genetic inactivation of DARPP-32 appears
  to reduce LID. Thus, abnormalities in PKA/DARPP-32 signaling seem to increase the
  phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor (7). The subsequent increase
  in striatonigral MSN excitability through D1 receptors may be involved in the loss
  of the expression of corticostriatal long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation
  (LTP) (8). The activation of ERK through sensitized D1R mediates transcriptional
  processes. The inhibition of ERK signaling was found to counterbalance the induction
  of LID. CREB phosphorylation, in response to PKA/DARPP-32 and ERK/MSK1 signaling,
  im-proves the expression of immediate early genes (ΔfosB) and prodynorphin (8).
  ERK activation may improve mTORC1 complex-dependent signaling, thereby initiating
  mRNA translation and protein synthesis (8). mTOR-mammalian target of rapamycin;
