caption: 'Iron homeostasis in absorptive enterocytes, macrophages, erythroblasts,
  and hepatocytes and its routes of circulation in the organism. Non-heme iron absorption
  occurs in intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) in the duodenum. The first step
  in the transport of iron across the apical membrane of enterocytes is ferric (Fe3+)
  to ferrous (Fe2+) iron reduction, catalyzed by the membrane-associated ferrireductase
  DcytB. Ferrous iron is subsequently transported into the enterocyte via the divalent
  metal transporter 1 (DMT1)-dependent pathway. Heme, another source of dietary iron,
  is also taken up by enterocytes, although its receptor/transporter has not been
  fully characterized. A proton-coupled folate transporter/heme carrier protein 1
  (PCFT/HCP1) has been proposed as being primarily responsible for heme uptake, but
  recent data show that it mainly serves as a folate transporter and has a lower affinity
  for heme. After uptake, heme is catabolized by inducible heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)—to
  iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide. The released iron is subsequently used for
  cellular needs (e.g., for iron–sulfur cluster biogenesis in mitochondria), stored
  inside the cell in ferritin (which probably requires the chaperone PCBP1 (poly (rC)
  binding protein 1) to delivers iron to Ft), or exported into the circulation by
  the iron exporter ferroportin (Fpn). Iron export from enterocytes also requires
  hephaestin (Heph), a multicopper oxidase, which oxidizes Fe2+ to Fe3+, prior to
  iron binding by transferrin in the blood (Tf). Iron bound to transferrin is taken
  up by most cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. There are two known transferrin
  receptors (TfRs): TfR1, which is present in all cell types, and TfR2 mostly expressed
  in hepatocytes. To prevent heme toxicity and cell death, hematopoietic and most
  non-hematopoietic cells express feline leukemia virus subgroup C cellular receptor
  (FLVCR1), which mediates heme export. This is of particular importance in the removal
  of heme from erythroid progenitor cells that have a high iron requirement (e.g.,
  by increased TfR1 expression) for hemoglobin (Hb) production. Heme present in the
  blood circulation is cleared by hemopexin (Hp). The heme–hemopexin complex is taken
  up by hepatocytes and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system via CD91-mediated
  endocytosis. Since there is no natural pathway to excrete excess iron from the organism
  and iron uptake is limited, the recycling of iron from heme released from red blood
  cells after erythrophagocytosis is the main source of the element to fulfil daily
  requirements. Iron trafficking is controlled by the key iron regulatory hormone
  hepcidin. Its expression, which takes place mainly in hepatocytes, is precisely
  regulated and depends, e.g., on transferrin saturation. Hepcidin can bind to Fpn,
  causing its internalization and degradation, hence decreasing iron export from enterocytes
  and other cell types into the plasma'
