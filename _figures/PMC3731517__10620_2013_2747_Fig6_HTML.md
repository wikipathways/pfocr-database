caption: Hepatic cholesterol synthesis and catabolism enzymes, uptake receptors, BA
  transport systems, phase II detoxification enzymes, and nuclear receptors investigated
  in this study. HMG-CoA R is the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis.
  CYP7A1 represents the key enzyme for the catabolism of cholesterol to BA in the
  classic pathway, followed by CYP8B1. The alternative pathway is initially catalyzed
  by CYP27A1, followed by CYP7B1. LDLR and LRP1 contribute to controlling the serum
  cholesterol level by removing cholesterol-contained lipoproteins from the bloodstream.
  Canalicular BA export is largely mediated by BSEP. Alternative BA export is mediated
  via basolateral MRP3. The phase II conjugation is mediated by UGT1A1 and SULT2A1.
  Nuclear receptors such as LXRα, FXR, PXR and CAR coordinately regulate BA homeostasis.
  The changes in these markers in the liver of the HFC diet-induced fibrotic steatohepatitis
  rat model were indicated using arrows. Dotted black arrows denote expected suppression
  of cholesterol synthesis and uptake from blood after HFC-diet feeding. Solid black
  arrows denote abnormal alterations observed in this model. Dotted gray arrows denote
  presumptions from all these findings. BA bile acid, BA-SO 3 sulfated BA, Bili bilirubin,
