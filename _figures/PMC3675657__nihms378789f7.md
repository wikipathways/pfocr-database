caption: 'Mechanisms for iron-dependent and iron-independent IRP2 regulation. Iron-dependent
  degradation: when iron and oxygen are high, the FBXL5 hemerythrin-domain binds iron
  and leads to a conformational change that increases FBXL5 stability. FBXL5 binds
  to IRP2 and FBXL5-IRP2 associates with SKP1–CUL1 complex, catalyzing the ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation of IRP2. When iron or oxygen is limited, FBXL5 is destabilized
  and targeted for degradation by an unidentified E3 ligase. IRP2 iron-independent
  pathway: IRP2 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1(CDK1/cyclinB1) during
  G2/M and dephosphorylated by CDC14A at the end of mitosis. S157 phosphorylation
  is independent of iron and is associated with reduced RNA binding activity. Non-phosphorylated
  and phosphorylated IRP2 are subjected to FBXL5 iron-mediated degradation.Modified
