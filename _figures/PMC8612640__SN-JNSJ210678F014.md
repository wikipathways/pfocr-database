caption: A conceptual model of latent incision-induced chronic pronociceptive signaling
  that is kept in remission by tonic endogenous KOR activity in the dorsal horn. KOR
  is an inhibitory GPCR and as such inhibits the activity of the AC. AC1 is a Ca2+-activated
  protein, which converts the ATP to cAMP and acts as a key modulator for the induction
  of pathologic pain. It couples the intracellular Ca2+ derived from NMDAR activation
  to downstream activation of an array of downstream proteins and kinases. AC1–cAMP
  signaling activates multiple downstream signal molecules including the canonical
  PKA as well as the Epac protein family. In male mice (left), incision induces both
  NMDAR→AC1→PKA and NMDAR→AC1→Epac signaling pathways, leading to changes in gene
  transcription through undetermined transcription factors (?) and ultimately long-term
  changes in spinal neuron hyperexcitability, hyperalgesia, and affective pain. By
  contrast, in female mice (right), KOR inhibition operates through just the NMDAR→AC1→Epac
  signaling pathway.
