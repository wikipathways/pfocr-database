caption: Due to uncontrolled cell proliferation, cancer cells often encounter excess
  mis-/un-folded protein aggregates, which are subsequently labeled with either K48-linked
  or K63-linked polyubiquitination for proteolytic degradation. While K48-linked ubiquitin
  chains are targeted for the proteasomal pathway, K63-linked directs autophagy mediated
  protein degradation. Upon proteasomal inhibition, EBV oncoprotein EBNA3C is predominantly
  tagged with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, translocated to cytoplasm by an unknown
  mechanism and degraded through autophagy-lysosomal pathway. The N-terminal domain
  plays a central role in EBNA3C’s degradation through autophagy mechanism by participating
  within the p62-LC3B complex. Suppression of autophagy pathway (Beclin1 and p62 knockdown
  or chloroquine (CQ)/bafilomycin treatment) reverses EBNA3C degradation in response
  to proteasomal inhibition. Additionally, proteasomal inhibitors (such as MG132)
  induce both autophagy and viral gene transcription that eventually activate viral
  lytic replication. The results provide foundation to exploit proteasome inhibitors
  as potential therapeutic approach for EBV associated B-cell lymphomas, where EBNA3C
  is expressed, typically diagnosed in immunocompromised individuals.

    directs autophagy mediated protein degradation. Upon proteasomal inhibition, EBV
    oncoprotein EBNA3C is predominantly tagged with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains,
