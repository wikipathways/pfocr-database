caption: (A) Partial network of Wnt signaling; red squares designate mRNAs upregulated
  by at least 1.5-fold in response to L-WRN+. (B) Proliferative signaling network
  focused on Ki-67 and Sp1. (C) Partial network of TGF-β signaling. Up and downregulated
  mRNAs in panels A–C were defined using RNA-sequencing; red squares designate mRNAs
  upregulated by at least 1.5-fold in respone to L-WRN+; blue squares designate downregulated
  mRNAs. Green connecting lines indicate activation, red connecting lines indicate
  inhibition, and gray lines indicate mixed or uncertain effects, according to previously
  published studies contained in the curated MetaCore database. (D & E) Wnt pathway
  targets Axin2 and c-Myc compared amongst treated islets using qRT-PCR. Islets (75)
  were cultured for indicated times in CMRL-1066 medium containing 10% FBS and 5 mM
  glucose ± 5 mM LiCl or in 50% Wnt3a, R-spondin-3 and Noggin conditioned medium (L-WRN)
  ± Y-27632 and SB-431542 inhibitors as indicated. Samples were processed for qRT-PCR
  and levels of mRNA for Axin2 and c-Myc were determined as described in . Transcripts
  were normalized to β-actin at the corresponding time point. Data are the means ±
  SE of n = 3 biological replicates. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 denote significant
  differences between the treatment condition and the control.
