caption: (A) Proposed catalytic cycle. Observed first order dependence on 1-Cbz and
  Nuc indicate that nucleophilic addition is the rate-determining step. (B) Concerted
  SN2 and stepwise SN1 mechanisms require different mechanisms for enantioinduction.
  (C) Computational evaluation of the uncatalyzed reaction predicts that the SN1 pathway
  is much higher in energy than the SN2 pathway. All DFT calculations were performed
  at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory including solvent corrections PCM(DCM).
  For a fuller discussion of the computational study, see .
