  for the T315I mutation in BCR–ABL in chronic myeloid leukaemia. treatment with a
  kinase inhibitor can induce upregulation of a second kinase that substitutes for

  hepatocyte growth factor receptor) has been shown to be overexpressed in lung cancer
  cells that acquire resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.
  Tumour cells can respond to treatment with a kinase inhibitor by down-regulating
  the phosphatase that normally dephosphorylates the substrates of that kinase (right
