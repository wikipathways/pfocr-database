caption: Diagram of the Notch3 signaling pathway in ovarian CSC. (a) In Notch3-overexpressing
  ovarian CSC, Notch signaling is triggered by ligand binding to Notch3 receptor,
  which undergoes a two-step proteolytic cleavage by ADAM family proteases and γ-secretases,
  respectively. Subsequently, the Notch3 intracellular domain (NICD3) is released
  and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to CSL and converts the transcriptional
  complex from a repressor to an activator of Notch3 target genes, known to be implicated
  in CSC maintenance, drug resistance and tumor recurrence. (b) Notch3 signaling inhibition
  by γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) or monoclonal antibodies against Notch3 blocks
  Notch3 target gene activation, resulting in the reduction of CSCs, increased chemosensitivity
  and tumor regression.
