caption: Activation pathways of histamine and PAF with involvement of their respective
  endothelial receptors are shown-leading to capillary permeability changes via vascular
  endothelial-cadherin (VE cadherin) and adherens junction (AJ) disruption. This culminates
  in fluid leak from postcapillary venules (PCV) contributing to hypovolemic/distributive
  shock. The elaboration of other mediators can also contribute to bronchospasm, angioedema
  and respiratory distress leading to asphyxia/hypoxemia and respiratory arrest. Involvement
  of RhoA and ROCK signaling in VE-cadherin relocalization as well as the PI3kinase-Akt
  pathway of eNOS activation are shown in cartoon format (adapted from Nakamura and
  Muraata, 2018) [].
