caption: 'In carcinogen-associated HNSCC, chronic exposure to reactive oxygen species
  and repeated DNA damage lead to NF-κB activation. Activation can also occur via
  aberrant signaling through cytokine and growth factor receptors, such as TNFR, TLR,
  and EGFR, or activation by intermediate kinases, such as IKKs, PI3K/Akt, and MAPKs.
  In the pathogen-associated subset of HNSCC, the HPV E6 protein induces degradation
  of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and activates NF-κB via interactions with proteins
  containing PDZ domains. The EBV LMP1 protein activates the canonical NF-κB pathway
  by TRAF6-mediated IκBα phosphorylation and the alternative pathway by inducing processing
  of p100 to p52. Activation of the canonical pathway by TNF family members or other
  cytokine receptors, such as TLR, causes phosphorylation of IκB by an IKKα/IKKβ/IKKγ
  complex, leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of IκB. p105 is processed
  to p50, and p50/RelA or p50/cRel heterodimers translocate to the nucleus and bind
  to promoters to regulate gene expression. The alternative pathway is activated by
  CD40L, BAFF, and LTβ, and involves signaling through TRAF3/6 complex and NIK to
  IKKα/IKKα homodimers, which activate processing of p100 into p52. Subsequently,
  p52/RelB heterodimers translocate to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor.
  Both pathways cooperatively regulate a variety of processes such as proliferation,
  apoptosis, migration, inflammation, and angiogenesis. Abbreviations: EGFR= epidermal
