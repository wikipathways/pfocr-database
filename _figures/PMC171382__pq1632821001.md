caption: (A) The de novo hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, salvage  pathway, and dynamic
  glycosylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins.  O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are biosynthesized
  in a series of  enzymatic steps. The first committed step in the de novo process
  is  the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to glucosamine-6-phosphate through the  action
  of the enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT).  Glucosamine-6-phosphate
  is then converted to the common intermediate  N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (3a)
  through the action of  acetyl-CoA:d-glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase  (GAT).
  The salvage pathway bypasses the de novo pathway through the  action of GlcNAc kinase
  (GNK) and also generates GlcNAc-6-phosphate  (3a). This intermediate is converted
  to GlcNAc-1-phosphate (4a)  through the action of AGM1. N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
  is  converted to the end product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway,  UDP-GlcNAc
  (5a), through the action of UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase  (AGX1). OGTase transfers
  the saccharide moiety of UDP-GlcNAc to protein  substrates within the cell. Hexosaminidase
  C (O-GlcNAcase) acts to  cleave the glycosidic linkage of posttranslationally modified
  proteins to  liberate the protein and GlcNAc (2a). Exogenously added  Ac4GlcNAz
  (1b) diffuses into the cell and is deacylated  through the action of intracellular
  esterases, and then enters into the  salvage pathway. (B) Chromogenic substrates
  for O-GlcNAcase.  Shown are para-nitrophenyl  2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside
  (6) and  para-nitrophenyl  2-azidoacetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranoside (7).
