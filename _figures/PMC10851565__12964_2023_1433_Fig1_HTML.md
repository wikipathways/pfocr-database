caption: 'The canonical and non-canonical pathways of the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  This signaling pathway comprises three distinct routes: the canonical, non-canonical
  pathways and atypical pathway. In the canonical pathway, Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
  tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs), and interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) are
  activated, leading to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the inhibitory
  protein IκB. As a result, NF-κB is liberated from the complex with IκB and translocates
  to the nucleus. Conversely, the non-canonical pathway relies on the activation of
  the NF-κB2 (p100)/RelB complex by specific receptors such as B-cell activating factor
  receptor (BAFFR), CD40, and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK). This
  activation triggers a cascade of events, including the phosphorylation of NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK), which in turn phosphorylates IKKα. Consequently, the p52-RelB heterodimer
  is activated and translocates to the nucleus. The activation of NF-κB signaling
  pathway exerts regulatory effects on various cellular processes by controlling the
  expression of cytokines, chemokines, and other genes. Several “atypical” pathways
  have been described, including radiation-induced NF-κB activation. NF-κB activation
  follows an atypical pathway, involving distinct phosphorylation events such as Tyr42
  phosphorylation by Syk or Src family kinases, triggered by various stimuli. This
  leads to IκBα dissociation from the RelA/p50 dimer without proteasomal degradation.
  In the PEST domain, CKII phosphorylates IκBα at Ser293, promoting calpain-mediated
  degradation'
