caption: Canonical Type I IFN signaling activated by DNA virus and RNA virus. Upon
  recognized viral RNA, RIG-I is activated by TRIM25- and RNF135-mediated K63 ubiquitination
  and translocated to mitochondrial at which activates MAVS. Activated MAVS undergoes
  self-polymerized then recruits a group of ubiquitin ligase TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6
  to activate downstream kinases TBK1 and IKK. TBK1 activation induced the expression
  of type I IFN by activating transcriptional factor IRF3, whereas IKK complex activation
  induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by activating NF-κB. TLR3 recognizes
  dsRNA and triggers IRF3 and NF-κB signaling through the adaptor protein TRIF; Upon
  DNA virus infection, cGAS recognizes viral DNA then synthesizes cGAMP from ATP and
  GTP. cGAMP induces the activation and trafficking of STING to the sites at which
  recruits TBK1 and activates it to induce the production of type I IFNs by activating
  IRF3. TLR9 mainly recognizes unmethylated CpG DNA and activates NF-κB through the
  adaptors MyD88 and TIRAP. Activated TLR9 also initiates an alternative MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway that activates the transcription factor IRF7 to induce the expression
  of type I IFNs in DCs (not depicted). The secreted IFNα and IFNβ bind to the interferon-α
  receptor IFNAR that composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits. The adaptor kinase JAK1
  and TYK2 are activated by this binding and then recruit STAT complex as indicated.
  The ISGF3 complex is composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, which binds to the ISRE
  elements to activate ISGs. By contrast, the STAT1 homodimers bind to GASs elements
  to induce the production of inflammatory mediators. Type I IFNs also activates STAT3
  homodimers, which represent a repressor of inflammatory pathways (not depicted).

    Upon recognized viral RNA, RIG-I is activated by TRIM25- and RNF135-mediated K63

    MAVS undergoes self-polymerized then recruits a group of ubiquitin ligase TRAF2,
