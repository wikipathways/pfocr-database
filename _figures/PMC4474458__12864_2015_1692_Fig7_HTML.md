caption: Summary of B. pseudomallei genes that contribute to biofilm development.
  a In response to varied environmental signals, B. pseudomallei regulates the two-component
  signal (TCS) transduction system to adapt to environmental changes, by (b) transcribing
  genes that encode proteins involved in the alteration of surface components and
  components crucial to initiate attachment of planktonic bacterial cells to solid
  surfaces for microcolony formation. As the biofilm grows, an oxygen-limited environment
  forms. c The high biofilm producing B. pseudomallei strain utilises nitrate for
  anaerobic growth through the denitrification enzyme pathway. Arrow represents activator
  connection; solid lines represent direct activation; dashed lines represent indirect
  activation. The boxes and fonts highlighted in red depict the up-regulated biological
  processes and genes, respectively, while the box highlighted in green depicts the
  down-regulated biological processes
