caption: M. catarrhalis immune evasion strategies mediated by the UspA OMPs. (A) Inhibition
  of the complement system. Both UspA1 and UspA2 fulfill an important role in serum
  resistance, with a more dominant role for UspA2. The UspA2 protein binds the complement
  inhibitor C4bp, enabling M. catarrhalis to inhibit the classical complement system.
  UspA2 also prevents activation of the alternative complement pathway by absorbing
  C3 from serum. Further, UspA2 interferes with the terminal stages of the complement
  system, the MAC, by binding the complement regulator protein vitronectin. (B) Inhibition
  of the TLR2-NF-κB proinflammatory response. The UspA1 protein targets the CEACAM1
  molecules on host epithelial cells. M. catarrhalis uses UspA1-mediated CEACAM1 binding
  to counteract the TLR2-initiated proinflammatory response. M. catarrhalis PAMP-mediated
  activation of TLR2 results in the recruitment of the p85α regulatory subunit of
  PI3K and finally the transcription of proinflammatory genes, which are regulated
  by NF-κB. Binding of UspA1 to CEACAM1 results in increased phosphorylation of tyrosine
  residues of the cytoplasmic ITIM domain of CEACAM1 and subsequently to the recruitment
  of SHP-1. SHP-1 inhibits the phosphorylation of p85α, thus blocking the activation
  of a proinflammatory response by inhibiting the activation of the PI3K-Akt-NF-κB
  pathway. Further details may be found in the text. GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor.

    (A) Inhibition of the complement system. Both UspA1 and UspA2 fulfill an important
    role in serum resistance, with a more dominant role for UspA2. The UspA2 protein
    binds the complement inhibitor C4bp, enabling M. catarrhalis to inhibit the classical

    protein vitronectin. (B) Inhibition of the TLR2-NF-κB proinflammatory response.
    The UspA1 protein targets the CEACAM1 molecules on host epithelial cells. M. catarrhalis
    uses UspA1-mediated CEACAM1 binding to counteract the TLR2-initiated proinflammatory
    response. M. catarrhalis PAMP-mediated activation of TLR2 results in the recruitment
