caption: PERK activates apoptotic cascades in multiple ways. Apoptosis is ultimately
  induced by sustained PERK activation after E2 therapy in endocrine-resistant breast
  cancer cells. The classical way that PERK induces apoptosis is by activating ATF4
  and the downstream pro-apoptotic protein CHOP. Additionally, PERK regulates the
  function of the mitochondria and results in the release of ROS and overexpression
  of BH3-only proteins. Finally, the extrinsic apoptotic pathway is activated by PERK
  that is mediated by STAT3 to increase the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB and subsequently
  induce TNFα expression. Figure republished with permission from AACR ().
