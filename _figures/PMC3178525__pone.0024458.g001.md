caption: '(A) The pathway is classified into three groups based on the enzymatic activity
  and subcellular localization. Plastidial terpene cyclases convert the precursor
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) into ent-copalyl diphosphate (CDP), and subsequently
  into ent-kaurene, in a two-step process catalyzed by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase
  (CPS) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS). Cytochrome P-450 mono-oxygenases such as ent-kaurene
  oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) yield GA12. Cytoplasmic dioxygenases
  are responsible for the latest steps and conversion to bioactive gibberellins and
  their inactive catabolites. GA12 in potato is early 13-hydroxylated by GA 13-oxidase
  (GA13ox). As indicated by curved dotted T-lines or arrows emerging from the bioactive
  GA1, GA20ox and GA3ox corresponding transcripts are under negative feed-back regulation,
  whereas GA2ox mRNA is under positive feed-forward regulation by GA1. (B) Neighbor-joining
  tree obtained with the alignment of the amino acid sequences: St3ox1 and St3ox2
  correspond to potato StGA3ox1 (FJ792644) and StGA3ox2 (FJ792643); At3ox1 and At3ox2
  to arabidopsis AtGA3ox1 (NM101424) and AtGA3ox2 (NM106683); Ps3ox1 to pea PsGA3ox1
  (AF010167), Ls3h1 and Ls3h2 to lettuce LsGA3ox1 (AB012205) and LsGA3ox2 (AB012206);
  Le3ox1 and Le3ox2 to tomato SlGA3ox1 (AB010991) and SlGA3ox2 (AB010992), tobacco
  Nty is NtGA3ox1 (AB032198), and Os3ox1 and Os3ox2 are rice genes OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2
  (AB054084 and AB056519).'
