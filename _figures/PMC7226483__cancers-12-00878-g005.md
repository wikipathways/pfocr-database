caption: The DNA damage response, highlighting cross-talk between the cell cycle and
  DNA repair. (a) Base excision repair (BER) is the first line of defence when DNA
  damage occurs. PARP activation by SSB recruits XRCC1, Pol β, and Lig III to repair
  the DNA. (b) When PARP is inhibited, SSB accumulate, causing stalled replication
  forks, and single-ended DSBs, causing fork collapse. BRCA2 facilitates replacing
  RPA with repair protein RAD51, which subsequently forms a filament to search for
  the specific homologous sequence on the sister chromatid as a template for repair
  and re-start. PARPi-induced replication stress activates ATR, which initiates a
  signalling cascade. ATR activates CHK1 by phosphorylation at serine 345, causing
  CHK1 to autophosphorylate at serine 296, to achieve full activation. CHK1 inactivates
  CDC25A/C, thereby preventing the removal of inhibitory phosphorylation on CDK2 and
  1, respectively, thus preventing S-phase progression and mitosis. The pathway also
  promotes HRR as CHK1 activates BRCA2 and RAD51 by phosphorylation, and ATR also
  phosphorylates RAD51.
