caption: Schematic illustration of VEGFR structures and their specific ligands. VEGFRs
  are depicted as ligand-bound activated dimers. The VEGF-ligand family includes VEGFA,
  VEGFB, VEGFC, VEGFD, and the placenta growth factor (PlGF), which binds VEGFRs in
  a specific manner. VEGFB binds selectively to VEGFR-1. In contrast, VEGFA can activate
  VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-1, while VEGFC and VEGFD could anchor both VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 pathways.
  The VEGFRs co-receptors are indicated as NRP-1 and NRP-2 (neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2,
  respectively) and HS (heparan sulfate; the main biological functions are listed
  below the respective receptors. In general, the VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 pathway plays
  a fatal role in the lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in bladder cancer,
  though VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-2 pathway may participate to some extent.
