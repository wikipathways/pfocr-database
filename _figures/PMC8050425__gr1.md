caption: 'Overview of endocytosis and main trafficking pathways in budding yeast and
  filamentous fungi. (A) Clathrin-mediated endocytosis and main trafficking pathways
  of plasma membrane proteins in budding yeast (adapted from , , , , , , , , ). Environmental
  changes, stress or specific compounds (endocytic signals) can trigger PM nutrient
  transporter endocytosis, a process normally preceded by PM transporter ubiquitylation,
  mediated by Rsp5-ART complexes, and dependent on clathrin and on the AP2 complex.
  According to the Day et al. recent model , cargo proteins internalized into endocytic
  vesicles are sorted to the TGN (which is proposed to also serve as an early and
  recycling endosome). They are then delivered to the PVE/MVB, where cargo can i)
  be recycled back to the PM (endosome-to-PM recycling pathway); ii) be directed to
  the endosome-to-Golgi retrograde trafficking pathway and be secreted and recycled
  back to the PM, via the secretory pathway; iii) be targeted for vacuolar degradation
  by the vacuolar/MVB degradative pathway. It is still unclear if some endocytic vesicles
  can be targeted directly from the PM to the PVE/MVB.Newly-synthetized PM transporters
  at the ER are thought to be targeted from the Golgi and can then be sorted either
  to: i) the PM via the secretory pathway, or ii) to the vacuole indirectly, via vacuolar
  protein sorting pathway or iii) directly to the vacuole via alkaline phosphatase
  pathway. The latter pathway is not explored in the context of this review, so it
  will not be further detailed. (B)Endocytosis and main trafficking pathways of plasma
  membrane transporters and polar proteins in Aspergillus nidulans (adapted from ,
  , ). In A. nidulans , there are two distinct endocytic pathways. The pathway required
  for the internalization of PM transporters involves their ubiquitylation by HulARsp5
  -Art complexes, and depends on clathrin but not on AP2. All internalized transporters
  studied, so far, are degraded in the vacuole via the MVB degradative pathway. The
  other endocytic route, essential for polar growth, is for apical PM proteins that
  diffuse laterally to the sub-apical/endocytic collar (enriched in actin patches),
  where they are internalized by a clathrin-independent, but AP2-dependent process.
  Internalized vesicles are targeted to sorting endosomes (SE), then to the late Golgi/TGN,
  via endosome-to-Golgi retrograde pathway. From this point, AP1/clathrin coated-vesicles
  transport polar cargo to the so-called Spitzenkörper (SPK), from which polar proteins
  fuse to the PM. Additionally, two different secretory pathways were also described
  , . While polar proteins follow the conventional Golgi-to-TGN dependent secretory
  pathway, newly synthetized transporter proteins traffic from the ER to the PM by
  an alternative pathway, without passing through the Golgi. ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  MVB, multi vesicular bodies; PVE, pre-vacuolar endosome; PM, plasma membrane; TGN,
  trans-Golgi network; SE, sorting endosomes; SPK, Spitzenkörper; signals (+) and
  (-) represent activation and inhibition, respectively.'
