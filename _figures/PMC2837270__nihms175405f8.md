caption: The rat NF-κB signaling pathway RT2 Profiler PCR Array was used to examine
  the expression of 84 pathway-focused genes and the resulting gene expression values
  were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and only genes that demonstrated a > 2-fold change
  with P < 0.05 in the contrast comparison of expression values from experimental
  treatment cells and mock infected cells were considered differentially expressed.
  Represented in the custom pathway is the fold change in the expression of genes
  from BMDMs infected with SEOV and subsequently stimulated with LPS relative to either
  mock-treated or LPS-treated cells. The contrast comparisons were imported into IPA
  and clustered into functional groups based on biological function to create a network
  of genes that are associated with NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses and that
  are differentially expressed following SEOV infection. Gray lines indicate direct
  relationships between genes. See  for the complete list of genes and fold change
  values.
