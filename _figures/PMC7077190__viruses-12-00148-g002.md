caption: A conserved mechanism used by insect-borne plant viruses to interrupt the
  JAZ-MYC hub. Viral effectors attenuate the JAZ-MYC hub to interfere with plant defenses
  against insect vectors, thus manipulating the vector’s feeding behavior to promote
  viral spread. The 2b protein of the Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) directly interacts
  with JAZ proteins and protects JAZs from degradation, thereby attenuating the JA
  signaling pathway to be activated. The C2 protein from the Tomato yellow leaf curl
  virus (TYLCV) interacts with plant ubiquitin RPS27A to suppress JAZ1 degradation
  and activation of the JA pathway. The viral genetic factor βC1 of the Tomato yellow
  leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) disrupts the transcriptional activity of MYC2, thus
  compromising activation of the MYC2-regulated chemical defense against insects.
  The nonstructural proteins (NSs) of orthotospoviruses manipulate JA-mediate defenses
  through direct interaction with MYC2. These dysfunctions of JAZ-MYC hub lead to
  enhanced insect vectors performance on plants.
