caption: NF-κB signaling pathway in cancer stem cells NF-κB proteins are involved
  in the dimerization of transcription factors, regulate gene expression, and affect
  various CSC biological processes, including inflammation, stress responses, growth,
  and development of CSCs. The main physiological function of NF-κB is the p50-p65
  dimer. The active p50-p65 dimer is further activated by post-translational modification
  (phosphorylation, acetylation, or glycosylation) and transported into the nucleus,
  which induces the expression of target genes in combination with other transcription
  factors. Some proteins (CD44, CD146, TNFRSF19, Bmi-1, FOXP3, and SDF-1) and microRNAs
  (miR-221 and miR-222) directly regulate the NF-κB pathway. In addition, some proteins
  (PGE2, GIT-1 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1), C-C chemokine
  receptor 7 (CCR7), and TGF-β) and miR-491 indirectly affect the NF-κB pathway via
  the ERK and MAPK pathways in CSCs
