caption: Model for a Dlg5-mediated bifurcation in Smo activity during Hh response.
  In the absence of Hh, Gpr161 establishes a level of cAMP in the cilium that promotes
  the Kif7 and PKA/CK1α-dependent processing of Gli3 into Gli3R at the basal body.
  Upon Hh stimulation, in the “Dlg5-independent” arm of the pathway, Smo activation
  in the cilium drives the ciliary exit of Gpr161, and the consequent decrease of
  ciliary cAMP leads to suppression of Gli3R formation, thus alleviating transcriptional
  repression of Gli1 and other transcriptional targets. In the “Dlg5-dependent” arm
  of the pathway, Dlg5 interaction with Smo at the basal body contributes to the formation
  of a complex that results in accumulation of Gli2 and Kif7 in the cilium and to
  the activation of Gli2 and subsequent high-level Hh response.
