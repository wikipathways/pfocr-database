caption: BHBA-induced activation of intracellular signaling and chromatin remodeling
  in Bdnf promoters in hippocampal neurons. BHBA induces increase of transcriptional
  mark H3K4me3 as well as decrease of transcriptional mark H2AK119ub occupied in bdnf
  promoters in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, BHBA-induced changes of H2AK119ub is
  dependent on the activation of L-type calcium channel and the elevation of intracellular,
  which subsequently activates Ca2+/CaMKII/p-CREB signaling pathway, and promotes
  the occupation of p-CREB and CBP in bdnf promoters, thereby enhances BDNF expression.
  However, BHBA-increased H3K4me3 is dependent on cAMP/PKA activation.
