caption: Schematic representation of the Wingless and Int-1 (WNT)/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. In the non-active state (left panel), β-catenin is phosphorylated by a
  multi-component complex containing glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), Axin, adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC), and casein kinase-1 (CK-1). This causes β-catenin to be phosphorylated
  for degradation by the proteasome complex. In the active state (right panel), a
  WNT ligand binds to its receptor and co-receptor, Frizzled (Fzd), and low density
  lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (LRP5/6), respectively, and causes
  the recruitment of components of the β-catenin phosphorylating complex to the membrane
  together with disheveled (DSH). This leads to the cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin
  and its translocation to the nucleus, eventually binding members of the T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancing factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors and activating transcription of
  target genes.
