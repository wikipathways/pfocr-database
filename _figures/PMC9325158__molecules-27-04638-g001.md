caption: 'The cGAS-STING pathway. The cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS interacts with exogenous
  DNA from dying cells, virus, and bacteria, which promotes a conformational change
  in cGAS to catalyze the formation of cGAMP. The cGAS activation and cGAMP synthase
  activate protein STING. TBK1 and STING co-phosphate IRF3. Dimerized IRF3 imports
  to the nucleus to target corresponding genes. IRF3 regulates the expression of IFNB1
  in the nucleus. IFNB1 translation in the cytoplasm results in the production of
  type I IFN, secreting out of cells. Type I IFN stimulates tyrosine kinase-associated
  receptor and IFNAR1/IFNAR2 heterodimers, which phosphorylates STAT1/STAT2. IRF9
  together with phosphorylated dimer STAT/STAT, as a transcriptional factor, transactivates
  cGAS, developing the positive feedback of cGAS-STING signals. Similarly, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 14 and IKK are recruited by activated STING. NIK phosphorylates nuclear
  factor kappa B subunit 2 (NFKB2/p100) combined with RELB. After degradation of phosphorylated
  p100 to p52, p52 and REBL form a heterodimer to elicit non-canonical NF-κB signals.
  For the canonical NF-κB signals, kinase IKK phosphorylates NF-κB inhibitor alpha
  to recognize proteasomal degradation. Thus, the heterodimer p65/p50 is separated
  from the IκB/p65/p50 complex to the nucleus, eliciting canonical NF-κB signals.
  Activation of the cGAS-STING signal pathway induces a series of immune cascades
  to produce diverse products, including type I IFN, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines.
  In an autocrine way, it could promote the maturation, activation, and polarization
  of macrophages. In a paracrine way, the different cytokines produced by APCs could
  recruit T lymphocytes and promote their proliferation and differentiation. All the
  above immune responses participate in the pathogenesis and progression of various
  diseases. Abbreviations: cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; cGAMP, 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP;
