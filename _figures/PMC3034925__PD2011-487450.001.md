caption: Simplified schematic representation of the link between LPS-induced microglial
  activation, inflammatory mediators, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Microglia
  respond to pathogens, proinflammatory cytokines, neuronal dysfunction, and cellular
  debris after injury or necrosis. These cells are at the forefront of the defence
  mechanisms that could set the conditions for repair or contribute to neuronal damage.
  Such equilibrium might depend on the expression and function of specific TLRs and
  how they are activated by endogenous and exogenous ligands and signals. Recognition
  of such signals lead to transcriptional activation of innate immune genes. Bacterial
  endotoxin LPS is a potent stimulator of macrophages, monocytes, microglia, and astrocytes
  causing release of various immunoregulatory and proinflammatory cytokines and free
  radicals. Neurons do not express functional TLR-4. Thus, LPS does not appear to
  have a direct effect on neurons, making it an ideal activator to study indirect
  neuronal injury mediated by microglial activation []. LPS binds to its intermediate
  receptor CD14 and in concert with TLR4 and accessory adaptor protein MD2 triggers
  the activation of kinases of various intracellular signaling pathways. The MyD88-dependent
  cascade initiates NFκB activation through the IKKs and/or the MAPK pathway, leading
  to the upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β) and increased
  production of other inflammatory mediators (NO and PGE2, synthesized by iNOS and
  COX-2, resp.). These soluble mediators collectively damage nigral dopaminergic neuron.
  MMP-3 and αSYN released by stressed neurons aggravate microglial activation. Astrocyte,
  different activation states of microglia, peripheral immune cells, many molecules
  involved in intracellular signaling pathways, and crosstalk between TLR signaling
  pathway and NADPH oxidase enzyme system are not shown for the simplicity. Please
  see text for the abbreviations and the details of TLR signaling pathway.
