caption: Major mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between NGPs and host. This illustration
  contains 5 types of intestinal microbiota and their changes mentioned in this review.
  Each of these mechanisms may play a role in the onset and progression of many inflammatory
  diseases, although the precise mechanisms are not known. The mechanisms underlying
  the effects of certain microbiota on the gastrointestinal are described. Damage
  and inflammation at the intestinal barrier can result in a break in self-tolerance
  and potential for increased systemic inflammation. MAM inhibited the activation
  of NF-kappa B pathway, and Amuc 1100 derived from A. muciniphila metabolite are
  known to support intestinal barrier integrity, by increasing expression and organization
  of tight-junction proteins. Another important class of microbiota acting on DC cells
  by secreting substances such as PSA and butyrate. Then, DC cells further act on
  CD4+ T cells or regulatory T (Treg) cells to inhibit inflammation.
