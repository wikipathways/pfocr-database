caption: EGCG inhibits breast cancer stem cells by targeting developmental pathways.
  The natural compound epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) targets Shh signaling by suppressing
  GLI1 expression and GLI1 activity, Notch pathway by inhibiting Notch 1 transcription,
  NF-kB pathway by inhibiting its activity and Wnt signaling by downregulating β-catenin.
