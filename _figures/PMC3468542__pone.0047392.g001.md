caption: De novo biosynthesis of methionine requires homocysteine derived from cysteine
  – via cystathionine – and involves cystathionine beta-lyase (MoStr3). Homocysteine
  might also result from O-acetyl-L-homoserine. O-acetyl-L-homoserine is derived from
  aspartate in a pathway involving a number of enzymatic steps that have been omitted
  for clarity . This scheme is based on the predicted methionine and cysteine metabolic
  pathway map for M. oryzae at the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
