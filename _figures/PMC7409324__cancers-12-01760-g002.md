caption: NFkB-induced expression of MHC-I. Transcriptional activation of MHC-I heavy
  chain, but also other genes encoding for antigen processing machinery (APM) proteins,
  can be initiated by both the canonical (A) and non-canonical (B) NFkB pathway. IkB
  = inhibitors of kB; IKK = IkB kinase; NEMO = NF-kappa-B essential modulator; NIK
  = NFkB-inducing kinase; RIP-1 = receptor-interacting protein 1; TAK1 = TGF-β-activated
  kinase 1; TLR = toll-like receptor; TNFR = TNFα receptor; TRAF = TNF receptor-associated
  factor.
