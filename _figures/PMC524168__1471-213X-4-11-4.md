caption: Model for gene regulatory events under the control of TGFβ signaling. Transcriptional
  regulatory events suggested by expression data in this paper are indicated in red.
  The TGFβ pathway is shown in green; DAF-3 and DAF-5 form a transcription factor
  complex that function in neurons to control dauer entry [9]. DAF-3 and DAF-5 are
  shown regulating DAF-9 and DAF-12 indirectly because these genes are likely to be
  regulated in non-neuronal tissues. Insulin genes are shown as directly regulated
  by DAF-3 and DAF-5, but it is equally likely that these genes are regulated by feedback
  from the insulin pathway or by DAF-12.
