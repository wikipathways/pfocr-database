caption: S100A8/PhosphoA9 induces a pro-inflammatory response. Neutrophils stimulated
  by various stimuli (PMA, MSU, Aspergillus fumigates, or Aspergillus nidulans) release
  NETs via a pathway involving NADPH oxidase, PAD4, NE, and MPO. During NET formation,
  the phosphorylated S100A8/A9 heterodimer is released into the extracellular space.
  S100A8/PhosphoA9 can then activate neutrophils in the surrounding area, causing
  them to release cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and
  CXCL8). TLR4 signaling pathways are primarily responsible for this release, while
  additional receptors (such as RAGE) are involved in S100A8/PhosphoA9-mediated CCL2
  secretion. As a result, S100A8/PhosphoA9 produced by neutrophils is implicated in
  amplifying the inflammatory process, and may be a defining feature of inflammatory
  disorders. Here, MPO stands for myeloperoxidase; MSU stands for monosodium urate
  monohydrate; NE stands for neutrophil elastase; PAD4 stands for peptidyl arginine
  deiminase; PMA stands for phorbol 12-myristoyl 13-acetate; NET stands for a neutrophil
  extracellular trap; NADPH oxidase stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [].
