caption: Ca2+signaling pathways in β-cells. Following Ca2+ binding to Calmodulin (CaM),
  multiple downstream pathways are activated. CaM activates the Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) as well as members of the Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinases (CaMK). Ca2+/CaM-bound CaMKK can phosphorylate and activate CaMKIV
  (A). Ca2+-bound CaM also activates the phosphatase Calcineurin (CaN) (B), which
  removes phosphate groups from CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)
  and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) proteins, resulting in their nuclear
  localization. CRTC2 can be inactivated through phosphorylation by microtubule affinity
  regulating kinase 2 (MARK2) and salt inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) (C), and NFAT can
  be inactivated by the kinases GSK3B and DYRK1A (D). Ca2+ results in the activation
  of p44/p42 (ERK1/2) or the MAP kinase pathway through the stimulation of Ras-GRF
  by CaM and the dephosphorylation of Raf by CaN (E). The NF-κB pathway can also be
  activated by Ca2+ in β-cells through the phosphorylation of IκB, which releases
  the p50 and p65 subunits (F). The upstream activation of various CaMKs and members
  of the MAP kinase pathway result in the phosphorylation and activation of cAMP response
  element binding (CREB) (G).
