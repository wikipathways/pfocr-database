caption: Proposed schematic model of hormone interactions during bud dormancy induction
  and release in woody perennials. Solid arrows and lines indicate actions or interactions
  among hormones, pathways, and environmental cues that have been documented in the
  literature. Red color indicates the substance or process that induces dormancy,
  and green color indicates those that promote dormancy release. Both SD photoperiod
  and low temperature induce CBF, which directly promotes the expression of DAM genes.
  DAM proteins regulate dormancy through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways.
  In the former pathway, accumulation of DAMs reduces GA level, thus activating DELLA
  and subsequently XERICO proteins, which in turn promotes ABA synthesis. DAM genes
  can also upregulate ABA levels through upregulating the gene encoding NCED, a key
  enzyme in ABA synthesis. In addition to the control of DAMs over ABA biosynthesis
  and signaling, ABA can also negatively regulate the expression of DAM genes through
  SnRK2 and the ABA signaling component AREB. This pathway probably serves as a negative
  feedback regulation mechanism. In the ABA-independent regulation pathway, DAM proteins
  induce dormancy through negative regulation of FT, which in turn prevents CCG-mediated
  dormancy release. ABA can also repress CCG and inhibit the mitotic cell division.
  ABA was also found to suppress the intercellular communication during dormancy by
  enhancing the expression of callose synthase, leading to callose deposition and
  blockage of plasmodesmata. This alteration of plasmodesmata during dormancy is reversed
  by GA as buds transition to bud break. GAs induce the expression of glucanases which
  degrade callose, allowing for the passage of sugars and other growth-promoting factors.
  Under SD conditions, GA biosynthesis is inhibited through phytochrome and phytochrome-interacting
  factors. ET is induced by SD and has a negative impact on GA biosynthesis and signaling,
  which nominates it as a dormancy inducer. However, ET also inhibits ABA synthesis
  and signaling and negatively regulates CBF through activation of EIN3, which is
  also subject to the regulation of JA through JAZ proteins. JA induces bud dormancy
  by targeting JAZ proteins for degradation via the ubiquitination/26S proteasome,
  which in turn releases MYC2 and ICE1 from repression. Both MYC2 and ICE1 activate
  the expression of CBF. CK can repress ABA and promote dormancy release through inducing
  the expression of CCGs. IAA facilitates dormancy release through promoting GA biosynthesis
  and callose degradation. ABA, abscisic acid; CBF, C-repeat binding factor; CCG,
