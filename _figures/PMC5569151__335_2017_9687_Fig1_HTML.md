caption: This workflow gives an indication of the many considerations which should
  be accounted for when selecting the most appropriate animal in which to model a
  particular disease. The top priority should be to select a model that recapitulates
  the condition in its entirety; however, these are rare and often the price of carrying
  out such experiments can be prohibitive. The green arrows indicate the positive
  decisions and possible outcomes, with the red arrows representing a pathway which
  has been rejected and the blue arrows indicating alterative models
