caption: A. Insulin signals through at least two pathways to mobilize GLUT4 to the
  plasma membrane. One pathway comprises IRS-1, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K),
  and Akt2, which phosphorylates and inactivates the Rab GTPase Activating Proteins
  AS160/Tbc1D1 and/or Tbc1D4 to modulate Rab GTPase isoforms and direct vesicle trafficking.
  A second pathway is less well studied, and is proposed to involve signaling through
  APS/CAP/c-Cbl to CrkII and the Rho-family GTP Exchange Factor C3G, which activates
  the TC10α GTPase. TC10α then signals through its effector, PIST, to trigger TUG
  endoproteolytic cleavage. Because conflicting data have been reported for the TC10α
  pathway, upstream components are shown in gray. Insulin-stimulated cleavage separates
  regions of TUG that bind the Golgi matrix, including Golgin-160 and possibly other
  proteins, from those that bind GSV proteins, including GLUT4 and likely other cargos.
  Cleavage thus liberates GLUT4 for exocytic translocation to the plasma membrane.
  B. The domain structure of the TUG protein is depicted, with residues numbered according
  to the sequence of the mouse protein. Tandem ubiquitin-like domains (UBL1 and UBL2)
  are present at the N-terminus, and interact with GLUT4 and possibly other proteins
  present in GLUT4 vesicles. A third ubiquitin-like region, specifically a UBX domain,
  is also indicated (UBL3/UBX), and C-terminal regions of TUG bind to Golgin-160 and
  associated proteins at the Golgi matrix. Insulin stimulates cleavage of the bond
  linking residues Gly164 and Ser165. This cleavage site follows a Gly-Gly sequence,
  which is typical of ubiquitin-like precursor proteins. Proteolysis produces TUGUL,
  an 18 kD N-terminal product thought to function as a ubiquitin-like protein modifier,
  as well as a 42 kD C-terminal product. Cleavage separates regions of TUG that bind
  GSVs from regions that bind the Golgi matrix, and thus can liberate GSVs that are
  sequestered intracellularly at the Golgi matrix. Adapted from Bogan, J.S. et al.,
