caption: 'Modulation of podocyte Notch1 signaling in diabetic nephropathy (DN). (A)
  Pharmacological inhibition of active Notch1 inducers. Ang II and TGF-β drive podocyte
  injury in diabetes through the activation of Notch1 signaling. Following Jag1 engagement
  Notch1 is cleaved by γ-secretase and the released Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1),
  via Hes1, induces sustained Snail expression, which represses nephrin, leading to
  podocyte dedifferentiation. On the other hand, NICD1 downregulates Notch2 and NICD2
  and activates proapoptotic pathways, promoting podocyte apoptosis. Targeting Ang
  II by RAS inhibition and TGF-β-induced upregulation of Jag1 with the Rho kinase
  inhibitor fasudil prevents Notch1-mediated podocyte phenotypic changes and loss,
  ameliorating DN (B,C). Epigenetic regulation of Notch1 signaling through miRNAs
  (B) or posttranslational histone modification (C). (B) In normal, mature, differentiated
  podocytes miR-146a and miRNA 34a/c prevent Notch1 signaling activation by targeting
  the 3′UTR of Notch1 or both Notch1 and Jag1, thus decreasing their mRNA and protein
  expression. Conversely, diabetes and hyperglycemia-induced downregulation of miR-146a
  and miRNA 34a/c result in Notch1 signaling activation in podocytes (C) In healthy
  podocytes the trimethylation of lysine residue 27 on histone protein H3 (H3K27me3)
  in the Jag1 promoter and the Sirt6-mediated deacetylation of lysine residue nine
  on histone protein H3 (H3K9) in the Notch1 promoter keep the Notch1 signaling pathway
  silent. In diabetes, reduced H3K27me3 – dependent on the overexpression of the demethylase
  UTX–and increased H3K9ac due to Sirt6 downregulation relieve the repression of Jag1
  and Notch1, respectively, switching on Notch1 signaling in podocytes. ACEi, angiotensin
