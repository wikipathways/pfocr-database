  Nutraceutical-mediated signaling pathways underlying some neuroprotective
  processes. The brain accumulation of nutraceuticals leads to the activation
  of pathways such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which induces
  the expression of antiapoptotic genes and downregulates the proapoptotic
  program. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway also promotes neurotrophin
  production (growth factors) and other elements essential in neuronal
  differentiation, maturation, and survival. On the other hand, the
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway modulates the tau hyperphosphorylation
  ratio, modulating the axon stability and transport. Most nutraceuticals
  significantly affect the Aβ peptide aggregation, inhibiting
  the activation of proinflammatory processes and apoptosis and demonstrating
  their multimodal neuroprotective potential. Up arrows: denote upregulation
  of activity and expression. Down arrows: denote downregulation of
  activity and expression. ADAM10 = A disintegrin and metalloproteinase
  domain-containing protein 10. APP = Amyloid precursor protein. Aβ
  = Amyloid beta. BACE1 = Beta secretase 1. PSEN1 = Presenilin 1. GFR
  = Growth factor receptor. TNFR = Tumor necrosis factor receptor. RAGE
  = Receptor for advanced glycation end products. LTP = Long-term potentiation.
