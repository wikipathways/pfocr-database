caption: Proposed model of how 4-1BB signaling enhances the anti-tumor activity of
  2028Z CAR-T cells. The NF-κB pathway is more active in 2028Z-4-1BB CAR-T cells than
  in 2028Z CAR-T cells. The expression of exhaustion marker PD-1 and pro-apoptotic
  active Caspase-3 is reduced in 2028Z-4-1BB CAR-T cells, compared with 2028Z CAR-T
  cells. These molecular mechanisms lead to enhanced proliferation, cytotoxicity ability,
  and anti-tumor activity of 2028Z-4-1BB CAR-T cells.
