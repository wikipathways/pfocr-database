caption: LPS-TLR4 activates the NF-κB signaling pathway. During this process, MyD88
  is recruited to TLR4. Then, IRAKs and TRAF6 are activated step by step. Herein,
  TRAF6 activates the TAK1 molecule, which is essential for subsequent activation
  of the IKK complex. The IKK complex can phosphorylate the IκB molecule, which ultimately
  undergoes ubiquitination and degradation. Then, the NF-κB, consisting of the subunits
  p50 and p65, will translocate into the nucleus to initiate the transcriptions of
  genes encoding IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. IKK, inhibitor of κB kinase; IRAK, IL-1 receptor–associated
  kinase; I-κB, inhibitor of κB; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NEMO, NF-κB
  essential modulator; P, phosphorylation; TAK1, TGF-β–activated kinase 1; TLR4, Toll-like
  receptor 4; TRAF6, TNF receptor–associated factor 6; Ub, ubiquitination; ↑, increase.
