caption: 'Effect of garlic on blood pressure via the NO pathway.Notes: Blue rectangles
  illustrate metabolites, blue circles represent enzymes, orange circles are dietary
  cofactors, green star shapes are garlic and other organosulfur-containing nutrients,
  red rectangle represents NO, and purple rectangles denote direct and indirect influence
  of NO on vasodilation and blood pressure. NO pathway: in the presence of BH4, eNOS
  produces NO, which triggers pathways leading to smooth muscle cell relaxation and
  vasodilation. eNOS uncoupling leads to the formation of O2−. NO and O2− combine
  to form OONO−, which rapidly reacts with thiols and tyrosine residues of proteins,
  which in turn, leads to vasodilation and BP reduction independent of cGMP. Garlic
  and other dietary organosulfides may play a role in the regulation of the NO signaling
  pathway by creating a more reductive environment and therefore supporting NO production.Abbreviations:
  BH2, dihypdrobiopterin; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; Ca2+, calcium ion; cGMP, cyclic-guanosyl-monophosphate;

  free glutathione; GTP, guanosyl-tri-phosphate; NO, nitric oxide (radical); ONOO,
