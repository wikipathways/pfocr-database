caption: The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2) induces angiotensin (1–7) [Ang-(1–7)]
  development of angiotensin-2(AngII). Ang(1–7) causes AT2R, which is the angiotensin
  receptor type-2.On the other hand, it has been shown that ACE-2/Ang(1–7)/Mas causes
  Bcl-2/Beclin1 or Bcl-2/Bax complex stability and inhibits autophagy and apoptosis
  in the cardio-respiratory system respectively. Ang(1–7) can inhibit phosphorylation
  by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase(JNK). Apoptosis and autophagy are regulated by the
  complexes Bcl-2/Beclin1 and Bcl-2/Bax. Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein that interacts
  with Beclin1 (the key protein involved in autophagy) and Bax(the main protein involved
  in autophagy) in an unphosphorylated form. Induction of Bcl-2 phosphorylation after
  indications of autophagy or apoptosis such as dysfunction in the signaling pathway
  of ACE-2/Mas / Ang (1–7), which occurred in patient with underlying cardio-respiratory
  disease, activating JNK which led to phosphorylation (inactivation) of Bcl-2 and
  dissociation of this protein from Beclin1 or Bax and thus causes autophagy or apoptosis
  in respiratory and cardiac tissue of patients and increased their mortality rate.
  Some indirect evidence indicates that one of the key causes of increased mortality
  rates in high-risk patients with COVID-19 virus infection is lower expression and
  inactivation of ACE-2/Mas / Ang (1–7) in the cardiovascular system, resulting in
  activation of JNC / Bcl-2-Beclin1 or JNC / Bcl-2-bax signaling pathway and initiation
  of autophagy or apoptosis and thus death signal
