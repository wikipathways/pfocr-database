caption: In vitro and animal studies have shown that statins exert antineoplastic
  effects through both HMG-CoA reductase-dependent and HMG-CoA reductase-independent
  pathways. The primary mechanism of action of statins on cholesterol reduction is
  by competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting step in cholesterol
  biosynthesis, blocking the conversion of HMG-CoA into mevalonate. Consequently,
  statins can inhibit several of the downstream products of the mevalonate pathway
  including the generation of isoprenoids. This prevents post-translational prenylation
  of small signaling G-proteins of the Ras/Rho/Rac superfamily, which are important
  mediators of cell growth, differentiation and survival. They also exert pro-apoptotic
  effects through regulation of Rho and RAF-mitogen activated protein kinase 1-extracellular
  regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) pathway through a HMG-CoA reductase dependent mechanism,
  by activating caspases and decreasing Bcl-2.,  Statins inhibit the activation of
  the proteosome pathway, limiting the breakdown of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
  p21 and p27, thus allowing these molecules to exert their growth-inhibitory effects.
  In addition, they also exert an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects,
  modifying the cell adhesion cascade through both HMG-CoA reductase-dependent and
  HMG-CoA reductase-independent effects.
