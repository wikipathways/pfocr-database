caption: Regulation of Ski and SnoN expression by different mechanisms. Several signaling
  pathways and factors induce Ski and Skil gene expression; whereas, the TGF-β signaling
  pathway enhances or inhibits Skil gene expression via Smad2/4 or Smad3/4, respectively.
  Moreover, some miRNAs control the mRNA levels of these genes. The Ski and SnoN protein
  levels are also regulated by different signals
papertitle: Transcriptional cofactors Ski and SnoN are major regulators of the TGF-β/Smad
  signaling pathway in health and disease.
