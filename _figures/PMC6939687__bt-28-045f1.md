caption: HIF-VEGF axis and Notch signaling cooperatively regulate endothelial specification.
  (A) In hypoxia regions, HIF-1α can be upregulated in ECs and astrocytes, leading
  to enhanced VEGF-A secretion. All ECs become activated by VEGF-A stimulation to
  express Notch and Dll4. (B) Notch signaling induces lateral inhibition and gives
  rise to nonuniform population of ECs in the presence of VEGF-A stimulation. Stalk
  cells are subject to enhanced Notch signaling, which represses VEGFR2 transcription,
  while stimulating the expression of the decoy receptor, soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1).
  Tip cells receive a low Notch signal, allowing for high VEGFR2 and low sVEGFR1.
