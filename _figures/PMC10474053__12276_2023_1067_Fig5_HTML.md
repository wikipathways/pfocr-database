caption: Under normal physiological conditions, insulin-stimulated PI3K phosphorylates
  PI(4,5)P2 to produce PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4,5)P3 recruits PH domain-carrying AKT to
  the plasma membrane, where activated AKT phosphorylates IP3Rs, reducing intracellular
  Ca2+ release from the ER. Alternatively, AKT phosphorylates PLN, a critical negative
  regulator of SERCAs in the ER, thereby promoting SERCA activity and decreasing intracellular
  Ca2+ levels by transporting Ca2+ from the cytosol to the ER lumen. Under pathological
  conditions, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia, however, metabolic stress may increase
  ORAI and IP3R expression, leading to intracellular Ca2+ overload. In the mitochondria,
  Ca2+ overload correlates with increased ROS levels and decreased ATP production.
  Reduced ATP production may decrease SERCA and PMCA expression and activity, contributing
  to the depletion of ER Ca2+ and increasing intracellular Ca2+ and mitochondrial
  Ca2+ overload. In addition, ER Ca2+ depletion may increase the UPR and ER stress
  response. Thus, ER Ca2+ depletion and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload may exacerbate
  intracellular Ca2+ overload. Increased intracellular Ca2+ also decreases autophagosome
  biogenesis and decreases the autophagy rate. Moreover, increased intracellular Ca2+
  activates CnA to dephosphorylate CRTC2, promoting its nuclear translocation, and
  activates CaMK to phosphorylate FOXO, leading to increased gluconeogenesis in the
  liver. In metabolic diseases, Ca2+ is released from lysosomes through TRPML (transient
  receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin subfamily, member), leading to local
  CnA activation and TFEB dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylated TFEB transcriptionally
  activates the lysosomal/autophagic pathway. The resulting ER Ca2+ depletion and
  mitochondrial Ca2+ overload may trigger a vicious cycle of intracellular Ca2+ overload,
  which contributes to the development of insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders
  by activating Ca2+-dependent cellular pathways.
