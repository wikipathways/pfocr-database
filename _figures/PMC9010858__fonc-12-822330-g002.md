caption: 'Drug discovery in retinoblastoma. Left: Pathways shown to be deregulated
  in retinoblastoma and drugs targeting them that may represent future candidates
  for translation into the clinic. These include agents that disrupt the interaction
  between MDM2/MDM4 and p53 (e.g., nutlin); proteasome, and histone deacetylase (HDAC)
  inhibitors; bromodomain extra-terminal (BET) proteins inhibitors, which may be selectively
  active against tumors with MYCN amplification; and a genetically modified adenovirus
  that selectively replicates in cells with high levels of free E2F transcription
  factor resulting from a dysfunctional RB1 pathway. Right: Proposed immunotherapy
  approaches in retinoblastoma, namely, anti-GD2 and anti-NcGM3 monoclonal antibodies,
  anti-GD2CART cells, and inhibitors of immune checkpoints as PD-1/PD-L1 and B7H3
  (omburtamab). In the presence of anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies, retinoblastoma
  cells may be targeted by the immune system, as described in neuroblastoma, via a
  response including granulocyte- and natural killer-mediated antibody-dependent cellular
  cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement- and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity.'
