caption: Models for cellulose production regulation in Salmonella and E. coli. Schematic
  regulation of cellulose production via a CsgD/AdrA pathway in Salmonella and some
  E. coli strains (A, in LB at 28째C) and via a CsgD-independent and YedQ-dependent
  pathway in E. coli 1094 (B, minimal or LB medium, 30 or 37째C). In both cases, the
  RpoS sigma factor regulates csgD expression via MlrA. Although CsgD is the central
  regulator for curli and cellulose production in Salmonella (A), it regulates only
  curli synthesis in E. coli 1094 (B). In both pathways, the cellulose operons bcsA-C
  and bcsE-G, as well as the production of c-di-GMP, are required for cellulose synthesis,
  biofilm formation, and expression of the cellular morphotype. In the case of E.
  coli 1094, RpoS regulates cellulose production via a yet-uncharacterized pathway.
  Production of c-di-GMP depends on the diguanylate cyclase activity of the GGDEF
  domain of the AdrA (A) or the YedQ (B) protein. Both proteins are membrane proteins,
  but they differ in their N-terminal domains. Both proteins are schematically represented
  with their N-terminal domains anchored at the membrane (IM, inner membrane; OM,
  outer membrane).
