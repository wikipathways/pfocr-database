caption: 'ReactomeFIViz: from disease pathway to PPI network. Main steps to obtain
  a protein functional and a physical protein network, starting from a specific pathway
  (oncogene induced senescence). Using ReactomeFIViz, pathways can be visualized in
  relation with others (a), can be detailed as a diagram showing all intermolecular
  relationships (b), and as a protein functional interaction network (c) showing just
  the relation among proteins that cooperate to perform a given molecular function.
  Finally, starting from a group of protein of interest, it is possible to obtain
  a network of protein-protein interactions by STRING; in the reported example, the
  interactions shown are limited to physical type, in particular binding, activation
  and inhibition (d)'
