caption: Cholesterol synthesis occurs through diverging pathways for different neuronal
  cell types. Cholesterol synthesis acts through the mevalonate pathway. Acetyl CoA
  is converted to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA). HMG CoA is then converted
  to mevalonate via HMG-CoA reductase, and this is the rate limiting step in cholesterol
  synthesis. Via a complex series of reactions that involve multiple enzymes and reaction
  steps, mevalonate is converted to squalene. Squalene is converted to lanosterol
  in an essential cyclization process. From here, the Kandutsch-Russel pathway, which
  is favored by neuronal cells, produces cholesterol from lanosterol, while the Bloch
  pathway synthesizes cholesterol that is favored by glial cells. After cholesterol
  is synthesized, it can be further metabolized into vitamin D, steroid hormones,
  or bile acids, or it may be incorporated into cellular membranes.
