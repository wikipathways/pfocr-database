caption: Diagram for the amelioration of gut metabolite 3-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid
  on the aging-related spermatogenic dysfunction. The altered GM abundance in intestine
  were closely related to the changed gut bacteria-derived metabolite, 3-Hydroxyphenylacetic
  acid (3-HPAA). 3-HPAA promotes GPX4-mediated reduction of intracellular phospholipid
  hydroperoxides (PL-OOH) and 3-HPAA-related metabolic pathway may alleviate the impaired
  spermatogenesis of aging mice through regulation of ferroptosis
