caption: 'Main signaling pathways supposed to be activated in MEC exposed to either
  E. coli crude LPS (a) or S. aureus culture supernatant (b). Crude LPS (a simplified
  substitute of outer membrane vesicles, omv) is sensed by both TLR2 and TLR4, which
  activates the NF-κB pathway by the MyD88-dependent pathway. In addition, the TRAM-TRIF-IRF3
  pathway leads to the activation of genes that have an IRF-binding site in their
  promoter sequence. S. aureus culture supernatant (SaS) is sensed by TLR2 and other
  unidentified receptors that activate the NF-κB and AP-1 pathways. As a result, E.
  coli stimulation induces a higher number of genes (IFN-stimulated genes) than does
  S. aureus stimulation. This is exemplified by the overexpression of a panel of chemokine
  genes that have the potential to recruit a greater variety of leukocytes (see text).
