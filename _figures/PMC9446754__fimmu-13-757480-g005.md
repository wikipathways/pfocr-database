caption: 'Mechanisms of CD47-induced caspase-independent cell death.CD47 induces a
  caspase-independent cell death, characterized by intact or slightly modified nuclei,
  reduced cell viability (). The process of cell apoptosis includes PS (phosphatidylserine)
  exposure, disruption of mitochondrial function, and cytoskeleton rearrangement (1):
  K+ is a critical component of volume regulatory response, and leakage of K+ is a
  simple way to accommodate a rapid decrease in cell volume; CD47-induced cell death
  was dependent on K+ efflux (); (2) Mechanisms involved in PS exposure remain poorly
  understood. Veronique M et al. proposed that CD47 ligation initially induce triggering
  of actin polymerization, perhaps via Cdc42/WASP pathway. This event then leads to
  mitochondrial changes including matrix swelling and ΔΨm (mitochondrial transmembrane
  potential) loss, followed by PS exposure or bypass of mitochondria and direct induction
  of PS externalization (); (3) In addition, Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein 19
  kDa interacting protein-3 (BNIP3) is indispensable for the pro-apoptotic effect
  of CD47 (). A simple model-based on the translocation of BNIP3 from the inner surface
  of the cell membrane to the mitochondria is proposed since BNIP3 can only exert
  its pro-apoptotic effect at the mitochondria membrane ().'
