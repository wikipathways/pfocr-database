caption: The OleTJE catalytic cycle. OleTJE catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation
  of fatty acids (major reaction) and can also hydroxylate fatty acids at the α- and
  β-positions (minor reaction). The canonical P450 catalytic cycle is shown in circular
  representation, initiating with the binding of fatty acid substrate (shown as RH,
  and also as a chemical structure) that converts the LS OleTJE P450 to a HS form.
  Shown in gray arrows from this point onwards are reduction (×2) and protonation
  (×1) steps that follow the canonical path and require one or more redox partners.
  The thick black arrow traversing the cycle illustrates the “peroxide shunt” pathway
  by which ferric, fatty acid-bound OleTJE can be converted directly to the transient
  ferric-hydroperoxo (compound 0) form using H2O2. At this point, the canonical and
  peroxide shunt pathways converge with a protonation step that results in dehydration
  of a transient intermediate to form the ferryl-oxo compound I. Compound I deprotonates
  the substrate, producing a substrate radical and the ferryl-hydroxo compound II.
  At this stage, the catalytic pathways for substrate hydroxylation and decarboxylation
  diverge. Hydroxylated fatty acids are formed by the “radical rebound” mechanism
  (), as shown in the outer loop to the left of the main cycle (gray arrows). However,
  recent studies have indicated that that fatty acid decarboxylation to form terminal
  alkenes likely involves an unusually stable compound II and that reduction of compound
  II (or another oxidant) by the substrate radical could form a substrate diradical
  or carbocation species that decomposes with CO2 release to form the terminal alkene
  product (, ). The P450 heme (illustrated by the iron in the relevant oxidation state
  and equatorial/axial bonds) is shaded to approximate the color of the relevant heme
  intermediate species.
