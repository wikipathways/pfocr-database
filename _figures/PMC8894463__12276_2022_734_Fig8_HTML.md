caption: In response to I/R insults, TRIM45 expression levels in microglia are upregulated.
  TRIM45 increases the K63-linked ubiquitination of TAB2, followed by recruitment
  of TAK1/TAB1 to TAB2, thus potentiating the phosphorylation and activation of TAK1.
  TAK1 sequentially activates the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines and ultimately enhancing neuroinflammatory injury.
  The combined effects of these ischemic signaling cascades lead to profound cerebral
  injury. Thus, TRIM45 ablation might alleviate neuronal injury via the inhibition
  of excessive microglial activation after ischemic stroke.
