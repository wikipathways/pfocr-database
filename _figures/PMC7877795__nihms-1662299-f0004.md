caption: Classical monocytes are recruited to both primary and metastatic sites via
  a CCL2-CCR2 driven chemokine signaling pathway. In the primary tumor, these recruited
  monocytes undergo sequential development into TAMs, which are first involved in
  a streaming behavior that drives tumor cell invasion via a CSF1-Epidermal growth
  factor (EGF) paracrine loop, before being recruited to vessels by fibroblast expressed
  CXCL12. On the vessel, these TAMs enhance tumor cell intravasation by expressing
  VEGFA. At metastatic sites, the circulating tumor cells recruit classical monocytes
  expressing VEGFA (causing vessel permeability) that upon arrival, promotes the extravasation
  of the latter. Subsequent signaling pathways (as indicated), result in monocyte
  differentiation through a progenitor stage (MAMPC) --that is immuno-suppressive
  via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-- into a MAM that confers survival
  signals to tumor cells via vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1) engagement.
  These MAMs further differentiate, supporting metastatic tumor growth via the depicted
  signaling pathways; this process occurs in part via inhibition of cytotoxic CD8+
  T cells and NK cell effector functions.
