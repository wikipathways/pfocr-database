caption: Potential immune-based treatment options for the treatment of metastatic
  melanoma. (A) Various immune-based treatment options are available to treat patients
  harboring metastatic melanoma, including high-dose IL-2, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
  (TIL), lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK), and TCR-transgenic T cells directed
  against specific melanoma-associated antigens such as MART-1. More recently, immune
  checkpoint blockade using antagonistic monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-1
  and CTLA-4, as well as specific molecular targeting of BRAFV600E, have been employed.
  These strategies have had varying degrees of success in the treatment of metastatic
  melanoma. (B) Potential mechanisms of melanoma resistance to T cell-based therapy.
  Various inherent (primary) or acquired (secondary) mechanisms have been implicated
  in the resistance of melanoma to T cell-based therapies. These resistance mechanisms
  may include deregulation of apoptotic machinery, favoring an anti-apoptotic phenotype
  to melanomas, loss of PTEN, and constitutive activation of the AKT signaling transduction
  pathway, leading to melanoma survival. Loss of the β2M component HAL A2.1, downregulation
  (internalization) or shedding of the MHC complex, or loss of TAA (such as MART-1)
  will render melanomas unrecognized by T cells. For additional information, refer
  to the text.
