caption: Arctiin attenuates the effects of 7-KC by decreasing the oxidized TFEB signaling
  pathway, thereby disturbing TFEB nuclear localization. Moreover, arctiin increases
  the expression of Nrf2, catalase, and HO-1, resulting in decreased ROS and subsequently
  impairing the activity of 7-KC in OCs, thus highlighting the therapeutic potential
  of arctiin to prevent cholesterol-induced bone loss.
