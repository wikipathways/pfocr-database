caption: Schematic overview of the proposed signaling pathway involved in PM10-induced
  IL-6 expression in HaCaT cells. PM10-induced ROS generation is modulated by 7S MaR1
  via the recovery of ROS scavenger genes. 7S MaR1 reduces PM10-induced IL-6 expression
  via modulating the p38/ERK/NF-κB signaling pathways. 7S MaR1 can resolve inflammation
  caused by PM10 induced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines
