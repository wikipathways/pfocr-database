caption: Schematic model linking the miR390/TAS3 module with the nodulation signaling
  pathway and their functions in the development of lateral root organs in M. truncatula.
  The miR390/TAS3 regulatory module, which leads to the production of tasiARFs, represses
  the expression of the auxin transcription factors ARF2/3/4 (; ). This module increases
  auxin signaling/response and promotes lateral root growth (; this work). Enhanced
  auxin sensitivity negatively affects rhizobial infection and nodulation (; this
  work). The miR390/TAS3 pathway also negatively regulates, by unknown mechanisms,
  the expression of NSP1 and NSP2, two genes strictly required for nodulation (; ).
  Activation of the miR390/TAS3 pathway negatively affects nodulation and rhizobial
  infection, either through the regulation of NSP1 and NSP2 and/or by an independent
  mechanism. The nodulation signaling pathway involves the perception of Nod factor
  (NF) and the activation of CCaMK, referred as DMI3 in M. truncatula (). DMI3 interacts
  with and activates IPD3 (; ), initiating a cascade of transcription factors that
  include NIN, NF-YA1/NF-YA2, NSP1/NSP2, and ERN1 (; ; ). ERN1 and NIN are direct
  targets of NSP1/NSP2 (). ERN1 is also a direct target of an NF-Y heterotrimeric
  complex that includes NF-YA1/NF-YA2 (). ERN1 and NIN are directly regulated by IPD3
  (; ). Both ERN1 and NSP1/NSP2 bind to independent regions in the promoter of the
  ENOD11 gene, activating its expression (; ). NIN negatively regulates ENOD11 in
  the epidermis (). NF-YA1 is a target of miR169, whereas NSP2 is a target of miR171h
  (; ).
