caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism in HHS against UC. Network
  pharmacology was used to analyze the crucial ingredients and key targets of HHS
  in the treatment of UC; molecular docking revealed that three candidate compounds
  could bind well with three candidate targets, respectively; cell experiments confirmed
  that candidate compound quercetin can alleviate inflammation in LPS-induced RAW264.7
  cells by inhibiting inflammatory factors, phosphorylated c-Jun, as well as downregulating
  PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
