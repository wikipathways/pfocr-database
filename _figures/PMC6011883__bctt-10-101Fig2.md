caption: 'Mutant p53 (mutp53) forms complexes with cytoplasmic mediators of signal
  transduction.Notes: (A) Mutp53 binds and inhibits the tumor suppressor DAB2IP in
  the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells, reducing TNF-induced activation of the proapoptotic
  ASK1–JNK axis, simultaneously promoting activation and of proinvasive NFκB transcription
  factor. (B) Mutp53 inhibitory action on DAB2IP promotes insulin-induced activation
  of the PI3K–Akt pathway, enhancing cell proliferation and invasion in hormone-independent
  breast and prostate cancers. (C) Mutp53 binds the AMPKα subunit and inhibits AMPK
  activation upon energy stress. This leads to increased anabolic growth of tumor
  cells and cancer progression. (D) Mutp53 binds the monomeric GTPase Rac1, protecting
  it from SENP1-mediated de-SUMOylation. SUMOylated Rac1 is more active, sustaining
  tumor growth and dissemination.'
