caption: 'Overview of signaling pathways against resistant cancer. Plant-derived natural
  products can achieve practical anti-resistant-cancer effects through multiple mechanisms,
  including induction of apoptosis and autophagy, blocked cell cycle, and inhibition
  of cell proliferation. For example, they could exert anticancer effects through
  reducing the expression of MDR-related protein and increasing the concentration
  of the drug. Moreover, they could induce autophagy by increasing the expression
  of Beclin-1. They can inhibit the expression of Atg and subsequently increase the
  ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I. Furthermore, they can promote apoptosis through activation
  of STAT3 and Notch-1, upregulating the expression of Bax, decreasing the expression
  of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, and suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and caspase
  cascade reaction. In addition, they can reduce the transcriptional activities of
  MMP-2 and MMP9 to inhibit metastasis; they also suppress migration through reducing
  the expression of VEGF. In the next place, natural plants can reduce cancer cell
  proliferation by binding PI3K and subsequently regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.
  In addition, they can induce cell death through the Hedgehog signaling pathway.
  Moreover, they can block the cell cycle by inhibiting the levels of cyclin-dependent
  kinases. Abbreviations: JAK; Janus kinase, GDP; guanosine diphosphate, GTP; guanosine
  triphosphate, CytC; cytochrome c, Fas; factor-associated suicide, FasL; Fas ligand'
