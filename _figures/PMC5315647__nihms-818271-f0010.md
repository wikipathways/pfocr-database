caption: In melanocytes, enhancement of nucleotide excision repair by cAMP is dependent
  on a post-translational modification of ATR. MC1R activation by melanocortins results
  in PKA-induced phosphorylation of ATR at the S435 residue. This event promotes binding
  between XPA and ATR in the nucleus and together ATR and XPA localize to UV photodamage
  in an accelerated and enhanced manner. MC1R agonists α-MSH or ACTH activate PKA-mediated
  ATR phosphorylation and nucleotide excision repair whereas MC1R antagonists ASIP
  or βD3 inhibit this repair-enhancing pathway. In this way, genomic stability and
  susceptibility to UV mutagenesis in melanocytes may be hormonally influenced.
