caption: Evasion of innate immunity by HCV viral proteins. HCV NS3/4A protease cleaves
  the TRIF and MAVS adapters, thereby crippling innate immune antigen recognition
  and type I IFN induction signaling. NS5A interacts with MyD88 to inhibit TLR signaling.
  NS5A inhibits PKR activation via its ISDR, resulting in IFN resistance. The HCV
  IRES can bind to the dsRNA-binding domain of PKR and can increase PKR autophosphorylation
  and activation, thereby enhancing viral protein translation. Furthermore, HCV-mediated
  phosphorylation and activation of PKR inhibits its downstream target eIF2α and attenuates
  the expression of ISGs, promoting viral replication. The E2 protein antagonizes
  the PKR-dependent activation of host eIF2α, resuming translation. NS4B interacts
  with STING/MITA to inhibit downstream IRF3 signaling. Moreover, core induces the
  expression of SOCS3 and attenuates the STAT1 phosphorylation pathway. Expression
  of HCV induces the expression of PP2A, which inhibits PRMT1 enzymatic activity.
  Inhibition of PRMT1 activity decreases methylation of STAT1, which favors binding
  to PIAS1, resulting in the disruption of STAT1 signaling, impairment of ISG production,
  and HCV evasion of innate immunity. Additionally, decreased PRMT1 activity enhances
  NS3 helicase activity, which in turn promotes virus replication. eIF2α, eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2α HCV, hepatitis C virus; IFN, interferon; IRF, IFN regulatory
  factor; ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; MAVS, mitochondria antiviral signaling protein;
