caption: 'Schematic of the proposed mechanism of TGFBR1 in arthrofibrosis after TKA.The
  TGF-β signaling pathway starts with TGFBR1 binding with TGFBR2 when induced by the
  TGF-β ligands. Then, the kinase activity of TGFBR1 is activated, which phosphorylated
  SMAD2/3 (Canonical pathway) and non-canonical downstream components (Non-canonical
  pathways). The activated SMAD2/3 can form a complex with SMAD4 and translocate to
  the nucleus. These signaling factors lead to the expression of profibrotic genes
  including collagens, fibronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and tissue inhibitor
  of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP). Other TGFβ-induced non-Smad signaling pathways
  include PI3K-AKT, the small GTPases Rho and MAPK pathways can also regulate the
  transcription and induce matrix deposition.In the setting of tissue injury, as in
  TKA, fibroblasts are stimulated by hypoxia and activates inflammasomes in cells.
  The mixture of cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ) upregulate the TGFBR1 while the
  TGF-b activates this signal pathway. These events stimulate fibroblasts to proliferation
  and differentiate into myofibroblasts which promote contraction and the upregulation
  of ECM protein production. The excessive ECM and focal adhesions become more complex
  and form fibrotic scar over time.Abbreviations in the figure: P in the yellow circle,
