caption: The AtPeps-PEPR Signaling Pathway Activates S-Type Anion Channels in Guard
  Cell.AtPeps bind to the receptor kinases PEPR1 or PEPR2, which recruit the coreceptor
  BAK1 and BIK1 to form a receptor complex. The interaction between these receptors
  activates BIK1 by phosphorylation. BIK1 is released from the receptor complex after
  activation, and it may directly or indirectly activate the S-type anion channels
  SLAC1 and SLAH3, leading to anion efflux in guard cells. ABA interacts with its
  receptor PYR/PYL/RCAR to inhibit PP2Cs activity and activate OST1. The flg22 peptide
  is perceived by the receptor complex consisting of FLS2, BAK1, and BIK1. The flg22-FLS2
  pathway merges with the ABA pathway at the point of OST1. OST1 directly phosphorylates
  and activates SLAC1-mediated anion efflux.
