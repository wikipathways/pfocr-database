caption: The gene or protein expression of GLUT1, HK1, PGM1, UGP2, GALT, GALE, SLC35A2,
  LALBA, and B4GALT1 on the lactose synthesis pathway throughout lactation. The mRNA
  or protein expressions of GLUT1, HK1, PGM1, UGP2, SLC35A2, LALBA, and B4GALT1 were
  upregulated (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of GALE did not change, and the mRNA
  expression of GALT was downregulated
papertitle: GLUT1 and lactose synthetase are critical genes for lactose synthesis
  in lactating sows.
