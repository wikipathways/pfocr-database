caption: 'The role of Nrf2 in the metabolism of rapidly proliferating cells. Nrf2
  is a positive regulator of genes encoding enzymes in both the oxidative arm [i.e.,
  glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD)]
  and the nonoxidative arm [i.e., transaldolase 1 (TALDO1) and transketolase (TKT)]
  of the pentose phosphate pathway. G6PD and PGD generate NADPH. Nrf2 also regulates
  the gene expression of the other two NADPH-generating enzymes, malic enzyme 1 (ME1)
  and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). The gene expression of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate
  amidotransferase (PPAT), which catalyzes the entry into the de novo purine biosynthetic
  pathway, is also positively regulated by Nrf2, as is the expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2), a mitochondrial enzyme with a critical role in providing
  one-carbon units for de novo purine biosynthesis. Pyruvate kinase (PK) is negatively
  regulated by Nrf2 and is expected to favor the buildup of glycolytic intermediates
  and, together with G6PD, metabolite channeling through the pentose phosphate pathway
  and the synthesis of nucleic acids, amino acids, and phospholipids. Nrf2 negatively
  regulates the gene expression of ATP-citrate lyase (CL), which may increase the
  availability of citrate for mitochondrial utilization or (through isocitrate) for
  IDH1. Red and blue indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively. The
