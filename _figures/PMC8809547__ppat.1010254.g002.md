caption: EBNA2 and MYC induce the 1C, glycolysis, and de novo serine synthesis pathways
  in B cells. They also up-regulate plasma membrane abundance of the GLUT1 and ASCT1/2
  transporters to increase glucose and serine import, respectively. Serine pools are
  further expanded by the de novo serine synthesis pathway, which metabolizes the
  glycolysis product 3-PG into serine and generate NADH and αKG byproducts. EBV also
  supports mitochondrial 1C metabolism via up-regulation of the SLC25A32 serine and
  SFXN1 folate transporters. Mitochondrial 1C metabolism converts serine into glycine,
  NADPH, and a serine-derived carbon unit (red ball), which is shuttled into the cytosol
  for use in purine and thymidylate biosynthesis. The carbon-loaded 1C folate carriers
  5-10-meTHF and 10-CHO-THF are shown. 1C, one-carbon; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 3-PHP,
  3-phosphohydroxypyruvate; P-ser, 3-phosphoserine; 5-10-meTHF, 5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate;
  10-CHO-THF, 10-formyl THF; EBNA2, Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen 2; EBV, Epstein–Barr
  virus.
