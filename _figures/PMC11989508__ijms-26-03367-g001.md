caption: 'The ER is a membranous network structure in eukaryotic cells, divided into
  the RER and the SER. The RER, studded with ribosomes, is responsible for the synthesis
  and modification of secretory proteins (e.g., glycosylation) and is highly developed
  in cells with active secretory functions. The SER lacks ribosomes and performs diverse
  roles, including steroid hormone synthesis (e.g., in adrenal cells), detoxification
  (e.g., in liver cells), calcium ion storage (e.g., in the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  regulating muscle contraction), and membrane lipid synthesis. The ER also participates
  in cellular signaling through calcium homeostasis regulation. When ER homeostasis
  is disrupted (e.g., due to hypoxia, misfolded protein accumulation, or calcium imbalance),
  ERS is triggered, prompting the cell to activate the UPR via three core pathways:
  (1) the IRE1 pathway, upon activation, cleaves XBP-1 mRNA to generate the transcription
  factor XBP-1, which upregulates chaperones (e.g., BiP) to enhance the protein-folding
  capacity; prolonged stress activates the JNK pathway to promote apoptosis; (2) the
  PERK pathway phosphorylates eIF2α to inhibit global protein synthesis while inducing
  ATF4 expression to activate stress adaptation genes (e.g., antioxidant genes); chronic
  activation upregulates the pro-apoptotic factor CHOP; (3) the ATF6 pathway is transported
  to the Golgi apparatus, where it is cleaved to release its active fragment, which
  enters the nucleus to activate ER function-related genes. These pathways synergistically
  reduce the unfolded protein burden and restore homeostasis. If stress persists and
  remains unresolved, the UPR shifts toward apoptosis. (“p” represents phosphorylation)'
