caption: Microbial dysbiosis alters molecular pathways in RIOM/CIOM. Chemotherapy
  and radiotherapy lead to microbiota dysbiosis, after which TLRs can bind to HMGB1
  as DAMPs from necrotic and apoptotic cells, as well as bacterial fragment PAMPs.
  Thus, TLRs upregulate NF-κB through the MyD88 signaling pathway and activate NLRs
  and proinflammatory reactions including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, promoting the damage
  of nucleic acids and the positive feedback of proinflammatory reactions to participate
  in RIOM/CIOM.
