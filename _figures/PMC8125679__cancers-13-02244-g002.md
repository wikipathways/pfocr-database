caption: 'Function and regulators of PSMA in prostate cancer cells. PSMA is a transmembrane
  protein expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells. In the dimeric form,
  PSMA can enzymatically hydrolyze glutamated folates producing glutamate and folates
  that can enter the cell through RFC or PCFT. Activation of mGluR by glutamate induces
  the release of calcium from the ER and activates cell survival associated with the
  PI3K-Akt pathway. In the absence of PSMA, Integrin β (Iβ) and IGF1-1R interact intracellularly
  with a scaffold protein RACK1 leading to the activation of the MAPK pathway. This
  interaction is disrupted by PSMA, changing the pathway activation from MAPK to PI3K-Akt
  in a switchlike manner. DHT is the physiological activator of AR. PSMA transcription
  is suppressed by AR after activation by DHT. Another potential repressor of PSMA
  transcription in prostate cancer cells is SOX7, which has been shown to bind to
  PSME. Cytoskeleton-related protein FLNa interacts with the intracellular domain
  of PSMA. FLNa interestingly also interacts with AR and BRCA1, and BRCA2. Abbreviations:
  PSMA = prostate-specific membrane antigen, FLNa = filamin A, G = glutamate, F =
  folate, RFC = reduced folate carrier, PCFT = proton-coupled folate transporter,
  mGluR = metabotropic glutamate receptor, ER = endoplasmic reticulum, Iβ = integrin
  β, IGF-1R = insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, RACK1 = receptor of activated
  protein C kinase 1, MAPK = mitogen-activated protein kinase, PI3K = phosphoinositide
  3-kinase, Akt/PKB = protein kinase B, DHT = dihydrotestosterone, AR = androgen receptor,
  PSME = PSMA enhancer, BRCA = breast cancer type 1 or 2 susceptibility protein, SOX7
  = SRY-Box transcription factor 7, Ca2+ = calcium ion.'
