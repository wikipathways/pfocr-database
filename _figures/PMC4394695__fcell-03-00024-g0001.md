caption: Nuclear distribution of the PI3K pathway. PI3K and many of its associated
  kinases (orange), phosphatases (blue), and phosphoinositides (yellow) reside natively
  in or translocate to the nucleus and nuclear sub-compartments, adding complexity
  to the established functional repertoire of the canonical PI3K pathway. The unique
  nuclear environment gives rise to non-canonical functions and molecular interactions
  not present in the cytoplasm. The uncertain role of nuclear PTEN in dephosphorylation
  of nuclear PI(3,4,5)P3 is denoted by a dotted line.
