caption: 'The Canonical and Noncanonical Inflammasome. The activation of the canonical
  NLR Inflammasome requires priming, typically via activation of a Toll-like receptor
  (TLR). Following ligation of the TLR, MyD88 is recruited and subsequently leads
  to the activation of NF-κB signaling. Activated NF-κB promotes the transcription
  of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Many mechanisms have been proposed for the activation
  of the NLR Inflammasome once priming has occurred: direct PAMP sensing, K+ efflux,
  pore forming channels and toxins, Ca2+ influx, reactive oxygen species from the
  mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA, cardiolipin translocation, FADD, caspase-8 and
  rupture of phagosomes. Upon activation from one of these mechanisms, the NLR, ASC
  and caspase-1 come together to form the core unit of the Inflammasome. This assembly
  leads to the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms and the
  induction of the pro-Inflammatory form of cell death defined as pyroptosis. In noncanonical
  Inflammasome activation, type I interferon is stimulated via the TLR-TRIF–mediated
  pathway, which drives STAT1 activation and leads to the induction of caspase-11
  expression. Gram-negative bacteria in the cytosol that escape vacuoles release their
  LPS inside the cell. This mechanism requires rupture of the vacuoles via interferon-inducible
  guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs). The binding of cytosolic LPS to caspase-11 induces
  its activation leading to pyroptosis and potentially feedback into the canonical
  Inflammasome pathway. Gasdermin D functions as a substrate for caspase-11 and the
  cleavage of gasdermin D is part of the driving force for the noncanonical Inflammasome
  mediated activation of pyroptosis, IL-1β maturation, and also functions to regulate
  epithelial cell proliferation.'
