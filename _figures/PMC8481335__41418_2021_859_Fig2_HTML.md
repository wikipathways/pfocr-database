caption: 'a Mitochondrial ROS. GPX4, SOD2, and MGST1 are mitochondria-associated antioxidant
  proteins, which play a major role in protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage
  during ferroptosis. In addition, mitochondrial DHODH limits ferroptosis through
  the reduction of CoQ10 to ubiquinol. Mitochondrial oxidative damage induces the
  release of AIFM1, which promotes ferroptosis through its translocation to the nucleus.
  The STING1-MFN1/2 pathway triggers ferroptosis by inducing mitochondrial fusion
  and subsequent ROS production. b Mitochondrial iron. Iron can be transported to
  the mitochondria via SLC25A37 and SLC25A28 and used to synthesize heme/Fe-S, or
  it can be stored in ferritin in mitochondria. Heme is catalyzed by HMOX1 and decomposes
  into Fe2+, and acts as a key cofactor of ETC by which heme promotes ferroptosis.
  The inhibition of iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins, including NFS1, FXN, and
  ISCU, can enhance ferroptosis by the activation of an IREB2-mediated iron-starvation
  response. Fe-S proteins CISD1 and CISD2 inhibit ferroptosis by decreasing intracellular
  iron levels. c Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). POLG (DNA polymerase) and DGUOK (deoxynucleoside
  synthesis enzyme) are required for mtDNA replication. The inhibition of POLG by
  zalcitabine and TFAM degradation induce mtDNA stress, which activates GAS-STING1
  pathway-dependent autophagy to mediate ferroptosis. d The TCA cycle transfers electrons
  to the ETC, which releases ROS to induce ferroptosis. The TCA cycle also enhances
  ferroptosis by promoting ACAC-mediated fatty acid synthesis. This effect is inhibited
  by PDK4-mediated glucose metabolism or enhanced by GLS2-mediated glutaminolysis.
  In addition, the suppression of MPC1 also enhances ferroptosis partly through increasing
  glutaminolysis. Abbreviations: ACAC acetyl-CoA carboxylase, AIFM1/AIF apoptosis-inducing
