caption: Within B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, the engagement of TLR7
  with ligands, hY3 and Alu RNA, in the context of the two-receptor hypothesis (not
  shown) results in activation of pathways driven by epigenetic modifications influencing
  the transcription factors STAT1 and NF-κB. Intracellular Ro60 will attenuate this
  response by reducing the available pool of hY3, Alu RNA, and other noncoding RNAs.
  In addition, hydroxychloroquine inhibits TLR-dependent epigenetic modifications
  and cytokine production. HCQ is specific to the endosome and does not block downstream
  autocrine-paracrine cytokine signaling. *TLR7 that has completed the transition
  from latent to an active form.
