caption: 'Schematic representation of shared physiopathological hallmarks in neurodegenerative
  diseases (NDs): (1) Mitochondrial dysfunction due to oxidative stress, aging, or
  because of genetic or environmental factors damage, resulting in the excessive production
  of ROS, which can activate p53 and the Bax (apoptotic regulator) translocation that
  allows the release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) leading the (Cas 9) and caspase 3 (Cas3)
  activation, resulting in DNA damage and cell death or (2) Apoptosis. Likewise, excessive
  ROS production also leads to oxidative stress and (3) Lipid Peroxidation, which
  can lead to protein aggregates such as α-synuclein as well as misfolded amyloid
  β peptide, the latter becoming an amyloid β (Aβ) plaque affecting neuron signaling
  induced by (4) Cholinergic Insufficiency. In turn, accumulation of Aβ plaque induces
  (5) Microglia Activation with the concomitant release of (6) Inflammatory Cytokines
  and produces neuroinflammation. On the other hand, (7) Dysregulation of Ca2+ because
  of neuronal membrane depolarization could induce synaptic deficits and promote the
  accumulation of Aβ plaques, and (8) Neurofibrillary Tangles through calpain activation.
  In addition, sustained calcium inflow results in over-activation of neuronal nitric
  oxide synthase (nNOS), with the increase in nitric oxide synthesis leading to oxidative
  stress/nitrosative stress and generalized brain inflammation. Moreover, ROS accumulation
  induces (9) kinases activation (glycogen synthase kinase-3β, GSK-3β) and induces
  tau hyperphosphorylation, promoting the accumulation of Aβ plaques. Accumulation
  of Aβ oligomers causes removal of insulin receptors (IRS) from the cell surface,
  inducing a (10) Neuronal Insulin Resistance and inhibiting the activation of glucose
  transporter type 4 (GLUT 4). Dysfunctional insulin signaling brings mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway down and results in (11) Autophagy failure to accumulate
  Aβ plaques. Finally, the synthesized cholesterol binds apolipoprotein E (APOE) to
  form APOE–cholesterol (APOE–CH) particles. APOE–CH particles are internalized into
  neurons, and the free cholesterol is metabolized to 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC),
  which subsequently passes through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and enters into
  plasma, while plasma (12) 27 hydroxylcholesterol (27-OHC) flows into the brain,
  increasing the level of α-synuclein and eventually forms Lewy bodies (LBs). Back
  lines indicate stimulation, while red lines indicate inhibition.'
