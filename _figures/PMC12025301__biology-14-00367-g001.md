caption: 'Mechanism of ferroptosis signaling pathway. As shown in the diagram, there
  are three ways (from left to right): 1. Iron Metabolism Pathway: Dysregulated iron
  homeostasis (e.g., iron overload or aberrant iron metabolism regulatory proteins)
  exacerbates lipid peroxidation via the Fenton reaction, which catalyzes reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generation. 2. Lipid Peroxide Accumulation Pathway: Glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4) maintains redox balance by reducing lipid peroxides. Its inactivation
  leads to lethal lipid peroxide accumulation, triggering ferroptosis. 3. Cellular
  Oxidative Stress Pathway: System Xc- mediates cystine uptake for glutathione biosynthesis.
  Blockade of this transporter results in glutathione depletion, subsequent GPX4 inactivation,
  and uncontrolled lipid peroxidation, ultimately inducing ferroptosis'
