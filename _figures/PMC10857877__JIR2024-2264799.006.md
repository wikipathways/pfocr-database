caption: Schematic representation of RND3 induction and interaction with TLR4 and
  IFNγ receptor signaling in activated proinflammatory macrophages. RND3 is transiently
  induced in macrophages activated through TLR-4 and IFN-γ. Afterward RND3 potentiates
  NOTCH1 activation in macrophages and this process enhances the NFκB and STAT1 transcriptional
  activity induced by TLR-4 and IFN-γ signaling pathway, respectively, resulting in
  the increased expression of STAT1 and NF-κB proinflammatory genes target genes,
  such as Tnf-α, Irf-1, or Cxcl-10 among others
