caption: Membrane machinery for nucleotide and nucleoside signaling. (1) ATP can be
  released by the cells in different ways, among which are membrane stress/damage,
  and molecular (Panx1, Connexin, P2X7) and vesicular transport. Once on the extracellular
  side of the membrane, ATP either follows a degradative pathway (2) or stimulates
  P2 receptors (3). In the first case, ATP, through the activity of the CD39 and CD73
  enzymes, is transformed into adenosine (ADO), activating P1 (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3)
  receptors. ADO can also be transported into the cell by ENT1 and ENT2 proteins or
  be inactivated to inosine (Ino) by CD26.
