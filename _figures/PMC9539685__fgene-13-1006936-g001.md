caption: TIPRL/PP2A axis and TOR signaling pathway. Active PP2A holoenzyme is an important
  inhibitor of the TOR signaling pathway. Besides, PP2A inhibits cancer cell growth
  and survival through dephosphorylation of 4E-binding protein 1 4EBP-1) and S6 kinase
  (S6K). PP2A holoenzymes can be inhibited as a result of α4/TIPRL-mediated recycling
  and disassembly of scaffold (A) and regulatory (B) subunits.
