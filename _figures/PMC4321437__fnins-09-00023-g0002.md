caption: Schematic representation of the main metabolic pathways involved in MG production
  and elimination. (A) MG is formed mainly by the fragmentation of the glycolytic
  intermediates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Glyceraldehyde-3P) and dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate (DHAP), but also from the metabolism of lipids and proteins (B). Phosphofructokinase-1
  (PFK) is the rate-limiting step of glycolysis and thus constitutes an important
  regulatory site, one of its most potent allosteric activators being Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
  (Fructose-2,6-P2). Fructose-2,6-P2 levels are controlled by the enzyme 6-phosphofructose-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase
  (Pfkfb) which is most abundantly expressed in astrocytes compared to neurons (Herrero-Mendez
  et al., ). (C) MG is detoxified principally via the glyoxalase system which consists
  of the enzymes Glyoxalase-1 (Glo-1) and Glyoxalase-2 (Glo-2). The first step in
  MG detoxification requires its spontaneous reaction with reduced glutathione (GSH)
  to form a hemithioacetal which is used as a substrate by Glo-1 to form S-Lactoylglutathione.
  Glo-2 then catalyzes the transformation of S-Lactoylglutathione into D-Lactate,
  recycling GSH in the process. (D) The pentose phosphate pathway is linked to MG
  detoxification via the formation of NADPH which is required for the recycling of
  GSH from its oxidized form (GSSG) via the action of glutathione reductase (GR).
