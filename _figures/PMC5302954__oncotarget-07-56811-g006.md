caption: After entering cancer cells via hENT1, Ara-C is phosphorylated to Ara-CTP,
  which enters the nucleus, and induces DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis. On
  the other hand, Ara-C activates the MAPK-Mnk-eIF4E pathway by inducing the phosphorylation
  of Erk1/2, p38 and eIF4E, causing an increase in the expression of the anti-apoptotic
  protein Mcl-1. Resistance to Ara-C treatment is due to increased cancer cell survival
  which may linked to elevated Mcl-1 expression. Mnk inhibition blocks eIF4E phosphorylation,
  thereby reducing Mcl-1 protein synthesis and enhancing the anti-leukemic activity
  of Ara-C.
