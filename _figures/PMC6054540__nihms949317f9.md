caption: Hepcidin expression is increased in breast cancer cells relative to non-cancer
  cells. A. In MCF-7 cells grown as 2D monolayers, BMP6 plays a dominant role in the
  cancer-dependent increase in hepcidin through activation of a SMAD1-5-8 signaling
  pathway. B. In breast cancer spheroids, spatial control of hepcidin synthesis is
  exerted by GDF-15, which augments SMAD 1-5- 8 signaling to further increase hepcidin
  synthesis. C. The microenvironment is an additional source for increased hepcidin
  in breast cancer cells, in part due to production of IL-6 by tumor-associated fibroblasts
  (TAFs).
