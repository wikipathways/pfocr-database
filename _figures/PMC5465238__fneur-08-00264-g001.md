caption: 'Schematic outline of intracellular Ras signaling pathways in the suprachiasmatic
  nucleus (SCN) regulating circadian clockwork. Solid lines show the signal pathways
  observed in the SCN, and broken lines indicate hypothetical pathways observed in
  other neuronal systems. Glutamate/NMDA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/TrkB
  are the major ligand–receptor systems within SCN involved in the light-induced phase
  shifting circadian clock. The light stimuli at night induce glutamate and BDNF release,
  which result in activation of NMDA receptors (with a subsequent influx of Ca2+,
  activating the Ca2+-calmodulin kinase II) and TrkB receptor that in turn stimulates
  Ras. Ras is also negatively regulated by the circadian protein SCN circadian oscillatory
  protein (SCOP). Ras activates ERK1,2 pathway, which couples to transcriptional factors
  CREB and Elk-1 phosphorylation, that regulate the transcription of the immediate
  early genes sFos, JunB, and EGR1, clock protein Per1, the regulator of ERK1,2 pathway
  MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). Enhanced Ras signaling via ERK1,2 also activates ETS-p300
  transcriptional complex, which in turn regulates circadian clock proteins modulator
  glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β). Other abbreviations are explained in manuscript.
  Please note: Ras downstream effector pathways other than RAF kinase, such as PI3
  kinase and Ral/GDF have been omitted for reasons of simplicity and lack of specific
  information in the SCN.'
