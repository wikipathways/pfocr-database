caption: Genomic signaling pathways for PR action. In response to ligand, PRs undergo
  a conformational change and dimerize. The receptors then translocate to the nucleus
  where they function as ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptors also
  activate cytoplasmic signaling cascades such as the ERK/MAPK pathway by interacting
  directly with extranuclear signaling molecules. BTA, basal transcriptional apparatus;
  CR, co-regulators.
