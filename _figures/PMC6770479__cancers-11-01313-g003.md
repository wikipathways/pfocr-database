caption: Schematic representation of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and pyroptosis
  in cancer cell. Apoptosis is induced via the intrinsic or extrinsic death signaling
  pathway. Chemotherapy induces DNA damage and activates p53, which interacts with
  Bax in mitochondria and triggers the mitochondria-dependent (intrinsic) apoptotic
  pathway. Detailedly, Bax promotes the release of cytochrome c and initiates the
  capase-9/caspase-3 cascade, resulting in cell apoptosis. In contrast, the extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway involves the binding of death ligands (e.g., Fas and TNF) to their
  receptors. This event gives rise to the activation of caspase-8. The latter evokes
  cell apoptosis by cleaving BID and directly activating caspase-3. In certain GSDME-expressing
  cancer cells, GSDME is able to switch chemotherapy-induced apoptosis to pyroptosis.
  Caspase-3 cleaves GSDME to generate the N-terminal fragment (GSDME-NT), which perforates
  the plasma membrane to execute pyroptosis. Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; Bcl-xL, B-cell
  lymphoma-extra large; Bak, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer; Bax, Bcl-2-associated
  X protein; BID, Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-interacting domain death agonist;
  tBID, truncated BID; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; PARP, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; GSDME, gasdermin E; GSDME-NT, the N-terminal
  fragment of GSDME.
