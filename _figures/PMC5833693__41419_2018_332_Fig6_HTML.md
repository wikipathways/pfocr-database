caption: A schematic diagram illustrating a possible GM-CSF-induced ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway in monocytes which is inhibited by a GC leading to Bad deactivation and
  subsequent apoptosis. GM-CSF binding to its receptor activates a Raf/MEK/ERK signaling
  cascade leading in turn to ribosomal associated p90RSK kinase activation. The pro-apoptotic
  Bad protein is phosphorylated by p90RSK and subsequently binds to the cytoskeletal
  scaffold protein, 14-3-3. In the absence of a growth factor or upon inhibition of
  the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by the pharmacological inhibitor (U0126) or a GC-induced
  phosphatase(s), p90RSK remains inactivated and is unable to phosphorylate Bad. Non-phosphorylated
  Bad in turn can interfere with the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and Bcl2, resulting
  in loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and ultimately apoptosis
