caption: Recruitment of Atg9 vesicles to the PAS by the Atg13 HORMA domain. (A) Two
  distinct regions of Atg13 play two crucial roles at the initiation of autophagosome
  formation. In the first step in PAS formation, Atg13 is dephosphorylated rapidly
  in response to starvation, promoting the interaction with Atg1 and Atg17 and leading
  to the formation of the PAS scaffold via the C-terminal disordered region. (The
  N-terminal HORMA domain is not required for this step.) In the second step, Atg13
  interacts with Atg9 via its N-terminal HORMA domain to recruit Atg9 vesicles to
  the PAS. (B) Atg9 vesicle recruitment is mediated by two different molecules depending
  on nutrient conditions. Under nutrient-rich conditions, Atg11 recruits Atg9 vesicles
  for the Cvt pathway. Under starvation conditions, Atg9 vesicles are recruited to
  the PAS via the interaction with the Atg13 HORMA domain.
