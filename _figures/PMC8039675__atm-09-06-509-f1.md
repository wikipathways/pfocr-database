caption: Cellular responses to α7nAChR activation. The activation of α7nAChR can lead
  to calcium influx directly, which can trigger neurotransmitter release, action potentials,
  synaptic plasticity, and calcium-induced calcium release. It can also activate the
  JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway and further induce anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory
  effects. In addition, it also activates the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway and induces
  autophagy. α7nAChR, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
