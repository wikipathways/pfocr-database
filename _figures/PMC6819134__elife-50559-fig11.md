caption: (Left) Around 20 neurons distributed in the brain and the ventral nerve cord
  (VNC) express immune genes such as PGRP-LB (called pLB1+ neurons, labeled in green
  and red). Among them, very few are also expressing the enzyme Tdc2 indicating that
  they are octopaminergic neurons (labeled in red), with the most robust pLB1 expression
  for those localized in the brain ventral midline, the VM cluster (delineated by
  the box with dashed line and schematically magnified in the top box). In homeostasic
  conditions, mated females produce mature oocytes surrounded by follicular cells.
  Rupture of these follicular cells (trimming) leads to egg ovulation. (Right) Upon
  bacterial infection either systemic or enteric, cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN) is
  released by proliferating bacteria and transported into the hemolymph. Intracytosolic
  peptidoglycan sensing via the PGRP-LE Rc, in the very few brain pLB1+/Tdc2+ neurons
  (but not in the VNC pLB1+/Tdc2+ neurons), leads to cell-autonomous NF-κB pathway
  activation. This causes a reduction of follicular cells trimming in mature (stage
  14) oocytes, hence a reduction of egg-laying in infected females. Since some pLB1+/Tdc2+
  neurons of the VM cluster (VM III sub-cluster specifically) are sending descending
  projections toward the VNC and that the direct addition of peptidoglycan reduces
  their intracytosolic calcium level, we believe that peptidoglycan directly reduces
  the activity of these cells. Then, these brain pLB1+/Tdc2+ cells could mediate their
  effect via secondary neurons present in the VNC. It remains to be understood how
  PGN from the hemolymph is reaching brain neurons, how PGN stimulation reduces calcium
  levels, how this is linked to NF-κB pathway signaling and whether secondary neurons
  modulate ovulation. Moreover, we believe that pLB1+/Tdc2- neurons control other
  behaviors that are probably modulated by infection.
