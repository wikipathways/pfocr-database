caption: Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and gene expression identified through RNA-seq.
  Major metabolic intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway are presented
  along with reaction facilitating enzymes in boxes. RNA-seq results of the Log2(fold
  change) for SBM compared to FM for enzymes that were found to be significantly different
  are provided. Color scale bar describes the various colors presented in the pathway.
