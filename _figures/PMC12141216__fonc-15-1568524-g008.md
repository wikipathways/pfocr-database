caption: Leptin in OB EVs modulates migration, invasion, clonogenicity, and metabolism
  of MDA-MB-231 cells. (A) Leptin within OB EVs interacts with its receptor (Ob-R)
  on MDA-MB-231 cells, initiating a cascade of cellular events that significantly
  enhance cell migration in a fatty acid oxidation (FAO)-dependent manner, likely
  through activation of the AKT signaling pathway. This interaction also promotes
  clonogenicity and activates STAT3, a key regulator of oncogenic processes, while
  increasing the invasive potential of the cells, likely through elevated MMP-9 activity.
  MMP-9, which is upregulated in EVs released by MDA-MB-231 cells, may be driven by
  STAT3 activation, further enhancing cancer cell aggressiveness. Additionally, leptin
  in OB EVs alters mitochondrial dynamics by increasing DNM1-L and OPA-1, redistributing
  mitochondria toward membrane protrusions, and preventing early apoptosis. (B) In
  addition to its impact on cell motility and survival, leptin in OB EVs induces metabolic
  shifts in MDA-MB-231 cells. These changes include enhanced G6PDH activity in the
  pentose phosphate pathway, reduced lactate accumulation, and decreased PK activity.
