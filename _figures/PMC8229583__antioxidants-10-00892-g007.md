caption: The graphical representation of the neuroprotective mechanism of estradiol
  against glutamate-induced neurodegeneration in developing rat brain. Exogenous glutamate
  (single subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg) treatment increased brain oxidative
  stress associated with the dysregulated MAP kinase pathway mediated neuroinflammation,
  synapse loss and neurodegeneration in postnatal 7-day rat brain. Co-administration
  of 17β-estradiol with glutamate alleviated glutamate-induced neurodegeneration in
  the developing rats.
