caption: Molecules associated with the canonical pathway (CP) ERK/MAPK signaling in
  the function of two stages of oocyte development. The Ingenuity Knowledge Base defines
  both CPs. (a) The relationship between MAPKs, RAS, and Hsp27 with oocyte maturation
  in ERK/MAPK signaling. (b) The relationship between MAPKs with the expansion of
  the cumulus–oocyte complex in ERK/MAPK signaling. The proteins highlighted with
  shadowed blocks are identified in three biological samples of canine in vitro oviductal
  cell-derived extracellular vesicles. The solid gray lines represent the genes associated
  with a CP. The arrows represent the directionality of the interaction between molecules
  or a molecule and a bio-function. The solid line is for direct interaction, and
  the dashed line is for indirect interaction.
