caption: 'Representation of the mechanism of action of zonulin. A. During the resting
  state, both homophilic and heterophilic protein-protein interactions keep the tight
  junction (TJ) proteins in a closed and competent state, as depicted in the freeze
  fracture electron microscopy photograph. B. Following zonulin pathway activation:
  Zonulin transactivates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through protease
  activated receptor 2 (PAR2) (1). The protein then activates phospholipase C (2)
  that hydrolyzes phosphatidyl inositol (PPI) (3) to release inositol 1,4,5-tris phosphate
  (IP-3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) (4). Protein kinase C alpha (PKC-α) is then activated
  (5), either directly (via DAG) (4) or through the release of intracellular Ca+ (via
  IP-3) (4a). Membrane-associated, activated PKC-α (6) catalyzes the phosphorylation
  of target protein(s), including zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) and myosin 1C, as
  well as the polymerization of soluble G-actin in F-actin (7). The combination of
  TJ protein phosphorylation and actin polymerization causes the rearrangement of
  the filaments of actin and leads to the subsequent displacement of proteins (including
  ZO-1) from the junctional complex (8). As a result, the intestinal TJ becomes looser
  (see freeze fracture electron microscopy). Once the zonulin signaling is over, the
  TJ again closes and resumes baseline steady state. Figure reprinted from Clinical
