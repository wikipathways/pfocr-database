caption: Smad-dependent and Smad-independent TGFβ signaling in EndoMT. In the Smad-dependent
  signaling pathway, TGFβ binds to TGFβ receptor 1 or TGFβ receptor 2 on the cell
  membrane, promoting the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Smad4 then forms a complex
  with phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3, which is translocated into the nucleus, leading
  to the expression of EndoMT-related transcription factors and promoting the occurrence
  of EndoMT. In the Smad-independent signaling pathway, after TGFβ binds to its receptors,
  downstream signaling pathways such as PI3K, RAS, and MAPK are activated, resulting
  in the downregulation of endothelial-specific gene transcription and the upregulation
  of mesenchymal-specific gene expression, thereby promoting the occurrence of EndoMT
