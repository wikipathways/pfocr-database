caption: Mechanisms by which HER3 contributes to resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy.
  (a) The oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase MET could phosphorylate HER3, leading
  to activation of the PI3 K/Akt pathway independent of EGFR kinase activity []. (b)
  Lengthy exposure of cancer cells to TKIs can lead to Akt downregulation which consequently
  increases HER3 translocation from the cytoplasm to the membrane through a feedback
  regulation. The phosphorylation of HER3 recruits PI3 K and further activates the
  PI3 K/Akt pathway which plays an important role in resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy
  [].
