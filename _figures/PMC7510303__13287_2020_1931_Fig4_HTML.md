caption: Diseases and regulator effects networks associated with the differentially
  expressed peptide precursors. Functional proteins related to a developmental disorder
  and b inflammatory response. Regulator effects network related to c cellular development,
  embryonic development, and organismal development and d organismal injury and abnormalities.
  Precursor proteins, diseases, and functions are shown as nodes, and the biological
  relationships between nodes are represented as lines with arrows. All lines are
  supported by at least one literature reference from the ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA) analysis. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of upregulation
  (red) or downregulation (green)
