caption: Cell-adhesion-dependent β-catenin signalling. We propose that the state of
  adhesion controls specific phosphorylation reactions. The simplest mechanism could
  involve increased/decreased accessibility to kinases and phosphatases depending
  on the degree of cadherin clustering. Under conditions of strong adhesion, β-catenin
  is stable—it is protected within the cadherin complex, both by the tight clustering
  of the cadherins, and by the recruitment of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) and actin
  filaments. When adhesion is loose or absent, cadherins are de-clustered and connections
  with the cytoskeleton are dissolved. The cadherin–β-catenin bond is then exposed
  to various regulators. Both cadherin and β-catenin undergo multiple modifications,
  in particular serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation (pS and pY). Cadherin
  serine/threonine phosphorylation tends to stabilize its interaction with β-catenin,
  whilst phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues destabilizes it []. Phosphorylation
  of β-catenin decreases its interaction with α-catenin, and perhaps also with cadherins
  []. Note that multiple regulators, including kinases and phosphatases, can directly
  associate with cadherin and β-catenin []. Endocytosis of the cadherin complex (not
  represented) is probably also implicated in β-catenin signalling []. The pool of
  β-catenin released from the cadherin complex could be biochemically marked by intramolecular
  interaction [], phosphorylation and interaction with other components. This activated
  β-catenin would signal more efficiently, either due to protection from degradation
  and rebinding to cadherins, increased nuclear transport, stronger binding to TCF
  or higher transactivation capabilities.
