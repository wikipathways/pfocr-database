caption: 'The "hit and run" mechanism posits a potential role for H. pylori in gastric
  carcinogenesis. The virulence factor VacA is internalized upon binding to cell surface
  receptors on host cells. This interaction initiates cell vacuolation and the subsequent
  release of cytochrome c from mitochondria within the cells, ultimately leading to
  cytotoxicity and cell death. The virulence factor CagA is translocated into the
  host cell through the T4SS. CagA drives cell hyperproliferation through three key
  mechanisms: It is phosphorylated by Src kinase, leading to the activation of mitogenic
  signaling pathways. CagA triggers the activation of c-Met and initiates the PI3K/Akt
  signaling cascade. CagA interacts with E-cadherin, disrupting the E-cadherin/β-catenin
  complex, thereby activating the Wnt signaling pathway. These pathways converge to
  induce the accumulation of β-catenin, which in turn may facilitate the overexpression
  of pro-oncogenic genes. The inhibition of PAR1b by CagA induces BRCAness, leading
  to double-strand breaks in the host cell. And CagL induces the separation of ADAM17
  from α5β1 integrins, which subsequently mediates the inhibition of H, K-ATPase expression
  through NF-κB inhibitory binding, resulting in hyposecretion of gastric acid. This
  hypochlorhydria triggers gastric dysbiosis. The genetic instability and dysbiosis
  may replace H. pylori in maintaining subsequent tumor phenotype and promoting tumor
  progression'
