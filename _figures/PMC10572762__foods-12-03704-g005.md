caption: Partial glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway map; red dots represent a relative
  increase in the content of metabolites, while blue dots represent a relative decrease
  in the content of metabolites; the upper arrow represents the increase of the metabolite,
  the lower arrow represents the decrease of the metabolite, and the flat arrow represents
  no significant change.
