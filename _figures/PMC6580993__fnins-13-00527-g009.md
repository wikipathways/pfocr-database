caption: 'Simplified signaling pathway: this simplified signaling cartoon encompasses
  all significant molecular changes detected in this study in spleen, hippocampus,
  and plasma after PEA treatment (PEA/sal). Decreased molecular levels compared to
  Sal are displayed in red while increased ones in green, respectively. Where lipid
  level alteration where restricted to a time point, they were specified in red color.
  The proposed pathways are inferred from published studies that show correlations
  between the targeted molecules under defined physiological or pathophysiological
  contexts. This graphic gives also an idea how the PEA-derived splenic molecular
  phenotype leads to a general state of decreased acute inflammation and increased
  resolution of inflammation and cell survival/growth. Similarly, possible interrelation
  between the transcriptional changes (mRNA) by PEA is depicted.'
