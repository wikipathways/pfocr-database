caption: The final two steps in the biosynthetic pathway of CoA. CoA biosynthesis
  occurs in a series of five steps that utilize pantothenate (vitamin B5), cysteine,
  and ATP. PPAT catalyzes the penultimate step, the reversible transfer of an adenylyl
  group from ATP to 4′-phosphopantetheine to form dPCoA and pyrophosphate. Subsequent
  phosphorylation at the 3′-hydroxyl of the ribose ring by dPCoA kinase produces the
  acyl group carrier, CoA. For CoA, the 3′-phosphate ADP is shown by a dashed box,
  the pantothenic acid group of pantetheine is outlined by the solid box, and the
  β-mercaptoethylamine of pantetheine is not boxed.
