caption: Schematic model representing the functional relationship between Slug, Mdm2,
  p53 and p21. Slug increased cellular levels of Mdm2 mRNA and protein. As Mdm2 could
  stabilize Slug mRNA by binding to it, an amplification loop between Slug and Mdm2
  expression appeared to exist (indicated by two-headed arrow). Mdm2 could act on
  p53 and p21, inducing their degradation. While Mdm2 was not required p53 for p21
  degradation, its action on p53 required p21 since the p53/p21 interaction promoted
  the p53/Mdm2 interaction. This oncogenic situation is indicated by red arrows. Mdm2
  could also induce proteolytic cleavage of Slug, which was facilitated by the p53/p21
  complex. This tumor-suppressing pathway is indicated by black arrows. This model
  suggested that Mdm2 could exert dual functions by mediating either the tumor-promoting
  function of Slug or tumor-suppressing function of the p53/p21 complex; the balance
  between these two opposing pathways may change depending on the external environment
  and internal physiology of cells. Slug, zinc finger protein SNAI2.
