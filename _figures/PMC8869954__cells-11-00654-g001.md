caption: Overview of RKIP-mediated functions induced by inhibition of RAF1, GRK2 and
  other kinases. RKIP-mediated kinase inhibition leads to signal inhibition and signal
  sensitisation. Kinase inhibition by RKIP (RAF1 kinase inhibitor protein) leads to
  inhibition of the RAF1-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway and NFKB, NOTCH1 and STAT3 pathways.
  By inhibition of P38 (MAPK14), RKIP enhances GSK3B activity, and RKIP-mediated inhibition
  of GRK2 sensitises signalling stimulated by G protein-coupled receptors, GPCRs (NIK,
  NF-kappa beta-inducing kinase; IKKA and IKKB, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa
  B kinase subunit alpha and beta; TAK1, transforming growth factor-beta-activated
  kinase 1; JAK1/2, Janus kinase 1 and 2; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of
  transcription 3; GSK3B, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; MAPK14, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase 14, P38 MAP kinase; GRK2, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2).
