caption: Myb directs a program in an “intermediate progenitor” P63− cell that is required
  to permit a cell to differentiate toward one of multiple cell lineages (ciliated,
  secretory, mucous) under the proper direction of Notch signaling and specific growth
  factors. A facultative secretory cell may use an independent pathway that is also
  reliant on Myb.
