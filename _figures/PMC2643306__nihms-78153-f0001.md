caption: The figure shows a scheme of the hepatic methionine cycle and some of the
  related pathways mentioned in this review. Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine
  (AdoMet) by methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT; EC 2.5.1.6); this compound can
  be used by a multitude of enzymes such as methyltransferases (MTases; EC 2.1.1.X),
  SAM radical proteins (EC 2.8.1.6 for biotin synthesis) and AdoMet decarboxylase
  (AdoMetDC; EC 4.1.1.50). Polyamine synthesis occurs with methylthioadenosine (MTA)
  production, a compound that can be reused for methionine synthesis by the methionine
  salvage pathway. On the other hand, the action of MTases renders methylated products
  and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) that can be hydrolyzed by AdoHcy hydrolase (SAHH,
  EC 3.3.1.1) to adenosine and homocysteine (Hcy). This reaction is reversible and
  favors AdoHcy synthesis. Hcy can be metabolized through the trans-sulfuration pathway
  by the consecutive action of cystathionine β synthase (CBS; EC 4.2.1.22) and cystathionine
  γ lyase (CγL; EC 4.4.1.1) rendering cysteine for glutathione synthesis, among other
  purposes. In addition, Hcy can also serve in resynthesis of methionine by two reactions
  catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS; EC 2.1.1.13) and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT; EC 2.1.1.5). Some of these steps can be modulated by metabolites synthesized
  in these pathways and dashed lines indicate the most relevant.
