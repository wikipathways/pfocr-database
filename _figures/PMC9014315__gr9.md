caption: Schematic illustration of signal transduction pathways involved in metastasis
  cascade. If normal epithelial cells (orange) detach from the membrane, it undergoes
  apoptosis, known as anoikis (brown), while the tumor cells (red) resist apoptosis
  through the activation of anti-apoptotic pathways such as PI3-AKT, MAPK (anti-apoptotic
  pathways). With the loss of E-cadherin receptors (promoted by TGF-β pathway), the
  tumor cells undergo a transition from non-mobile (epithelial) to mobile (mesenchymal)
  form (red tumor cell with a tail). These mobile or transformed tumor cells intravasate
  into blood vessels and transported to a new site, where they extravasate and localize
  (brain shown in blue). At the new site, tumor cells proliferate through the activation
  of Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, and other related pathways to develop a new tumor (metastasis).
  New blood vessels are formed (angiogenesis) by synthesizing angiogenic factors by
  Nf- kappa B and other signaling pathways. The new blood vessels are employed for
  the tumor cells' nutrition and transport (intravasation and extravasation). (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
