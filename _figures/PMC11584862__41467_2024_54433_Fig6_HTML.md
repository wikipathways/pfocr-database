caption: In the canonical TGFβ signaling pathway, TGFβ ligands bind to TGFβ receptors.
  Type II receptors phosphorylate and activate Type I receptors, which then phosphorylate
  Smad2/3. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 form a trimer either with or without Smad4, and
  transfer into nucleus. First, Smad2/3 play a dominant role in orchestrating the
  transition from the naïve mESC to the primed epiblast stage by inducing Dnmt3b.
  On one hand, Dnmt3b establishes DNA methylation patterns and ensures the timely
  downregulation of pluripotent factors like Sox2 by methylating its DNA at DMRs.
  On the other hand, Dnmt3b interacts with Smad2/3 to facilitate their binding to
  the hypomethylated centers of promoters and enhancers of epiblast genes, likely
  relying on H3K36me2/3. Second, Smad2/3-Smad4 complex plays a key role during the
  mesendoderm differentiation from the primed EpiLCs, in which Dnmt3b is downregulated
  and becomes less actively involved. The Smad2/3-Smad4 complex binds to the promoters
  and enhancers of mesendoderm genes, with the prebound pioneer factor Foxh162
