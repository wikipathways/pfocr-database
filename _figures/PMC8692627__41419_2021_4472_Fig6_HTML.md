caption: A (a, b) ts-112 and 5’-SHOT-RNAs can promote breast cancer proliferation;
  c tRFs are able to compete with oncogene transcripts to bind YBX1, suppressing oncogene
  expression and inhibiting breast cancer progression; d tRF3E inhibits breast cancer
  progression by binding NCL and disrupting the inhibitory effect of NCL on p53 mRNA;
  e 5’-tiRNA-Val depresses the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by targeting FZD3 to
  inhibit breast cancer progression; f tRF-Lys-CTT-010 promotes breast cancer cell
  proliferation by modulating the glucose metabolic pathway. B Hypoxia-induced 5’tiRNA-His-GTG
  targets LATS2, dysregulating the Hippo pathway and promoting the progression of
  colorectal cancer; tRF/miR-1280 inhibits colorectal cancer growth and metastasis
  by targeting the 3’UTR of the Notch ligand, JAG2 mRNA. Hypoxia-induced tRF-20-M0NK5Y93
  inhibits the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecule Claudin-1,
  and then suppresses colorectal cancer cell metastasis; Meanwhile, Dicer1-dependent
  expression of tRF-20-MEJB5Y13 was upregulated in response to hypoxic stimulation,
  leading to colorectal cancer migration and invasion. C CU1276 inhibits RAP1 to suppress
  lymphoma proliferation and to regulate DNA damage-induced molecular responses such
  as DNA replication; Lactate-induced 5’tiRNA binds AGO2 to maintain its stability.
  Accumulated 5’tiRNA competes with miR-20 to bind the AGO2 protein, resulting in
  increased expressions of the miR-20 target genes, SFMBT1 and MAP3K7, thereby promoting
  lymphoma proliferation.
