caption: The binding of S100A8/A9 to toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 triggers the MyD88-dependent
  pathway, appearing to play a vital role in inflammation. MyD88 recruits and activates
  IRAKs and TRAF6, which activates TAK1 via a TAB-mediated method. The activation
  of TAK1 facilitates the phosphorylation and activation of IKK and MAPK. Activated
  IKK phosphorylates and ubiquitinates I-κB, resulting in the liberation of NF-κB
  from inhibition. NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines. MAPKs, including p38, JNK, and ERK, have been demonstrated
  to activate c-Jun and c-fos, which translocate to the nucleus and form heterodimer
  AP-1, another transcription factor. Moreover, MAPK pathways are also involved in
  S100A8/A9-induced NF-κB activation during inflammation. The upregulated expression
  of pro-inflammatory genes amplifies the inflammatory response and severely destructs
  tissues in inflammation-associated diseases.
