caption: 'Receptor-mediated innate immunity against geminiviruses and counterdefensive
  viral activities: Like any other plant virus, geminiviruses are obligate intracellular
  parasites delivered into the cytoplasm of plant cells by the insect vector. The
  viral particle unpacking is likely to occur in the cytoplasm. Then, viral (v) CP-bound
  ssDNA is directed to the nucleus where v-ssDNA is converted to v-dsDNA to replicate
  the viral genome via the rolling circle mechanism and for transcribing the viral
  genes. The geminivirus infection both induces and suppresses the plant innate immunity.
  Geminivirus-derived nucleic acids may act as a viral PAMP to induce the dimerization
  of a yet-to-be-identified PRR with its coreceptor SERK1 to initiate the PTI signaling
  pathway. SERK1 has been shown to be required for viral PTI elicited by dsRNA, but
  no direct evidence exists for its participation in geminiviral PTI. FLS2 may function
  as a geminiviral PRR because C4 acts as a virulence effector by binding to FLS2
  and inhibiting early PTI responses. Likewise, the betasatellite βC1 virulence effector
  affects the MAPKinase cascade. In a resistant Phaseolus vulgaris genotype to bean
  dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV), NSP acts as an avirulence factor; it is recognized by
  an unknown intracellular receptor and activates HR, cell death, and ETI-like responses.
  A typical NLR intracellular receptor of ETI (TYNBS1) confers resistance to TYLCV,
  yet the cognate geminivirus avirulence factor is unknown. Rep has been shown to
  induce ROS and SA-mediated defenses. As virulence effectors, C4 and C2 counter ETI
  activation by suppressing HR and cell death. C4 also inhibits SA-mediated defenses.
  The question marks indicate either events not well clarified or unknown. Solid line
  arrows describe experimentally demonstrated events and dotted line arrows denote
  genetically implicated events. See  for the designations of the viral proteins.
