caption: Schematically illustrated representative pathway maps, ‘E-cadherin signaling
  and its regulation in gastric cancer (FDR = 0.004 and P < 0.001)’ (A) and ‘Development_Regulation
  of EMT (FDR = 0.002 and P < 0.001)’ (B), in which epigenomically and genomically
  affected genes were accumulated in Cluster B1, by MetaCore software. Original pathway
  maps generated by MetaCore software have been simplified by eliminating items that
  were not correlated with genes affected epigenetically and/or genetically in our
  Cluster B1. Genes showing DNA methylation alterations and those showing genetic
  aberrations (SNVs, insertions/deletions and/or copy number aberrations) are indicated
  in red and blue, respectively.
