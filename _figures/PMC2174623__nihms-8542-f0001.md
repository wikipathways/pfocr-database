caption: 'GHB synthesis and metabolism. Schematic diagram of the pathways responsible
  for the synthesis and metabolism of GHB (the enzymes involved are indicated by numbers,
  see below). GHB activates GHB receptors, but also GABAB receptors as a weak agonist.
  Because GHB can be converted to GABA, some of the GABAB receptor-mediated actions
  of GHB could be elicited by the GHB-derived GABA pool interacting with GABAB receptors.
  1: alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; 2: -oxidation pathway;
  3: NADPH-dependent cytoplasmic aldehyde reductase, ALR-1; 4: mitochondrial pyridine
  nucleotide-independent oxido-reductase; 5: NADPH-dependent cytoplasmic aldehyde
  reductase, ALR-2; 6: specific succinic semialdehyde reductase; 7: γ-aminobutyric
  acid transaminase; 8, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase; TCA: tricarboxylic acid.'
