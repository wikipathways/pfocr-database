caption: The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Off-state; in the absence of a Wnt ligand,
  β-catenin is bound in a multiprotein degradation complex containing the scaffold
  protein Axin, the tumour suppressor gene product APC, as well as the kinases CKI
  and GSK-3β, among others. Upon phosphorylation, β-catenin is ubiquitinated by the
  β-TrCP–E3-ligase complex and subsequently degraded by the proteasomes. On-state;
  Wnt ligand associates with FZD and LRP-5/6 co-receptors. This leads to the translocation
  of Axin to the plasma membrane through direct interaction with LRP-5/6 and Dsh/FZD.
  β-catenin is released from the multiprotein complex, accumulates in the cytoplasm
  in a non-phosphorylated form, and subsequently translocates into the nucleus where
  it promotes transcription of Wnt target genes upon binding to TCF/LEF.
