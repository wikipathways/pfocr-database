caption: Summary of the PKCγ calcium-signaling pathway. Ligand binding to the mGluR1
  receptor is followed by PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP2 into the second messenger
  IP3 and DAG. Binding of IP3 to the IP3R1 and induces Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the cytoplasm. This step is controlled by CAR8 which can inhibit binding
  of IP3 to the IP3R1. Simultaneous binding of Ca2+ to the C2 domain and of DAG to
  the C1 domain induce translocation of PKCγ to the plasma membrane. There, the pseudosubstrate
  is released from the kinase domain, allowing phosphorylation of downstream target
  proteins. PKC exerts an inhibitory effect on TRPC3 channel activity directly through
  phosphorylation or indirectly. A rise of the intracellular calcium concentration
  can also be mediated by the voltage-gated Ca2+-channel Cav2.1 or TRPC3. Conversely,
  PMCA2 can efficiently remove Ca2+ from the cytoplasm.
