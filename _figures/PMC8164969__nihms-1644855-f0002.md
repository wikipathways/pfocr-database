caption: As tissue iron levels increase, iron is captured by unknown receptor(s) on
  the surface of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), leading to the stabilization
  and translocation of NRF2 into the nucleus to induce BMP6 expression. BMP2 expression
  is also increased by unknown mechanisms. BMP6 and BMP2, most likely in the form
  of heterodimers (BMP2/6), bind to BMP type I (ALK2 and ALK3) and type II receptors
  (ACTR2A and BMPR2) and the co-receptor HJV to phosphorylate SMAD1/5/8, which together
  with SMAD4 activates the transcription of hepcidin. As serum iron levels increase,
  holo-transferrin (TF-2Fe) is captured by TFR1 and TFR2 on the surface of hepatocytes.
  It is postulated that HFE dissociates from TFR1 and forms a complex with TFR2 and
  HJV, which activates hepcidin via an interaction with the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway.
  Neogenin (NEO) stabilizes HJV and the BMP receptor complex. In the setting of iron
  deficiency, TMPRSS6 cleaves HJV from the membrane surface to inhibit hepcidin production.
  Soluble HJV may also contribute to hepcidin suppression by sequestering BMP2/6 ligands.
  Under erythropoietic conditions, ERFE is secreted by red blood cell precursors and
  blocks BMP2/6 from binding to the BMP receptor complex, resulting in hepcidin downregulation.
  Under inflammatory conditions, macrophages release IL-6 and increase hepcidin transcription
  via the JAK-STAT3 pathway.
