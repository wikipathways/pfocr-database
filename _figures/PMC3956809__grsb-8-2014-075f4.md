caption: Tissue-specific expression within individual functions—a case of insulin
  signaling pathway. The left subfigure shows an abstract of the insulin signaling
  pathway where expressed genes in liver and muscle and their corresponding downstream
  affected functions are included. The right panel displays the tissue-specific regulation
  of genes within the same functional category; putative TFs are those significantly
  overrepresented on the promoters of corresponding genes.
