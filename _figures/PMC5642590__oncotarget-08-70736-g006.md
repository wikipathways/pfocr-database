caption: Cell growth and survival of the parental drug-sensitive cell harboring activated
  mutant EGFR depends upon an amplified activated EGFR-driven PI3K/AKT pathway that
  is highly susceptible to afatinib. In contrast, in afatinib drug-resistant cells,
  expression of the activated mutant EGFR is markedly reduced because of the loss
  of EGFR gene amplification. Conversely, SFK/FAK activation contributes to growth,
  survival, and migration of afatinib-resistant cells.
