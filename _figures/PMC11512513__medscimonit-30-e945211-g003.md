caption: In cardiac cachexia, muscle wasting is driven by disruptions in the anabolic-catabolic
  balance. (1) During anabolic phases, IGF1 binds to the both the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R)
  and the insulin receptor (IR), leading to the phosphorylation of insulin receptor
  substrate 1 (IRS1) and activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway, which
  promotes protein synthesis. However, this anabolic signaling is often impaired in
  CHF. (2) During catabolic phases, myostatin, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
  TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6, Ang-II, and glucocorticoids bind to their respective receptors
  and initiate the transcription of atrophy-related genes Trim63 and Fbxo32 via the
  NF-κB, Foxo, and SMAD signaling pathways. This results in increased expression of
  E3 ubiquitin ligases, MuRF1, and MAFbx/atrogin-1, leading to protein degradation
  through UPS activation. Created with Microsoft® Excel® 2021MSO (version 2407 Build
