caption: CRHR1 alterations in CRPS patients and schematic representation of miR-34a
  mediated repression of CRHR1 regulating POMC expression and BMI a CRHR1 was significantly
  higher in poor responders than in responders. Relative expression of CRHR1 mRNA
  in blood from responders (n = 8) and poor responders (n = 7) to ketamine treatment.
  Data were normalized to 18S. *p < 0.05. Unpaired t-test was used for statistical
  analysis. Data represent mean ± SEM. b Grouping of CRPS patients based on miR-34a
  expression, BMI and response to ketamine. miR-34a may influence BMI by regulating
  CRHR1/POMC pathway
