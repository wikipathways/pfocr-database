caption: Mapping of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with kojR expression
  to A. oryzae carbon metabolic pathway. Red, DEG whose expression levels in A. oryzae
  RIB40 are higher than that in ΔkojR strain; blue, DEG with lower expression levels
  in A. oryzae RIB40 than that in ΔkojR strain. A metabolic map was created using
  the PathVisio software (Ver. 3.3.0) [25] based on the carbon metabolism (aor01200)
  and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (aor00010) of A. oryzae in KEGG [24]
