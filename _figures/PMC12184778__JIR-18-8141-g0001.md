caption: Gut microbiota/REV-ERBα/NF-κB axis. Derivatives (such as LPS) and metabolites
  (such as SCFAs) of the gut microbiota influence the NF-κB signaling pathway by modulating
  the priming and activation steps of the NLRP3 inflammasome. On one hand, after LPS
  is recognized and bound by TLR4, IKKα, IKKβ, and NEMO are activated within the cell
  under the induction of TRIF. This leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation
  of IκBα. NF-κB itself and its p65/RelA subunit then translocate to the nucleus,
  where they participate in the synthesis of the NLRP3 inflammasome and various inflammatory
  factors. On the other hand, SCFAs enter cells via GPR43. Butyrate inhibits the phosphorylation
  and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, thereby blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway.
  In contrast, acetate induces the production of ROS, which promotes the activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The transcription and expression of Platr4 and NFIL3
  oscillate diurnally under the regulation of REV-ERBα, thereby influencing the NF-κB
  signaling pathway. The former inhibits the transcription of NLRP3 inflammasome components
  to prevent the release of inflammatory factors, while the latter enhances the activity
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting the transcription of IκBα
