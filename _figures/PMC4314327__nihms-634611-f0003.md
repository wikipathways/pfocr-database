caption: (a) Activation of PRRs by M.tb and/or M.tb cell wall components, and downstream
  responses. TLR activation by M.tb cell wall components 38 kDa glycoprotein, LpqH,
  or PIMs promote inflammation; in contrast, LprA, LprG, PhoS1, LM and LAM increase
  the expression of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10, IL-4 and TGF-β which
  enhance M.tb growth. MR-mediated phagocytosis of M.tb or MR stimulation by ManLAM
  delays P-L fusion and enhances PPARγ expression, leading to increased M.tb growth.
  TDM binding to Mincle or ManLAM to Dectin II enhance TNF1, IL-12 and IL-6 leading
  to granuloma formation and M.tb control. (b) Negative regulators of macrophage responses
  to M.tb and/or cell wall components. M.tb or ManLAM stimulation enhances the expression
  of various negative regulators, e.g. IRAK-M, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, PPARγ, and TR4 as
  well as IL-10 and type I-IFNs which suppress host protective inflammatory mediators
  and promote M.tb growth. (c) Regulation of macrophage microRNAs and their functions
  in response to M.tb and/or cell wall components. miRNAs are important immune regulators
  during M.tb infection. Increased miR-125b targets TNFα for degradation, and miR-124
  and miR-147 target TLR pathway genes such as MyD88 and TRAF6, are highly induced
  by M.tb infection and promote M.tb growth. (d) Impact of macrophage lipid mediators
  in response to M.tb and/or cell wall components. Lipid metabolites such as PGE2,
  LXA4 and LTB4 also regulate the macrophage immune response during M.tb infection.
  PGE2 and LXA4 are anti-inflammatory and promote M.tb growth. In contrast, LTB4 enhances
  bacterial killing during the early stage of infection and later promotes M.tb growth.
