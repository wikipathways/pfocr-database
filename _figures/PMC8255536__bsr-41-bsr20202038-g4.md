caption: 'SMMSCs secrete many growth factors, such as TGFβ1, FGF18, and BMP2 whose
  concentrations increase with the IGF1 induction. These factors are contained in
  the SMMSCs-CM. IL1β induces chondrocyte inflammation and triggers OA involving two
  different pathways: the NFκB and P38-MAPK. During inflammation, the NFκB protein
  plays a role in decreasing in SOX9 gene expression. SMMSCs treatment up-regulate
  SOX9 expression mainly through TGFβ1 action via SMAD2/SMAD3 pathway. SOX9 acts as
  an activator of COL2 gene, and an inhibitor of COL10. During IL1β-induced inflammation
  of chondrocytes in which MMP13 and ADAMTS4 are up-regulated through P38/MAPK pathway.
  SMMSCs treatments act in alleviating the OA symptoms through: (1) BMP2 down-regulates
  COL10; (2) FGFs, mainly through FGF18 that acts by inhibiting MMP13 and ADAMTS4
  synthesis through P38/MAPK pathway. COL2 deposition results in healthy and elastic
  joint. Meanwhile, COL10 causes stiffness in the joint, which is one characteristic
  of OA.'
