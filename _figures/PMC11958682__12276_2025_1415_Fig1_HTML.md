caption: The significant shift in glucose metabolism within HCC cells, characterized
  by upregulated expression of key enzymes that enhance glucose uptake and utilization.
  These changes include increased levels of GLUT1 and HK2, which elevate glucose uptake;
  PKM2, which increases augments pyruvate formation; and LDH, which facilitates the
  conversion of pyruvate to lactate, supporting anaerobic glycolysis. The diagram
  also highlights the activation of the PPP, a crucial metabolic pathway that provides
  R5P for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH for lipid synthesis and antioxidant defense.
  In HCC, the PPP is often enhanced, as indicated by increased activity of enzymes
  such as G6PD and TKT. Enzymes with increased expression in HCC are marked in red,
  denoting their upregulation and pivotal roles in cancer metabolism
