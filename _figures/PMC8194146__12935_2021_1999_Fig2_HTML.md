caption: Illustration of the canonical Hippo pathway and its dysregulation. MST1/2
  and LATS1/2 are kinases. SAV1 (WW45) and MOB1A/B are adaptors. The phosphorylation
  cascade in the Hippo pathway can negatively regulate YAP/TAZ and inhibit the proliferation-promoting
  effects of YAP/TAZ. Dysregulation leads to proliferation, invasion, and migration
  of malignancies via the nuclear translocation of YAP and TAZ
