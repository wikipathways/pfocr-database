caption: 'Figure 2A. Predicting response to induction chemotherapy in AMLA. Modulators
  and networks assessed. Schematic of the cell signalling pathways probed using SCNP.
  Signalling node is defined as a combination of a specific proteomic read out in
  the presence or absence of a specific modulator. Text in blue indicates assay readouts.
  Biological categories of signalling pathways and nodes are indicated by colour:
  1) Chemokine, Cytokine, Growth factor Signal Induction (green), 2) Functional Apoptosis
  (pink), 3) Phosphatase Regulation/Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Stress(purple) and
  4) Surface Markers/Drug Transporters (orange).Figure 2B. Apoptosis pathway distinguishes
  CR in younger patients with AML. Functional apoptosis assays can stratify NR and
  CR responses in diagnostic AML leukemia samples. Shown in the side panel is a schema
  for functional apoptosis after DNA damage. In this example the modulator is etoposide
  and the readouts are cleaved PARP and p-Chk2. The upper left panel shows the AUC
  of the ROC (0.81) for the signalling node etoposide → p-Chk2, cleaved PARP+. The
  upper right panel shows the box and whisker plots with standard deviation shown.
  Circles represent individual patient samples percentage of PARP positive and p–Chk2
  negative cells. The frequency of p-CHK2-, Cleaved PARP+ (c-PARP+) apoptotic cells
  (upper left quadrant of the flow cytometry plots) after overnight exposure to Etoposide
  was used to quantify apoptosis.Figure 2C. Signalling nodes add value to age alone
  for induction response stratification. PMA induced p-CREB readout improves upon
  age as a classifier for response to induction therapy. Significant p-values (slope
  = 0) for the signalling node were found after accounting for age in the logistic
  regression model. The ROC plot illustrates CR and NR stratification using the model
  incorporating the signalling node (PMA → p-CREB) with age.'
