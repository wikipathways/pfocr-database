caption: Crosstalk between metabolism and prostate cancer genomics. The hexosamine
  pathway catalyses the conversion of glucose and glutamine to provide a metabolite
  UDP-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). The O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) facilitates the N-acetylglucosamination
  (GlcNAcylation) or Glycation process. In addition, the Krebs cycle fuels metabolites
  private and citrate, which gets converted by acyl-COA synthetase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.
  Products from fatty acid oxidation, fatty Acyl CoA, inhibit the activity of lysine
  acetyltransferases (KAT). KAT reactions also release CoA-SH, which acts as an inhibitor.
  B-Hydroxybutyrate, a ketone from FA, and lactate, a by-product of glycolysis, have
  been shown to inhibit lysine deacetylase (KDAC). Amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle
  fuels in methionine and ATP, respectively, and synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM). Histone methyl transferases and DNA methyl transferases catalyse SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), which in turn can inhibit DNMTs and HMTs. TCA cycle intermediates, succinate,
  fumarate, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) acts as inhibitors
  of TET demethylases and Jumonji-C (JMJC) domain-containing histone demethylases
  (JHDMs). The figure has been adapted and modified from the review ().
