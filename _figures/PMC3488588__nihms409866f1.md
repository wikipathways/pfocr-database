caption: '[1]De novo ceramide synthesis. Within the endoplasmic reticulum, serine
  and palmitoyl-CoA are condensed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) to form in
  the first step of the de novo sphingolipid synthesis. Subsequently, 3-ketosphinganine
  is metabolized to dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by (dihydro)ceramide
  synthase (CerS) producing dihydroceramide, which is then converted to ceramide by
  dihydroceramide desaturase (DES). Ceramide is then trafficked to the Golgi apparatus
  via vesicular transport or via the ceramide transfer protein (CERT) where it is
  the substrate for the synthesis of more complex sphingolipids, such as sphingomyelin
  and glycosphingolipids. [2] Sphingomyelinase pathway. The breakdown of sphingomyelin
  by aSMase within the endo-lysosomal system, at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane,
  and in association with lipoproteins. Ceramide generated from the breakdown of SM
  can be deacylated by acid or neutral ceramidases (aCDase, nCDase) to yield free
  sphingosine. Sphingosine can be the substrate for either CerS, via the [3] ceramide
  salvage pathway or sphingosine kinases (SphK) to form ceramide and S1P, respectively.
