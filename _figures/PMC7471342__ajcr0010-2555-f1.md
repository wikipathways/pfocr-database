caption: 'The top 25 mRNA-hub genes in baseline analysis. (A) mRNA hub gene network
  and (B) Venn diagram. Category 1, we divided BC patients into two groups with clinical
  integrity, clinical concordance versus discordance. Clinical concordance was defined
  as a group of patients who were pCR/not relapsed and non-pCR/relapsed, according
  to NAC. On the other hand, clinical discordance was defined as a group of patients
  who were pCR/relapsed and non-pCR/not relapsed, according to NAC. Category 2, we
  divided NAC treated BC patients according to whether they relapsed in the group
  having pCR. Two microarray data sets GSE32603 and GSE87455 were downloaded from
  the GEO database. The data were processed by unpaired t-test (P<0.05, |log2FC| >0.17).
  Abbreviations: BC, breast cancer; pCR, pathological complete response; NAC, neoadjuvant
  chemotherapy; GEO, Gene Expression Omnibus.'
papertitle: Transcriptomic and functional pathway features were associated with survival
  after pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.
