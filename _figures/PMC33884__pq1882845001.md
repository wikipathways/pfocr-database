caption: The NO-signaling pathway. NOSs convert L-arginine  to citrulline and a family
  of NO-related molecules. Exact N-oxide  yields and identities vary as a function
  of experimental condition. The  reaction requires cosubstrates/cofactors NADPH,
  O2, and  tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Glutathione (GSH) may sustain  enzyme activity
  and/or influence reaction product.  Superoxide/hydrogen peroxide  (O2−/H2O2) are  typically
  generated by NOS, at least to some degree. NOSs may be  regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin
  and other associated  proteins. NO-elicited signals are mediated by cGMP, nitrosylation,
  or  both. Although a growing list of signaling pathways are influenced by  NO, sites
  of regulation by NO and NO-dependent interactions between  signal transduction cascades
  are as yet poorly characterized. SNO,  S-nitrosothiol; NOx, other oxides of nitrogen,
  in this case perhaps  also including low mass metal-nitrosyl compounds.
