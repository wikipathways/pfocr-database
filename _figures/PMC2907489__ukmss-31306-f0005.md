caption: Model depicting how certain components of the DDR are often lost during the
  evolution of cancer. In the hypothetical situation shown, there are two DDR pathways
  “A” and “B” that are both able to promote cell survival in response to a particular
  form of DNA damage. While normal cells possess both pathways, pathway “B” is shown
  to be lost during tumourigenesis. Consequently, administration of a drug targeting
  pathway “A” would be expected to be much more cytotoxic to cancer cells than the
  normal cells, thus providing a potential therapeutic window for the use of this
  drug in treating a cancer patient.
