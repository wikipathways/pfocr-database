caption: 'Schematic representation of main interactions of TRPC5 channel with signaling
  proteins in a cellular context. The indirect mode of TRPC5 activation is mediated
  downstream of the Gq/11-protein coupled receptor activated phospholipase C (PLC)
  signaling pathway that leads to the cleavage of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers: diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol
  1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), all of which are implicated in the regulation of TRPC
  channel activation. IP3 binds to IP3 receptors (IP3R), resulting in Ca2+ release
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  is sufficient and necessary to activate TRPC5. DAG activates the channel under specific
  conditions. A prerequisite for DAG sensitivity of TRPC5 is a dissociation of the
  scaffolding NHERF protein (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor) from the PDZ-binding
  motif ”VTTRL” located right at the end of the C-terminus. This dissociation can
  be achieved in several ways: a phospho-null mutation of the former threonine from
  the “VTTRL” motif (T970), a charge-neutralizing mutation of the first PDZ domain
  of NHERF, inhibition of the protein kinase C (PKC), or the depletion of (PIP2).
  The PKC phosphorylation of T970 leads to TRPC5 desensitization, and PIP2 plays a
  role in maintaining PLC-independently evoked channel activity. Binding of Gαi3 subunit
  to the ankyrin repeat domain (IYY57-59 in the loop connecting ankyrin repeats 1
  and 2) increases the sensitivity of TRPC5 to PIP2. In analogy with TRPC4, calmodulin
  (CaM) can interact with the connecting (rib) helix of the channel and restrict the
  mobility of the TRP helix, thus locking the channel in the closed state at high
  Ca2+ cytosolic concentrations. TRPC5 can partially function as a store-operated
  channel by interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium sensor STIM1,
  the Stromal Interaction Molecule 1. After ER Ca2+ store depletion, STIM1 undergoes
  a conformational change and interacts with Orai1: STIM1 looses the Ca2+ bound to
  the N-terminal EF-hand domain (EFh) and undergoes from the tight state to the active,
  elongated state which allows it to interact with Orai1 (via the STIM1-Orai activating
  region; SOAR) and anionic phospholipids (via the lysine-rich region; K). This process
  is accompanied by oligomerization of STIM1 proteins to aggregates. Two positively
  charged lysines at the C-terminal end of STIM1 (in the K region) interact with two
  negative residues conserved among TRPC1/3/4/5/6 (D652 and E653 in TRPC5). TRPC is
  capable of interacting with SOAR and this interaction involves Y241, L244 and L255
  in the H5 helix (N-terminal helix-loop-helix region). Importantly, the clustering
  of STIM1 at ER-plasma membrane junctions can be also induced by an increase in temperature
  above 35 °C, without depleting Ca2+ stores, and this process is highly temperature
  dependent. All structures shown are taken from the PDB database or were predicted
  by AlphaFold Protein Structure Database'
