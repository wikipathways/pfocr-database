caption: A. BRAFV600E promotes tumor growth through hyperactivation of the MEK-ERK
  pathway. Treatment with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) such as PLX4032 blocks this signaling
  pathway, leading to tumor shrinkage. B. When cells bearing BRAFWT are treated with
  BRAF inhibitors, a BRAF/CRAF heterodimerization induces activation of the MEK-ERK
  pathway. This results in increased cell proliferation, which may contribute to the
  development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
