caption: The nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis pathway. The de novo
  NAD synthesis pathway generates NAD from the essential aromatic amino acid tryptophan.
  Nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) is converted to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide
  (NaAD) by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT). NaAD is then
  converted to NAD by NAD synthetase. There are three additional thee salvage pathways.
  Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) is produced by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT) from nicotinamide (NAM), and by nicotinamide riboside kinase (NRK) from
  nicotinamide riboside (NR). NMN is then converted to NAD by NMNAT. Alternatively,
  NAM is converted to nicotinic acid (NA) by nicotinamidase, and then NA is converted
  to NaMN by nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NaPRT). P7C3-A20 is reported
  to acts as a small-molecule activator of the enzyme NAMPT within the bioenergetic
  NAD synthesis pathway.
