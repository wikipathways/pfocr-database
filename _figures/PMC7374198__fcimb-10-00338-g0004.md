caption: A general overview of the lipid metabolism in Malassezia, based on lipidomic
  and in silico genomic analysis presented in  and . Malassezia species are lipid
  dependent due to the lack of fatty acid synthase (FAS1/FAS2). External sources of
  free fatty acids are taken up and activated by the acyl-CoA synthases FAA1/2/3/4.
  Δ9-desaturase (OLE1) catalyzing the conversion of saturated to unsaturated fatty
  acids was absent in M. globosa and M. restricta. The presence of phosphatidate phosphatase
  PAH1 can replace the lack of DPP1, LPP1, and APP1 to allow production of DAG from
  PA and to form TAG in lipid droplets. PA can normally be resynthesized from DAG
  by DGK1, but this gene was absent in all strains. Genes implicating in phospholipids
  synthesis involved CDP-DAG as a precursor were present in all strains. Importantly,
  in M. sympodialis, PIS1 involved in PI synthesis was absent as well as CHO2 and
  OPI3, which both are participating in the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
  pathway to form PC. GEP4 involved in PG synthesis was absent in M. pachydermatis,
  whereas this strain did contain CKI1 involved in PC synthesis but was absent in
  the other strains. ECI1 required to degrade unsaturated FAs was absent in all strains.
  Genes involved in sterol and sphingolipids synthesis were present in all strains,
  except ERG26 and YSR3, respectively, in M. pachydermatis, M. sympodialis, M. globosa,
  and M. restricta. Genes ERG27, ERG2, and ERG3 were only absent in M. sympodialis.
  ARE1/2 predicted to catalyze the acylation of ergosterol was absent in M. globosa.
