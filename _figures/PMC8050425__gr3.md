caption: Schematic representation of Jen1 endocytosis in response to distinct signals.
  (A) Glucose-induced downregulation of the monocarboxylate Jen1 transporter. In the
  presence of lactate, Jen1 is localized at the PM and Rod1/Art4 is inactive. Upon
  glucose addition, Glc7/Reg1 dephosphorylates Snf1 and Rod1. Rod1 is released from
  a phospho-dependent binding with 14–3-3 proteins and can, then, bind Rsp5. This
  results in Jen1 ubiquitylation, internalization and degradation via the MVB pathway
  , , . Ubp2 and Ubp15 seem to control Rod1 activity by managing the level of its
  ubiquitylation . (B) Alkali stress induced internalization of Jen1 transporter.
  In cells induced in lactate, for 4 h, Jen1 is localized at the PM. The prolonged
  growth (24 h) in lactate results in the alkalinization of the extracellular medium
  and leads to Jen1 internalization and degradation. This mechanism depends on an
  active Jen1 transporter and relies on TORC1 pathway. The model proposes that activated
  TORC1 leads to the inactivation of Npr1 kinase, and the activation of Sit4 phosphatase.
  This results in Bul1 activation and consequently Jen1 Rsp5-ubiquitylation and subsequent
  vacuolar degradation . PM, plasma membrane; Lac, lactate; Ub, ubiquitylation; P,
  phosphorylation; H+, proton. Dashed lines represent predicted regulation and signals
  (+) and (−) represent activation and inhibition, respectively.
