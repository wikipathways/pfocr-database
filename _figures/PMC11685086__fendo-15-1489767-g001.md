caption: FSH functions through the FSHR. In females, FSH plays a key role during ovarian
  folliculogenesis and antral follicle development and, in combination with luteinizing
  hormone (LH), stimulates preovulatory follicular growth (56–58). In males, FSH regulates
  the mitotic proliferation of Sertoli cells, supports their growth and maturation,
  and prompts the release of androgen-binding protein, which regulates the overall
  process of spermatogenesis (60). FSH acts on FSHRs on osteoclasts, stimulating NFκB,
  MEK/Erk, and AKT pathways, thus promoting osteoclast formation, function, and survival
  (63, 64). Functional FSHR is expressed on bone marrow very small embryonic-like
  stem cells (VSELs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in adult mice (65). PKA further
  phosphorylates a large number of cytokines and regulates cAMP-response element binding
  protein (CREB) transcription in the nucleus to control the expression of downstream
  effector genes, such as UPC1, aromatase, and inhibin-A (66). FSH interacts with
  FSHRs in HepG2 cells, reducing LDLR levels (67). Mature SREBP2 increases liver cholesterol
  synthesis by promoting transcription and expression of the cholesterol synthesizing
  and rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR)
  (68). The interaction of FSH with FSHR on monocytes has been shown to upregulate
  RANK expression and promote monocytic infiltration of atherosclerotic plaques (69).
  FSH may act by stimulating new vessel formation via FSHR present on vascular endothelial
  cells (70). FSH may elevate the production of cytokines, namely IL-6 and TNFα, from
  macrophages to cause low-grade inflammation, atherosclerosis development, and insulin
  resistance (71). FSH promotes the development of atherosclerosis by increasing VCAM-1
  protein expression via activating the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway (72)
