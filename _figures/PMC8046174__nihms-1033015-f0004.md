caption: Normal cells use nutrients such as glucose to run oxidative phosphorylation
  that efficiently produces energy (dotted grey line). In cancer cells, these nutrients
  are instead diverted into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway to produce sugar nucleotide
  monomers and enhance the production of glycocalyx polymers such as mucins and HA.
  Cancer cells also produce large amounts of lactic acid and H+ that must be pumped
  out of the cell to avoid toxicity. Supplementing glucose can greatly increase the
  amount of HA (stained red in the inset) on the cell surface (fluorescence images
  reproduced from ref. , American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology).
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
