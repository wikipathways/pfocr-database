caption: The balance between stress tolerance and productivity modes is reflected
  by the antagonistic action of ABA and CK signaling. Schematic representation of
  the working model demonstrating the regulatory role of CKs in promoting productivity
  under abiotic stress by inactivating SnRK2 the key component of ABA signaling pathway.
  Under stress conditions, CKs inactivate SnRK2 and inhibit ABA signaling pathway
  and the downstream upregulation of stress related genes and growth promotion via
  CK-responsive genes. The model suggests a molecular mechanism underlying the behavior
  of CK over-expressing transgenic plants under mild abiotic stress conditions for
  short periods. This model has been partially adapted from .
