caption: (A) Heterosynaptic inhibition of corticostriatal terminals. It has been shown
  that activation of D2 receptors at the presynaptic terminal of the incoming cortical
  projections inhibits corticostriatal glutamate release. Heterosynaptic inhibition
  is selective for the least active terminals, thereby filtering out less active inputs
  (). Because PET imaging does not have the resolution to determine which exact cells
  contribute to the elevated binding potential of D2 receptors in the striatum, D2
  receptors could be upregulated in the corticostriatal terminals. This in combination
  with increased dopamine release may lead to a hypereffective heterosynaptic inhibition
  that may prevent the transmission of important cognitive information from the cortex
  to the striatum.(B) Inhibition of medium spiny neurons of the direct pathway. Both
  D1 and D2 receptors are present on medium spiny neurons, which represent 95% of
  striatal neurons and are the main output neurons of the striatum. D1 receptors are
  preferentially present on medium spiny neurons that project directly to the substantia
  nigra pars reticularis and the internal segment of the globus pallidus. D1 receptor
  activation enhances excitability of these cells. In contrast, D2 receptors are preferentially
  expressed on medium spiny neurons that project indirectly to the substantia nigra
  pars reticularis and the internal segment of the globus pallidus. D2 receptor activation
  reduces excitability of these cells (). Upregulation of D2 receptors may therefore
  affect the balance between direct and indirect pathways and alter the striatal output
  of the incoming cortical information.(C) Global inhibition of medium spiny neurons.
  Activation of D2 receptors on the cholinergic interneurons diminishes acetylcholine
  release from these cells. The released acetylcholine affects glutamatergic and dopaminergic
  terminals. Acetylcholine generally enhances the glutamatergic excitation of medium
  spiny neurons (). Increased activation of D2 receptors on cholinergic interneurons
  may therefore globally reduce the excitability of the striatum. Although the mechanism
  for the reduced metabolic activity observed in patients with schizophrenia is unknown,
  reduced cholinergic activity could be a contributing factor. MSN, medium spiny neuron;
  ChAT, choline-acetyl-transferase as a marker for cholinergic interneurons; GLU,
  glutamate; DA, dopamine.
