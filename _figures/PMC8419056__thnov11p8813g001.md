caption: Morphological changes during pyroptotic cell death. The inflammasome is activated
  by PAMPs and DAMPs or chemotherapy, and this activation leads to the activation
  of caspase-1 or caspase-3, which eventually results in the cleavage of gasdermin
  D and gasdermin E to form N-terminal fragments, respectively. First, gasdermin-mediated
  pore formation (nonselective channel) promotes the release of inflammatory substances,
  including IL-1β and IL-18, due to the large inner diameters of gasdermin pores.
  Subsequently, the formation of these nonselective channels and the influx of water
  contribute to cell swelling, membrane blebbing with bubble-like protrusions (known
  as pyroptotic bodies), continuous cell swelling, and loss of plasma membrane integrity
  to culminate in rupture of the cell membrane. Finally, HMGB1 and ATP are secreted
  after cell membrane rupture, followed by pyroptotic cell death.
