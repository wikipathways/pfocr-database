caption: EBV-induced oncogenesis through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. When JAK
  is activated, it can phosphorylate STAT, and then dimeric STAT is exposed to the
  nuclear signal and enters the nucleus to participate in regulating gene expression.
  LMP1 can activate JAKs and then activate the STAT dimer, which promotes the corresponding
  transcriptional regulation in the nucleus and can provide feedback and enhance the
  regulation of its own expression. LMP1 enhances the transcription of AP-1 through
  JAK/STAT and promotes the expression of PD-L1 to avoid immune surveillance. LMP1
  and LMP2A can activate HLX to inhibit apoptosis
