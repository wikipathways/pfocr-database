caption: (A) Schematic representation of cyanobacterial metabolic pathways leading
  to biofuel (bioethanol) derivatives viz. ethanol, butanol, isobutanol, isopropanol,
  2,3-butanediol, and fatty alcohol; all derived from Calvin cycle and associated
  intermediate biomolecules (especially pyruvate). (B) Synthesis of PHA copolymers
  (PHB and PHBV) through enzyme-mediated 3-step pathway i.e., condensation, reduction,
  and polymerization with precursor acetyl-CoA molecules and through fatty acid β-oxidation
  pathway.
