caption: Coronavirus (CoV) Life Cycle and Host Immune Response.The CoV life cycle
  initiates with the binding of spike proteins on the virion surface to their specific
  receptor [e.g., ACE2 for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)]
  on target cells. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, S protein undergoes
  a conformational change and viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm. Viral
  genomic RNA functions as mRNA, which is translated into polyproteins (pp) pp1a and
  pp1ab, which are then proteolytically cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins
  (nsps). Many nsps synergize to modify the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to
  form double membrane vesicles (DMVs) where transcription of genomic and subgenomic
  RNA occurs. The truncated subgenomic RNA of the 5′-ends are used as templates to
  translate structural (S, E, M, and N) and accessory proteins. S, E, and M assemble
  together with nucleocapsid (one copy of viral genome encapsulated by N proteins)
  at the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and viral progeny are released
  by exocytosis. Host immune responses are triggered by danger signals from infected
  cells or free virions, which are recognized by innate immune cells. Elevated proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines can be seen in asymptomatic to mild cases. Exuberated cytokine
  production resulting in cytokine storm exacerbates the severity of coronavirus disease
  2019 (COVID-19). Lymphopenia (T and B cells) and neutrophil infiltration into infected
  sites contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Several CoV proteins have been
  reported to be capable of inhibiting the type I IFN signaling pathway. Figure created
