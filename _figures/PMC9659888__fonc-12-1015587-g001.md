caption: The main molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis. In the canonical inflammasome
  pathway, cellular signals (e.g. DAMPs and PAMPs) can activate the canonical inflammasome
  and capase-1. Active caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD to unleash its N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N),
  which perforates the cell membrane by forming oligomeric pores. These events lead
  to the loss of membrane integrity and cell lysis. In addition, caspase-1 cleaves
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms, which are released into the extarcellular
  milieu through the GSDMD-N pore. In the non-canoncial inflammasome pathway, cytosolic
  LPS from invading Gram-negative bacteria directly activates inflammatory caspase-4/5/11,
  thus evoking GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. The GSDMD-N pore causes the efflux of potassium
  (K+), eventually inducing the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1-dependent
  IL-1β and IL-18 secretion. In addition, acitve caspase-11 induces the opening of
  the pannexin-1 channel, and thus tiggers the extracellular release of ATP, which
  activates NLRP3 inflammasome via the P2X7 receptor. In caspase-8-mediated pathway,
  the pathogenic Yersinia infection results in inhibition of the TAK1 activity, motivating
  the RIPK1/caspase-8 pathway. Active caspase-8 cleaves GSDMD to produce GSDMD-N,
  resulting in pyroptotic cell death. Under hypoxia conditions, p-STAT3 physically
  binds to PD-L1 and favors its nuclear translocation, where PD-L1 enhances GSDMC
  gene expression. TNF-α-activated caspase-8 specifically shears GSDMC, liberating
  its N-terminal domain (GSDMC-N) that punches holes in the cell membrane and triggers
  pyroptosis. In capase-3-mediated pathway, chemotherapeutic agent-activated caspase-3
  converts GSDME into GSDME-N, which perforates the cell membrane to initiate pyroptosis.
  In the granzyme-mediated pathway, CAR T cells prompt caspase-3/GSDME-dependent pyroptosis
  in target cells by secreting granzyme B. Futhermore, granzyme B directly cuts GSDME
  to drive pyroptosis. In addition, cytotoxic lymphocyte-derived granzyme A can activate
  the pyroptosis signaling pathway via specific cleavage of GSDMB. DAMPs, damage-associated
