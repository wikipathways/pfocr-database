caption: Schematic representation of the proposed connections between senescence,
  hypertension, atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction. Normal aging and deleterious
  stimuli induce senescence in endothelial cells (ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells
  (VSMCs), and foam cells. Accumulation of these senescent cells favors a pro-inflammatory
  state of the vascular bed through the senescence-associated secretory pathway (SASP).
  In turn, the SASP promotes pathological changes leading to the development of hypertension
  and atherosclerosis. In a feedback manner, hypertension and atherosclerosis induce
  more stressors to an already dysfunctional and senescent vessel wall. This vicious
  circle translates into endothelial dysfunction and, eventually, ischemic heart disease.
  Other causal pathways of endothelial dysfunction include hyperglycemia, insulin
  resistance, abnormal endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), genetic predisposition
  and detrimental lifestyle habits such as smoking. ET-1, endothelin-1; MMP, matrix
  metalloproteases; NO, nitric-oxide; RAAS, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
