caption: Dual functions of IRF3 in antiviral defense. Virus infection is recognized
  by the cytoplasmic sensor RIG-I, which binds to viral double-stranded RNA and triggers
  two signaling branches via mitochondrial adaptor IPS1. In the transcriptional pathway,
  IRF3 is translocated to the nucleus to induce antiviral genes, such as the interferon-beta
  (IFN-β) and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). In contrast, in the RIPA branch,
  IRF3 is activated by LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitination, which triggers its interaction
  with BAX to cause mitochondrial activation and apoptotic cell death. Both pathways
  contribute to the overall antiviral responses of the host
