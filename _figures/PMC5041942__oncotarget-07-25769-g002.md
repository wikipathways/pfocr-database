caption: The triangle and rectangles in the network correspond to miRNAs and pathways
  respectively. A. Glioma malignant progression associated miRNA-pathway network.
  A miRNA and pathway connected if the target genes of miRNA were enriched in the
  pathway under the significance level Pvalue <0.05. B. Hsa-miR-302b centered module
  of the glioma malignant progression associated miRNA-pathway crosstalk network.
  C. Cell cycle pathway that regulated by the glioma progression related miRNAs, in
  which the target genes of hsa-miR-302b were annotated. Target genes were marked
  with red node. D. Three modules (module 7, 13 and 102) of the miRNA-pathway crosstalk
  network, in which the miRNA target genes of the corresponding pathway were shown.
