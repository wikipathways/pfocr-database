caption: 'Type I interferon signaling and type I interferonopathies as currently assigned.
  Diseases considered as monogenic interferonopathies are represented by blue boxes.
  This schema alludes to at least seven possible cellular mechanisms resulting in
  sustained activation of interferon signaling caused by the following: (1) loss-of-function
  mutations leading to increased cytosolic DNA (TREX1 [] and SAMHD1 [; ]) or RNA/DNA
  hybrid (RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C, POLA1) sensing (; ; ); (2) loss-of-function
  mutations leading to a defect in RNA editing and abnormal sensing of self–nucleic
  acid RNA species in the cytosol (ADAR1 [; ]); (3) gain-of-function mutations leading
  to constitutive activation of cytosolic interferon signaling pathways/increased
  sensitivity to cytosolic nucleic acid ligands (MDA5 [], RIG-I [], and STING []);
  (4) loss-of-function mutations leading to aberrant RNA signaling via MAVS caused
  by a disturbance of the unfolded protein response (SKIV2L []); (5) loss-of-function
  mutations in molecules responsible for limiting interferon receptor (IFNAR1/2) signaling
  leading to uncontrolled ISG production (USP18 [] and ISG15 []); (6) proteasomal
  dysfunction leading to increased interferon signaling through an unknown mechanism
  (PSMA3, PSMB4, and PSMB8 []; we do not include the so-far single-published mutations
  in PSMB9 and POMP); and (7) loss-of-function mutations in TRAP/ACP5 (; ) and C1q
  (; ) where we consider the mechanisms leading to type I interferon signaling are
  yet to be fully clarified (we do not include mutations in other molecules of the
  complement pathway as a clear demonstration of enhanced interferon signaling has
  not been established).'
