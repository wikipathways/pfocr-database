caption: Potential synthesis pathways of 16 esters and alcohols. For simplification,
  ‘pycom’ in gene nomenclature is abbreviated as ‘pc’. The solid arrows indicate that
  each step of the reaction has been documented. The dashed arrows suggest that the
  reaction steps are not explicitly recorded and are inferred based on the existing
  literature.The following are the full names of the key enzymes. BCAT, Branched-chain
  amino acid aminotransferase; α-KGDH, α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; ACOT, Acyl-CoA
  thioeaterase; PDC, Pyruvate decarboxylase; ADH, Alcohol dehydrogenase; AAT, Alcohol
  acetyltransferase; TD, Threonine dehydratase; LHL, Lipid hydrolase; FAD, Fatty acid
  desaturase; 13-LOX, 13-Lipoxygenase; HPL, Hydroperoxide lyase; ACS, Acyl-CoA Synthetase;
  ACD, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; ECH, Enoyl-CoA hydratase; HADH, Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  BK,Beta-ketothiolase
