caption: The IFN-α is cleared via the binding to the respective receptors in the liver.
  The binding of IFN-α to the IFNAR2 and IFNAR1 takes place in the interstitium of
  the liver (M1-M5), hence activating the JAK/STAT pathway leading to the activation
  of mRNAc of the response protein IRF9 in the intracellular part of the liver (M6-M14).
  The reactions in the interstitim constitute the interaction between the PBPK and
  the intracellular model. Parameterisation is derived from the PBPK model.
