caption: Bartonella effector protein-mediated subversion of host cellular functions.
  (A) BepA AMPylates breast cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 1 (BCAR1) via
  its filamentation induced by cAMP (FIC) domain and interacts with adenylyl cyclase
  7 (AC7) via its Bep intracellular delivery (BID) domain. The AC7-mediated conversion
  of ATP to cAMP results in inhibition of apoptosis. (B) BepC recruits GEF-H1 via
  its FIC domain to activate the RhoA pathway. (C) BepE is required for the dissemination
  within the mammalian host and promotes cell migration. The BID domain of BepE of
  B. quintana becomes ubiquitinated inside host cells and is degraded by autophagy.
  (D) BepG or BepF together with BepC induce stress fiber formation resulting in the
  formation of the invasome. (E) Upregulation of an anti-inflammatory immune response
  depends on the pY-domain of BepD, which provides a binding platform for the SH2
  domain containing proteins c-ABL and STAT3. Due to close proximity, STAT3 becomes
  phosphorylated by c-ABL and triggers gene expression of IL-10. (F) Bep1 AMPylates
  the GDP-bound Rac-subfamily of GTPases. (G) Bep2 AMPylates the vimentin intermediate
  filaments. Dashed arrows indicate currently unknown target proteins, continuous
  arrows display interactions with confirmed targets. Bartonella effector proteins
  (Beps) of lineage 4 of are displayed in purple, Beps of lineage 3 Bartonellae are
  shown in orange.
