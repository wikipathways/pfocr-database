caption: Metabolic parallels between methionine chain elongation in aliphatic GLS
  (left) and the late steps of leucine biosynthesis (right). The dotted line indicates
  the repeated cycles to generate up to six methylene resdues. The genes specified
  in the methionine chain-elongation pathway are highlighted in red. In comparison,
  the genes functional in leucine biosynthetic pathway are highlighted in blue. The
  representative studies referring to the characterization of those genes are shown.
