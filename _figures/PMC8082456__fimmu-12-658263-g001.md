caption: The role of cADP ribose synthase and cGAS/STING pathway in the inhibition
  of anti-tumor immune response. This cartoon describes the mechanism(s) underlying
  the inhibition of the immune response against tumor cells by CD38. On one hand,
  CD38 co-operates with other ectoenzymes (CD203a/ENPP1, CD73, CD39) in the production
  of the immunosuppressive molecule ADO. On the other hand, CD38 depletes NAD+ from
  the extracellular environment, especially in conditions with low pH and hypoxia,
  thus inhibiting tumor cell lysis. cGAS (on the left) metabolizes 2’,3’cyclic GMP-AMP
  (cGAMP) dinucleotide also acting as modulator of the immune system. Hydrolysis of
  cGAMP by CD203a/ENPP1 attenuates cGAS-STING signaling and the cleavage of NAD+.
