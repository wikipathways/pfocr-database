caption: Flavonoid synthesis pathway. CHS (chalcone synthase) can catalyze three molecules
  of malonyl-CoA and one molecule of p-coumaroyl-CoA to form naringeninchalcone [56].
  Malonyl-CoA is an important precursor for the synthesis of natural products, including
  flavonoids and polyketides [57]. CHI (chalcone isomerase) converted naringenin-chalcone
  into flavanones [58]. Naringenin, as an important flavonoid skeleton, is catalyzed
  by FNSI and FNS II (flavone synthase I and flavone synthase II) and IFS (isoflavone
  synthase) to form flavones and isoflavones, respectively [59]. Furthermore, flavanone-3-hydroxylase
  (F3H), flavonol 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H), and flavonol 3′5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H) catalyzed
  naringenin to generate dihydro-myricetin, dihydro-kaempferol, and dihydro-quercetin,
  respectively [60]. The FLS (flavonol synthase) converted dihydroflavonols into flavonols
  (kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin), which was catalyzed by the dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase (DFR) to generate leucoanthocyanidins [61], which was catalyzed by leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase (LDOX) to produce anthocyanidins [62]. Anthocyanidins and leucoanthocyanidins
  were further converted to proanthocyanidins catalyzed by leucoanthocyanidin reductase
  (LAR) and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), respectively [63]. Modification of anthocyanins
  is responsible for the stabilization of vacuolar anthocyanins, including glycosylation,
  methylation, and acylation [64]
