caption: Schematic representation of the proposed pathways activated by LPS to modulate
  mTOR-dependent autophagy and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in Caco-2
  and HT-29 cells. Mammalian TLR4 (Toll like receptor 4) is essential for LPS recognition
  and subsequent immune responses against gram-negative bacteria. Formation of LPS-TLR4
  complex causes the recruitment of intracellular adaptor protein MyD88 (myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88) and leads to the formation of TAK1/TAB1/TAB2 complex.
  Then the activation of MAPKs (p38 kinase, JNK and ERK) induces the phosphorylation
  of mTOR and the activation of canonical NF-κB pathway. The IKK complex (Fig. not
  shown) phosphorylates IκBα, which leads to its ubiquitylaiton and subsequent degradation.
  The mTOR-dependent inhibition of autophagy was further suppressed by activated NF-κB
  signalling. This allows p50 and p65 to translocated to the nucleus and induce the
  expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
