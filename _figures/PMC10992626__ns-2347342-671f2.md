caption: A simplified illustration showing key pathways involved in disc degeneration.
  Increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin
  (IL)-1β, and IL-6 due to injury or aging could (1) induce degradation of lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1); (2) nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mediated activation
  of p65 nuclear translocation, and subsequent promotion of SDC4-ADAMTS-5 proteolytic
  activity causing degrading of disc matrix; (3) activation of Janus tyrosine kinase
  2/signal transducer and activator of the transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) signaling
  pathway elevating IL-6, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) levels, and senescent associated
  factors such as p21/p53; (4) increased expression of senescent cell antiapoptotic
  pathways (SCAPs) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), preventing
  cells from secreting anabolic factors ultimately affecting tissue function. Several
  therapeutics such as Dasatinib and Quercetin (D+Q) senolytic drug, α-ketoglutaric
  acid, and Emodin in preclinical models are shown to delay or prevent degeneration
  by targeting SCAPs, JAK2/ STAT3 signaling axis, and LRP1 signaling pathway, respectively
