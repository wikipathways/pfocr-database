caption: 'Schematic Representation of AAV2-shmTOR Therapy in Age-Related Macular Degeneration
  (AMD). Normal Retina (Left): Illustrates a healthy retina with intact photoreceptor
  cells, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and endothelial cells. Microglia are shown
  resting, contributing to maintaining homeostasis without significant inflammation.
  Pathological Retina (Middle): Depicts an inflamed retina affected by AMD, where
  TNF-α triggers microglia activation, leading to increased secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-6. This inflammatory response activates the NF-κB
  signaling pathway, resulting in cellular damage and disruption of retinal structure.
  AAV2-shmTOR Treated Retina (Right): Demonstrates the therapeutic effect of AAV2-shmTOR
  in reducing retinal inflammation. After treatment, AAV2-shmTOR significantly reduces
  the expression of IL-1β and IL-6, restoring the structural integrity of retinal
  cells and reducing inflammatory damage. Green microglia: Resting microglia; Red
  microglia: Activated microglia; Orange/Yellow dots: IL-1β and IL-6 cytokines; Red
  diamond: TNF-α; Blue particles: AAV2-shmTOR. AAV2, adeno-associated virus serotype
  2; shmTOR, short hairpin RNA targeting mTOR; AMD, age-related macular degeneration;
  IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha;
  RPE, retinal pigment epithelium. Data Availability Statement'
