caption: Proposed model for the role of lncRNAs in p53 pathway. LncRNA-RoR binds to
  hnRNP-I to suppress p53 mRNA translation and phosphorylated p53 activates the lncRNA-RoR
  transcription. This forms an autoregulatory feedback loop that controls p53 levels.
  After DNA damage p53 directly binds at the CDKN1A locus and activates the transcription
  of CDKN1A, PANDA and LincRNA-p21. p21 mediates cell cycle arrest, PANDA inhibits
  NF-YA to block apoptosis and LincRNA-p21 mediates gene silencing through recruitment
  of hnRPK to promote apoptosis. p53 induced eRNAs are involved in activation of p53-target
  genes and mediate p53-dependent cell cycle arrest.
