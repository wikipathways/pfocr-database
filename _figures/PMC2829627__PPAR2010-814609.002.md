caption: Tumor-associated angiogenesis is sustained through stromal microenvironment
  crosstalk. Most tumors are associated with the activation of tumor-promoting innate
  immune responses involving neutrophils, macrophages, and NK cells. Specific (adaptive)
  antitumor immune responses involving T- or B-lymphocytes are less efficient in suppressing
  tumor growth. Increased formation of blood and lymphatic vessels in bone marrow
  and lymph nodes provide oxygen and nutrients to malignant cells. Stromal cells,
  including ECs, inflammatory cells, and fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, produce cytokines
  and growth factors that act in a paracrine fashion to promote malignant cell proliferation
  or survival. In turn, malignant cells produce angiogenic factors and express their
  cognate receptors establishing functional autocrine loops to perpetuate their survival
  including signaling through the VEGF pathway [–, ]. The secreted factors produced
  by and in response to those secreted by stromal and tumor cells include, but are
  not limited to VEGF, FGF-2, PDGF, IGF-1, HSF, TGF-α, TGF-β, TNF-α, IL-8, MCP-1/CCL2,
  MIF, IL-6, and IL-1 []. The potent vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 has been
  implicated in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and its complications [], as
  well as tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [, ]. Proteases important for invasion
  thorough the basement membrane and remodeling of the ECM, such as plasminogen []
  and MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-9 [], and their inhibitors, PAI-1/2 and TIMPs,
  respectively, are produced by stromal and tumor cells. Downregulation of endogenous
  inhibitors of angiogenesis such as thrombospondin (TSP)-1 occurs in the stromal
  compartment as well to favor angiogenesis, cancer cell growth, and metastasis [].
  In recent years, it has been recognized that a better understanding of the tumor-stromal
  microenvironment crosstalk may lead to elucidation of new therapeutic strategies
  for cancer therapy [–].
