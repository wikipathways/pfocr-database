caption: Evidence for indirect influence of kinases on tau phosphorylation. The diagrams
  shown represent known interactions, direct and indirect, between kinases (green
  circles) and tau (red circles). Molecules are represented by node icons. Different
  shaped node icons represent different families of proteins. Edges between nodes
  represent an inhibitory interaction (red), an activating interaction (green), or
  an unknown interaction (gray). The kinases shown (green circles) were identified
  as having a putative indirect effect on tau (red circles) phosphorylation by activation
  or inhibition of an intermediary protein. Interactions were identified using the
  GeneGo MetaCore pathway analysis software Shortest Paths algorithm. cat, catalytic.
