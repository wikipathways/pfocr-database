caption: The SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle and selected host proteins involved. The
  viral life cycle is displayed proceeding from host cell entry through new virion
  synthesis, packaging, and export. Host cell proteins are labeled in green, and SARS-CoV-2
  proteins are labeled in blue. Red arrows (→) indicate protease cleavage. The representation
  of virus shows ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (consisting of five dimers of N) in the
  tetrahedral geometry recently reported (Yao et al. ()). This article reported an
  average of 26 ± 15 copies of prefusion S per virion and 26 ± RNPs per virion. The
  life cycle in a given cell begins with host cell entry mediated by ACE2 (the receptor),
  TMPRSS2 (or alternatively CatB/L—CSTB/CTSL—fusion priming enzymes), and proceeds
  with trafficking through endosomes. Endosomal maturation required for viral–host–cell
  membrane fusion involves the proteins PIKfyve and TPC2. After fusion and uncoating
  of the viral RNA, the replication-transcription complex is expressed, and new viral
  genomic RNAs (gRNAs, + and − sense) and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs, + and − sense)
  are produced. The translation of viral proteins and modulation of host protein translation
  is affected by protein–protein interactions (Nsp2-eIFE2/GIGYF2, Nsp9-eIF4H, and
  N-LARP1 are shown) and signaling. New virion structural protein N is phosphorylated
  (CK2, PKC, and CDK), forms RNPs, winds gRNAs, and collects at the ERGIC membrane
  for envelopment. Viral proteins E, M, and S traffic through the secretory pathway
  for further processing including addition of glycans. Filopodia formation is enhanced
  (proposed to be CK2 driven by Bouhaddou et al. ()) and may improve transmission
  of egressing virus between cells. ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; CTSL, cathepsin
  L; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum golgi intermediate compartment; SARS-CoV-2, severe
  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TMPRSS2, transmembrane serine protease 2.
