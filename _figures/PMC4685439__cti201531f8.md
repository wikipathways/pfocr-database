caption: Normal response, disruption and partial restoration of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  response. (a) The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway promotes homeostasis by
  decreasing inflammation through the release of ACh and subsequent interaction with
  the macrophages' α7. (b) gp120IIIB exposure promotes α7 upregulation in macrophages
  and ACh addition does not reduce inflammation. (c) Bupropion partially restores
  the cholinergic anti-inflammatory response by reducing some chemokines but not ILs.
