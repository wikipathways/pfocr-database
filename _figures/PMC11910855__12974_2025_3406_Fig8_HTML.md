caption: The schematic diagram illustrates the impact of targeted activation of ErbB4
  receptor on hippocampal neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and cognitive functions
  in mice exposed to PS-MPs. The small molecule ErbB4 receptor agonist (E4A) binds
  to the ErbB4 receptor, initiating its downstream signaling pathway. This activation
  leads to the upregulation of SIRT3 protein expression, which enhances mitochondrial
  redox homeostasis, increases ATP production, and ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Additionally, there is an upregulation of synaptic-related proteins, which contributes
  to the repair of synaptic damage and enhancement of synaptic function. As hippocampal
  neuronal function improves, the activation of the TLR4 receptor by pro-inflammatory
  factors in microglia is reduced, resulting in diminished phosphorylation of NF-κB
  and decreased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome towards Caspase-1. Consequently,
  there is a reduction in the conversion of the IL-1β precursor to its mature form,
  thereby alleviating hippocampal neuroinflammation and ultimately enhancing the learning
  and cognitive functions of PS-MPs-exposed mice. The diagram was created with MedPeer
