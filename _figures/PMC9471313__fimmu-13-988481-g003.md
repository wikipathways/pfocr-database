caption: Regulation of the gut microbiome by dietary sugars. Excessive consumption
  of dietary sugars reduces the production of short-chain fatty acids in the gut,
  which can lead to impaired gut barriers. This results in a rapid increase in infiltration
  of neutrophils while accelerating the transfer of Parabacteroides, ie, lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS). The binding of LPS to TOLL-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activates the nuclear factor-κB
  (NF-κB) signaling pathway, and finally induces the production of inflammatory factors
  IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α. On the other hand, the excessive dietary sugar content makes
  Bacillus fragilis and Prevotella abundant, thereby destroying the intestinal mucosa.
  In the meanwhile, the relative abundance of sugar-soluble bacteria Sutterellaceae
  increased while the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae, which belonged
  to Firmicutes, decreased, eventually increasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines
  IL-6, TNF-a, Lcn2 and Cox2. Increased neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory factor
  production aggravate the occurrence and development of IBD.
