caption: Model for PI3K action in chemoattractant signaling to ACA. PI3K activity
  can simultaneously control the activation and adaptation phases of the chemoattractant-mediated
  ACA response through branching pathways. We propose that the excitatory pathway
  is more sensitive and/or kinetically fast compared with the inhibitory pathway,
  requiring minimal PI3K input for a robust response. Thus, in pi3k1-/2- cells, which
  only display ∼4% PI3K activity compared with wild-type cells, ACA is still activated.
  This excitation pathway functions through the PI3K-dependent action of CRAC. TORC2
  is also required for ACA activation, but at this time it is not clear how it interacts
  with the PI3K pathway in this response. In contrast, the inhibition branch is less
  sensitive and/or kinetically slower. Thus, in pi3k1-/2- cells, ACA activation is
  normal, but the adaptation response is severely impaired. General inhibition of
  PI3K activity with LY294002 severely impairs ACA activation, thus adaptation is
  moot. An alternative, though not mutually exclusive, interpretation of our data
  is that specific PI3K isoforms independently control the ACA activation and adaptation
  pathways or that distinct activities of PI3K, i.e., protein kinase and lipid kinase,
  are involved. Global stimulation of the entire cellular complement of G proteins,
  both heterotrimeric and small GTPases, with GTPγS stimulates ACA activity in wild-type
  cells, but it does not lead to ACA activation in pi3k1-/2- cells, raising the possibility
  that G protein action downstream of PI3K may control the adaptation/inhibition branch,
  as outlined in Discussion.
