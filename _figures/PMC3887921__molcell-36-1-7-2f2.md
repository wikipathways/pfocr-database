caption: Regulation of autophagy by nutrient signals. Autophagy responds to regulation
  by nutrient signals, which operate a signaling pathway involving mammalian (or mechanistic)
  target of rapamycin (mTOR). Autophagy is negatively regulated by the Class I phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, which activates mTOR in response to insulin
  and other growth factors. Akt may also negatively regulate autophagy by phosphorylating
  Beclin 1. The adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which is
  regulated by AMP levels, negatively regulates mTOR, and also phosphorylates ULK1,
  thereby acting as a positive regulator of autophagy in response to energy exhaustion.
  mTOR is a major component of the mTOR signaling complex (mTORC1), which regulates
  the ULK1 complex, consisting of the mammalian uncoordinated-51-like protein kinase
  ULK1, ATG13, ATG101, and FIP200. Under nutrient rich conditions, mTORC1 inhibits
  ULK1 kinase activity, thereby inhibiting the activation of autophagy. Autophagy
  is also regulated by the Beclin 1 interactive complex, consisting of Beclin 1, class
  III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (VPS34 or PI3KC3) and ATG14L. Stimulation of this
  complex generates phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), which triggers autophagosomal
  membrane nucleation. Several interacting factors may participate in this regulation,
  including UVRAG and Bif-1, which substitute for ATG14L, Ambra1, the negative regulator
  Rubicon, and Bcl-2 family proteins.
