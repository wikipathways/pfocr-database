caption: Schema of the relationship between HER2 mutations and APC mutations in colorectal
  cancer cells. HER2 G776S is a mutation that increases HER2 kinase activity, although
  the activity is weak. APC loss-of-function increases Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation
  but also increases the amount of RAS-GTP, which helps the HER2 G776S mutation to
  activate the HER2-ERK pathway.
