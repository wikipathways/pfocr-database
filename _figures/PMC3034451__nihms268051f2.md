caption: '(A) The conserved Sec pathway exports unfolded preproteins that are synthesized
  with N-terminal signal peptides (hatched marks). The SecA ATPase recognizes and
  drives preproteins through the SecYEG membrane channel using repeated rounds of
  ATP-binding and hydrolysis. The SecD, SecF and YajC proteins increase efficiency
  of Sec protein export. During or shortly after translocation, the signal peptide
  is removed by a membrane-bound SP. The exported protein folds into a mature conformation.
  (B) The accessory SecA2 system of mycobacteria is characterized by a functionally
  distinct ATPase called SecA2, which is required for the export of a subset of proteins.
  Current data suggests that SecA2 uses the canonical SecA1/SecYEG translocase for
  exporting proteins, but the possibility of a requirement for a distinct channel
  within the membrane has not yet been eliminated. Some SecA2-dependent exported proteins
  have signal peptides and some do not. The role of SecA2 in the export of proteins
  lacking signal peptides is unresolved. (C) The conserved Tat pathway exports folded
  preproteins containing N-terminal signal peptides with a twin-arginine (RR) motif.
  Tat preproteins are recognized by the TatBC complex in the membrane and then translocated
  across a homo-oligomeric TatA channel. As with Sec export, the signal peptide is
  removed by a membrane-bound SP.RR: Arginine residues; Sec: Secretion; SP: Signal
  peptidase; tat: Twin arginine translocation.'
