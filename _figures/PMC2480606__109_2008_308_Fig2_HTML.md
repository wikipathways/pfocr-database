caption: NF-κB pathway in skeletal muscles. NF-κB binds on κB sites of the cyclin
  D1 promoter and regulates its transcription. Moreover, the p65/p50 heterodimer complex
  binds to the transcriptional repressor YY1, resulting in inhibition of skeletal
  myogenesis. TNF-α and TWEAK activation regulates MyoD1 expression through a p65/p50
  complex. In response to TNF signaling, PW1 associates with TRAF2, induces Bax translocation
  in mitochondria, and through activation of caspases, leads to inhibition of muscle
  differentiation. TNF-α signaling is important for the activation of satellite cells
  during muscle regeneration, through the MAP kinase p38. Synergistic effects of TNF
  and INF-γ result in muscle atrophy. Stable expression of constitutively active CnA
  in C2C12 cells induces NF-κB activation in a TNF-α-independent mechanism. Intracellular
  calcium in muscle cells activates calpain 3, which induces IκBα degradation, leading
  to NF-κB activation and translocation into the nucleus, where it regulates expression
  of survival genes. Upon denervation-induced atrophy, NF-κB binds on the promoter
  of MuRF1. Upon unloaded-induced atrophy, complexes comprising of p50 and Bcl-3 subunits
  are activated and translocate into the nucleus to regulate transcription of target
  genes. MuRF1 Murine ring finger-1, YY1 YinYang1, PW1/Peg3 paternally expressed 3,
  TWEAK TNF weak inducer of apoptosis, CnA activated form of calcineurin A, Bax Bcl-2-associated
  X protein, TRAF2 TNF-receptor-associated factor 2, RIP receptor-interacting protein,
  TNFR1 tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, INF-γR1 interferon-γ receptor 1, IKK IκB
  kinase, NEMO NF-κB essential modulator
