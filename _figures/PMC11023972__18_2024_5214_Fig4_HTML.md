caption: DDR components regulate NF-κB signaling pathways. Although a few DDR components
  have been elucidated to be involved in the NF-κB signaling pathway, the inflammation
  response is extensively activated in the DNA-damage repairing process. Therefore,
  the specific roles of DDR components in NF-κB signaling pathway may be explored
  in the future
