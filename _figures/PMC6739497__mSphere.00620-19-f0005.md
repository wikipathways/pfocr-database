caption: Upregulation of genes in the SNARE interactions in vesicular transport pathway
  during treatment with compound 9029936. KEGG analysis indicated that a total of
  20 genes involved in the SNARE interactions in vesicular transport pathway, indicated
  in red in the map, were significantly upregulated in C. albicans cells treated with
  5 μM compound 9029936 versus untreated control cultures.
