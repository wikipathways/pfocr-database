caption: A Model of SPX4-PHR2 Module to Monitor the Cellular Pi Concentration for  Transcription.In
  high cellular Pi, SPX4 interacts with PHR2 both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus,
  reducing the nuclear targeting of PHR2 and repressing PHR2 binding to the P1BS motif
  in the promoters of  genes. In low cellular Pi, SPX4 is degraded through the proteasome
  pathway, efficiently promoting the targeting of PHR2 to nucleus and enhancing its
  P1BS binding ability, resulting in upregulation of  genes. Negative and positive
  regulatory effects are indicated by flat-ended lines and arrows, respectively. The
  thick arrow represents enhancement. The dotted lines indicate reduced effects.
