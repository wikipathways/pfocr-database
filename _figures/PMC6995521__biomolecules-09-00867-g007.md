  and utilization are indicated in blue font and arrows; fatty acid production and
  β-oxidation are in orange font and arrows; and amino acid metabolism is in purple
  font and arrows. Protein full names and all the supporting references are provided
  in the . In glucose production and utilization, GAA (a lysosomal enzyme) catalyzes
  glucose release from glycogen. Simultaneously, in the cytoplasm, glucose-1-phosphate
  (1P) is generated by GALE action, which catalyzes the final step in the major pathway
  of galactose metabolism. Both glucose and glucose-1P are fuel for glycolysis, which
  produces energy in the form of ATP. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, enters
  the mitochondria and is converted to acetyl CoA by the PDH complex containing PDHX.
  This PDH-dependent reaction is the rate limiting step for the utilization of pyruvate
  under aerobic conditions. Further, in the fatty acid-related pathways, free fatty
  acids can be released in lysosomes from the breakdown of ceramides by ASAH1 and
  then reach the mitochondria, where they enter β-oxidation. The last step in β-oxidation
  is catalyzed by ACAA2 to yield acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA from both pyruvate and fatty
  acid β-oxidation enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) to produce ATP. Lastly,
  in amino acid metabolism, the amino acid levels in the lysosomes are sensed by the
  protein complex including LAMTOR3 and V-ATPase (a proton pump). In the cytoplasm,
  3P-hydroxypyruvate (produced from the glycolysis intermediate) is converted to 3P-serine
  by PSAT1. In the mitochondria, homocysteine thiolactone (a by-product of protein
  biosynthesis) could be converted to homocysteine by BPHL. Both 3P-serine and homocysteine
  are the precursors of cysteine used for protein synthesis. Catabolism of proteins
  produces urea, which can be transported from cells by SLC14A1. The expression of
  all the enzymes indicated in this figure was increased in the Cyp27a1−/−Cyp46a1−/−Soat1−/−
  vs. WT retina, thus raising a possibility of increased energy production as well
  as altered protein homeostasis.
