  occurs between colostral and transitional stages; Panel B: UDP-Glucose production

  while LALBA continues to increase in expression. Panels A-B: Gene symbols are detailed
  in . Color denotes change in gene expression from colostrum to transitional (Panel
  A) or transitional to mature (Panel B): red = significant increase; green = significant
  decrease; and yellow = no significant change in gene express levels between stages.
