caption: 'Notch signalling is initiated when a cell-surface-expressed Delta ligand
  binds to the Notch receptor expressed on an opposing cell surface. The membrane-tethered
  Notch is then cleaved by ADAM10 and then by the γ-secretase complex to release the
  intracellular fragment of Notch (NICD). This translocates to the nucleus and assembles
  into a transcriptional activation complex that relieves repression of Notch target
  genes such as the Hes family. The Hes family of transcriptional repressors controls
  Delta and a variety of differentiation/proliferation genes. An important function
  of the Notch pathway is in lateral inhibition—an interaction between equal adjacent
  cells that serves to drive them towards different final states. The basic principle
  of lateral inhibition is that activation of Notch represses production of the Notch
  ligand (Delta). Consequently, the cell with lower Notch activity produces more ligand
  (a status reinforced by derepression of the transcription factor Atoh1, which directly
  activates Delta transcription). More ligand at the cell surface activates Notch
  signalling in the neighbouring cell which results in reduced ligand production in
  that cell. This in turn enables the cell with lower Notch activity to increase its
  ligand production even further, because it receives a weakened inhibitory signal
  back from its neighbours. The effect of this feedback loop is that any initial difference
  in Notch activity between them, whether stochastic or genetically controlled, is
  amplified to drive the neighbouring cells into opposite Notch-level status and hence
  into different developmental pathways. Notch plays an important role in maintaining
  the intestinal stem cell pool: Paneth cells, and perhaps other sources, provide
  a constant Notch ligand stimulus to ISCs. In the TA compartment, Notch-high progenitors
  will differentiate to enterocytes while they will push neighbouring cells to commit
  to a secretory fate.'
