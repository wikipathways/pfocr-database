caption: Illustration of the metabolism of galactose through the Leloir pathway. Galactose
  (Gal) is converted to Gal-1-P by the action of the enzymes GALM and GALK1. Gal-1-P
  is converted into Glc-1-P by GALT/GALE. Furthermore, Glc-1-P is converted to Glc-6-P
  (by PGM1 and PGM2), which follows the glycolytic pathway similar to glucose metabolism.
  Glc-1-P can also be converted to Glc-1,6-P2 (by PGM2L1), which is a master allosteric
  controller that can inhibit HK (glycolysis) and 6PGGDH (PPP).
