caption: A schematic diagram in the form of flowchart that depicts explicitly multiple
  feedback and feed-forward loop mechanisms emerging from within the PI3K/mTOR pathway
  and its crosstalk with other pathways. For each mechanism, the underlying biological
  details are highlighted. mTORC2 phosphorylates IR and IGF-IR on tyrosine residues
  1131/1136 and 1146/1151. mTORC2 stabilises Fbw8 to translocate into the cytosol
  and ubiquitinate IRS1. Akt enhances glucose uptake, which activates mTORC2 through
  acetyl-CoA-mediated acetylation of RICTOR. IKKα is phosphorylated at Thr-23 and
  activated by Akt, which leads to activation of mTORC1 through the phosphorylation
  at Ser-1415 residue and mTORC2 via an unknown mechanism. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt
  at Ser-473 and activated Akt phosphorylates Sin1 at Thr-86 and consequently activates
  mTORC2. Akt promotes Rb hyper-phosphorylation through inhibition of GSK3β and cyclin
  D1. Hyper-phosphorylated Rb binds to and inhibits Sin1, leading to inhibition of
  mTORC2. mTORC1 phosphorylates (at Thr-389) and activates S6K1, which in turn phosphorylates
  RICTOR at Tyr-1135, inhibiting the mTORC2 activity. S6K also phosphorylates IRS1
  at Ser-636/639/1011, causing IRS1 inhibition. DEPTOR blocks mTORC1/2 activation
  and mTORC1/2 downregulate DEPTOR. mTORC1 phosphorylates and stabilizes Grb10, which
  is linked to inhibition of IR/IGFR. PTEN dephosphorylates TSC1/2, which blocks mTORC1
  activation. mTORC1 increases eIF4E activity, resulting in upregulation of PTEN translation
  and expression. Akt phosphorylates and inhibits FOXO. Unphosphorylated FOXO inhibits
  PP2A, which dephosphorylates Akt and blocks its activity. Akt enhances cyclin A
  expression. The cyclin A2-CDK2 complex phosphorylates Akt at Ser-477 and Thr-479,
  which stabilises Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation and promotes Akt activity. Glucose
  uptake is enhanced by Akt, leading to activation of mTORC2 through acetyl-CoA-mediated
  RICTOR acetylation.
