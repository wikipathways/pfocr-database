caption: (A) Isoflavans such as vestitol have been demonstrated to be formed through
  the enzymatic reduction (pterocarpan reductase, PTR) of their pterocarpan precursors
  such as medicarpin. The dihydrofuran ring cleavage explains the origin of the hydroxyl
  attached to C-2′ (in red), and present in most isoflavans []. (A and B) Isoflavans
  and pterocarpans are generally among the end products of the flavonoids biosynthetic
  pathway, and are formed through at least four enzymatic steps, symbolized by the
  arrows starting from the corresponding isoflavone. (C) A pterocarpan prenyltransferase
  (GmG4DT), identified in Soybean was demonstrated to be responsible for the prenylation
  on C-8 (in purple) of pterocarpans []. Considering the known enzymatic activity
  of PTR, shinpterocarpin, also found in the roots of G. glabra [], can be considered
  as the putative biosynthetic precursor of Glab.
