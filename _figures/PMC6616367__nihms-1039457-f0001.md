caption: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor kappa
  B (IKK/NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) development. In the development of inflammation-associated HCC, the IKK/NF-κB,
  JNK, and apoptosis pathways play both pro- and antitumorigenic roles. Activation
  of death receptors, including TNF receptor type I, leads to the formation of “complexI,”
  consisting of TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), TNF receptor-associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP). Polyubiquitination
  of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) recruits and activates the TAK1 and IKK
  complexes (IKKα/IKKβ/NF-kappa-B essential modulator [NEMO]). TAK1 activates the
  JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in a phosphorylation-dependent
  manner. TAK1 also phosphorylates and activates the IKK complex, leading to the phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBα. This degradation results in the nuclear
  translocation and activation of NF-κB, comprising the p50 and p65 subunits. NF-κB
  promotes tumorigenesis by inducing inflammatory factors but prevents tumorigenesis
  by suppressing apoptotic pathways. NEMO regulates NF-κB activation and directly
  prevents the formation of the complex IIb (RIP kinase 1 [RIPK1], Fas-associated
  protein with death domain [FADD], caspase-8). RIPK1 kinase induces complex IIb-mediated
  hepatocyte apoptosis. NEMO and RIPK1 negatively regulate the formation of complex
  IIa (TRADD, FADD, caspase-8). Inhibition of caspase-8 and/or FADD leads to phosphorylation
  of RIP1 and RIP3 and induction of necroptosis. JNK is crucial for compensatory proliferation
  by increasing c-Myc and decreasing p21.

  description: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, IkappaB kinase/nuclear factor
    kappa B (IKK/NF-κB), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and apoptosis in hepatocellular

    the IKK/NF-κB, JNK, and apoptosis pathways play both pro- and antitumorigenic
