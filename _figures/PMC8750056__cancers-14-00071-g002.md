caption: The RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs) integrate signals from extracellular growth factors to recruit guanine nucleotide
  exchange factors (GEFs), which promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras. In its
  GTP-bound state, RAS activates downstream effector pathways, including the RAF/MEK/ERK
  and PI3K/AKT pathways. GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) promote the hydrolysis
  of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP, thereby downregulating both Raf/MAPK and PI3K signaling.
  The PI3K pathway is negatively regulated by phosphatases such as PTEN. Dual-specificity
  phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) negatively regulates MAPK signaling by dephosphorylating ERK.
  Mutant forms of RAS are resistant to GAP-mediated GTPase stimulation and are locked
  permanently in the GTP-bound active state, resulting in continuous stimulation of
  the MAPK cascade without ligand binding. A solid red circle indicates a ligand for
  RTK.
