caption: Models to explain the AD series of compounds in dRetMEN2B transgenic flies.
  Pathway components blocked by inhibitors have been boxed, with resulting flux indicated
  by orange lines and arrows, and the incoherent feed-forward (i.f.f.) loop highlighted
  in blue. Grey dashed lines indicate loss of dTor inhibition. Targets in black boxes
  contribute to efficacy whereas inhibition of the anti-target dTor (red) leads to
  hyperactivation of the Ras pathway, causing high toxicity in the MEN2 model. The
  polypharmacological profile of AD80 best addresses the three key pathways, providing
  high drug efficacy and optimal therapeutic index.
