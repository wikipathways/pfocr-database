caption: 'Figure 1. Unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in eukaryotes. (A) The
  mammalian UPR pathway consists of three ER-transmembrane sensor proteins, IRE1,
  PERK, and ATF6. Activation of IRE1 cleaves the 26 nt intron of XBP1u mRNA, and the
  activated XBP1s bZIP transcription factor upregulates many essential UPR target
  genes. On the other hand, the translated XBP1u protein appears to sequester XBP1s
  protein in the cytosol. IRE1 also controls selective mRNA decay (RIDD). Activation
  of PERK blocks general protein synthesis and increases the specific translation
  of ATF4 mRNA via phosphorylation of eIF2α. The ATF4 bZIP transcription factor induces
  expression of UPR target genes. ATF6 is a type II ER transmembrane protein with
  a bZIP domain. Upon ER stress, ATF6 is translocated to the Golgi and processed proteolytically
  by site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P); the ATF6 fragment with the bZIP
  domain (ATF6f) is then released and translocates to the nucleus to activate UPR
  genes. (B) The UPR pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana consists of two branches: one
  involving endoribonuclease IRE1 and the other involving the proteolytic processing
  of membrane-associated bZIP transcription factors (bZIP17/28). Upon ER stress, IRE1
  removes the 23 nt intron of bZIP60 mRNA, resulting in a bZIP protein lacking a transmembrane
  domain (bZIP60s) via frameshift translation. The bZIP60s transcription factor translocates
  to the nucleus to activate UPR target genes. Similar to mammalian ATF6, the membrane-associated
  bZIP transcription factors (bZIP17/28) are processed at the Golgi by S1P and S2P,
  releasing the truncated versions of bZIP17/28 into the nucleus to activate UPR target
  genes. Regulated IRE1-dependent decay of specific mRNAs in Arabidopsis has also
  been observed recently. (C) The yeast Saccharomyces UPR pathway is composed of the
  Ire1 kinase and the Hac1 bZIP transcription factor. Accumulation of unfolded or
  misfolded proteins in the ER lumen causes Ire1 to dimerize and trans-autophosphorylate
  through its kinase domain. The activated Ire1 kinase removes the unconventional
  intron (252 nt) of the HAC1 mRNA and a tRNA ligase, Rlg1, joins the two exons without
  the help of conventional spliceosomes. Spliced HAC1 mRNA is translated to produce
  an active Hac1 protein, which translocates to the nucleus to upregulate expression
  of UPR target genes encoding ER-resident chaperones and other proteins. “K” and
  “R” in Ire1 indicate the kinase and ribonuclease domains, respectively.'
