caption: The primary cytoplasmic DNA sensors activated by cytosolic mtDNA. Upon mtDNA
  leakage into the cytosol, various forms of mtDNA activate DNA sensors including
  cGAS, NLRP3, AIM2, TLR9, and ZBP1, thereby triggering inflammatory responses, necroptosis,
  and PANoptosis. The cGAS-STING signaling pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome exhibit
  varying degrees of crosstalk with mitochondrial autophagy, with the NLRP3 inflammasome
  further promoting ox-mtDNA leakage by enhancing mtROS production
