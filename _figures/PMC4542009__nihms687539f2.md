caption: In mammals there are multiple deltalike ligands (Dlls), one of which, Dll4,
  is highly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis.
  It tends to be expressed at higher levels in the “tip” cells of sprouting vessels
  and is induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Dll4 binds to notch
  receptors, two of which (notch 1 and notch 4) are expressed in the vascular endothelial
  cells composing the “stalk” component of a growing capillary sprout, adjacent to
  the tip cells. The interaction of Dll4 and notch receptors through the contact of
  adjacent endothelial cells leads to a series of proteolytic events whereby a notch
  intracellular signaling domain is cleaved and released by a γ-secretase; the domain
  then translocates to the nucleus. There it interacts with transcription factors
  and induces the expression of various target genes. The induction of Dll4–notch
  signaling is thought to act as a damping mechanism to prevent excessive angiogenesis
  and to promote the orderly development of new blood vessels. Blockade of Dll4–notch
  signaling interferes with this negative feedback mechanism, resulting in an increased
  density of vascular sprouts and branches, but these blood vessels are highly abnormal
  and do not perfuse blood adequately, leading to major increases in tumor hypoxia.
  The combined use of an anti-VEGF drug and a Dll4-targeting drug can be more effective
  than either drug used alone, and tumors that are resistant to an anti-VEGF drug
  can be treated with a Dll4-targeting drug. Thurston et al. describe more molecular
  details of Dll–notch receptor signaling and the domain structure of the receptor.
  VEGFR-2 denotes vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.
