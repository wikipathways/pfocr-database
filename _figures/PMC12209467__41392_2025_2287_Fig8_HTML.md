caption: BMPR2 and TGF-β crosstalk with other signaling pathways in PH. a, b The networks
  of BMPR2 and other signaling pathways in PH. In PAECs, reduced BMPR2 signaling activates
  TGF-β, triggering EndMT and inflammation through Smad1/5, Smad2/3, and p38 pathways.
  Additionally, reduced BMPR2 signaling activates ERK1/2 pathways, promoting anti-apoptosis.
  In PASMCs, reduced BMPR2 signaling, influenced by ET-1 and HMGB1-induced apoptosis,
  supports proliferation and survival via the TGF-β/Smad1/5/8, and p38 pathways. Hypoxia
  and MCT stimulate HIF-1α and NF-κB, reducing BMPR2 expression through miR-130a,
  which promotes EndMT, inflammation, and apoptosis by suppressing β-catenin pathways
  in PAECs. In PASMCs, PH-induced TNF downregulates BMPR2 signaling, driving cell
  proliferation and glycolysis through the activation of BMP6/ALK2 and β-catenin,
  while suppressing miR-124-3p. c The networks of TGF-β and other signaling pathways

  to cell proliferation, inflammation, EndMT, ECM remodeling, fibrosis, and myofibroblast
  differentiation across various cell types (PAECs, PASMCs, PAFs and RVFs), primarily
  through the activation of the TGFβR and its interactions with key pathways like
