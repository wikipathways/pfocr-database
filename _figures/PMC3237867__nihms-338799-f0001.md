caption: Metabolic pathways, transport, and receptors of S1P. a De novo sphingolipid
  metabolism starts at the endoplasmic reticulum where serine palmitoyltransferase
  condesates serine and palmitate into 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine, followed by sequential
  conversion to dihydrosphingosine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide by the action of
  3-keto-dihydrosphingosine reductase, dihydroceramide synthases, and dihydroceramide
  desaturase, respectively. Ceramide, generated either from the de novo pathway or
  from degradation of complex sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids,
  is deacylated by ceramidase to sphingosine, followed by phosphorylation by sphingosine
  kinase to produce S1P. S1P is dephosphorylated to sphingosine by S1P phosphatase
  or by lipid phosphate phosphatases, or is irreversibly degraded to phosphoethanolamine
  and hexadecenal by S1P lyase. b S1P produced intracellularly is transported by specific
  transporters such as Spns2 and carried by carrier proteins such as HDL-associated
  apoM and albumin. c S1P activates S1P receptors, S1P1–5, which transmit diverse
  intracellular signals depending on the coupled Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G protein
  and the expression pattern of each receptors in a given cell type
