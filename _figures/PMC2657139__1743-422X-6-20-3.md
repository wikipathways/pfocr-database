caption: Subcellular localization and metabolic pathways of significantly-modulated
  genes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway during the pre-viremic stage of LCMV-WE
  infection in macaque liver tissues. Red or green color corresponds to up- or down-regulation
  of gene expression, respectively. ATP citrate lyase is encoded by ACLY (Tables  and
  ), Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is encoded by ACACB (Table ), thiolase is encoded by ACAT2
  (Tables  and ), 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase is encoded by HADHA (Table ), enoyl-CoA
  hydratase is encoded by ECHS1 (Table ) and acyl-CoA desaturase is encoded by SCD
  (Table ).
