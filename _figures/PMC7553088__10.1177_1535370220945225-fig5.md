caption: Schematic overview of chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) involved in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) via IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. CKLF1 activated the IL-6/STAT3
  signaling pathway, which enhanced HCC progression and aerobic glycolysis. With the
  use of static, the process was inhibited. Besides, CKLF1 decreased the efficacy
  of doxorubicin-induced HCC cells apoptosis and increased the levels of STAT3-related
  cytokines. (A color version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
