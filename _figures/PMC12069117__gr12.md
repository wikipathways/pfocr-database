caption: APP is cleaved by either α- or β-secretase in the non-amyloidogenic and amyloidogenic
  pathways. The non-amyloidogenic pathway generates sAPP-α and C83 (left). The amyloidogenic
  pathway produces sAPP-β and C99 (right). Gamma-secretase cleaves C99 to produce
  AICD and Aβ (right)120. Reproduced integrally with permission from Ref. 120. Copyright
