caption: Schematic diagram representing mitophagy and altered expression of mitophagy
  regulators in LPS-induced ALI. Under LPS stimulation, Bcl-2 expression is downregulated
  and Bad expression is upregulated. With mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation,
  cell apoptosis and mitophagy were initiated through the activation of the PINK1/Parkin
  pathway, leading to ALI. Bcl-2 functions to inhibit the recruitment of Parkin from
  the cytoplasm to the mitochondria by direct interaction with Parkin, while Bad exerts
  direct inhibition of the antimitophagic protein Bcl-2.
