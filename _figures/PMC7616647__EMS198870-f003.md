caption: (1) The target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway is activated in an amino
  acid-rich environment. Activated TOR complex 1 (TORC1) phosphorylates S6 kinase
  (S6K) and inhibits autophagy-related 1 (Atg1), promoting protein translation and
  inhibiting autophagy, respectively. (2) The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling
  (IIS) pathway is activated when one of the eight Drosophila insulin-like peptides
  (dILPs) binds to their sole receptor, Drosophila insulin receptor (dInR). Downstream
  of the insulin receptor substrate CHICO, activation of the PI3K/protein kinase B
  (Akt) phosphorylation cascade inhibits the transcription factor dFOXO, as well as
  the fly GSK3 ortholog Shaggy (Sgg), which in turn inhibits CncC, the fly ortholog
  of the prolongevity transcription factor NRF2. The Ras-Erk pathway is also activated
  downstream of CHICO, ultimately leading to the inhibition of the transcription factor
  Anterior open (Aop). (3) Under low-energy conditions, detected by an increase in
  the ratio of the adenosine nucleotides AMP and ADP to ATP, the kinase AMPK is activated
  and phosphorylates dFOXO at a different site. (4) Metformin induces upregulation
  of a bacterial transcriptional regulator, cAMP receptor protein (CRP), resulting
  in the production of the metabolite agmatine, which exerts prolongevity effects
  on the host
