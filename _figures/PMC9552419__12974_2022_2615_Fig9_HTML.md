caption: Summary scheme of the neuronal and immunological effects of SAFit2. SAFit2
  reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity of nerve-injured mice by enhancing the activity
  of the phosphatase calcineurin which diminishes the open probability of the TRPV1
  channel and subsequent the release of the neuropeptide CGRP. On the immunological
  side SAFit2 reduces the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway since it reduces
  the phosphorylation of the inhibitor complex IκBα and the p65 itself. In addition,
  SAFit2 reduces the infiltration of immune cells into DRGs and spinal cord as well
  as chemokine and cytokine levels in the respective tissues. In vitro, we also could
  confirm that SAFit2 reduces the migration of human and murine macrophages. The scheme
