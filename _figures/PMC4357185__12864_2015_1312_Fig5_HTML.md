caption: Molecular interaction and biological pathways networks of regulated proteins
  in liver tumours of EGF transgenic mice. Cytoscape 3.0.2 with plugins (see  section)
  are used to generate functionally grouped network of pathways. Grouping of significant
  pathway terms (p ≤ 0.05) were based on kappa score threshold of 0.4, initial group
  size of 2 and sharing group percentage of 50. The pathway network consisted of 47
  significantly regulated proteins involved in distinct pathways which are colour-coded.
  Note, the three individual terms are grey-coloured. Up and down-regulated proteins
  are coded as orange and green small discs, respectively.
