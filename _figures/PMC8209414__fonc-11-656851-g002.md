caption: Main pathways involved in the metabolic remodeling of metastatic cancer cells,
  pivotal for energy and biomass production. Metastatic cancer cells are metabolically
  more plastic than non-metastatic cancer cells, because they need to survive in primary
  tumor microenvironment, and they must also prosper in the microenvironment of the
  metastasized organ. Glycolysis is a multi-step process, in which the expression
  of key glycolytic enzymes as hexokinase 2 (HK2) that converts glucose in glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) that promotes
  the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) in fructose-2,6-biphosphate (F2,6BP;
  an allosteric activator of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1)) and
  pyruvate by tumor M2-pyruvate kinase (PKM2) that synthesizes pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvic
  acid (PEP) have been showed to be involved in metastases establishment. Pyruvate
  is an endpoint product of glycolysis that after its conversion into acetyl-CoA,
  which can alternatively be produced from acetate, under the action of acyl-coenzyme
  A synthase short-chain family member 2 (ACSS2), then it will supply the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle or the synthesis of fatty acids (FA). Additionality, FA can be
  imported by CD36, being the FA pool deviated to FA b-oxidation (FAO). Glycolysis
  intermediate glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) can be diverged from glycolysis to supply
  phosphate pentose pathway (PPP) through the action of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD), catalyzing the conversion of G6P into glucono-1,5-lactone-6P (G1,5L6P) and
  generating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The 6-phosphogluconate
  dehydrogenase (6PGD) converts 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) into ribose-5-phosphate (R5P),
  concomitantly with NAPDH production. Amino acids metabolism is crucial in biosynthesis
  and bioenergetics. The serine and glycine syntheses and the one-carbon metabolism
  play a central role in cell metabolism. The action of serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) catalyzes the conversion of serine into glycine, generating NADPH. NAPDH
  will be essential for the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) into glutathione
  (GSH) by the action of glutathione reductase (GR). In turn, the oxidation of GSH
  in GSSG by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is essential for the control of the redox
  state of metastasizing cancer cells. Moreover, cysteine, glutamate and glycine are
  used in GSH synthesis. Glutamine catabolism through the action of glutaminase 1
  (GLS1) leads to the production of glutamate and ammonia (NH3). In turn, glutamate
  dehydrogenase 1 (GLDH1) converts glutamate into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) that will
  fulfill TCA cycle. In mitochondria, glutamate is a target of glutamic-oxaloacetic
  transaminase 2 (GOT-2), producing α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and aspartate, at the expense
  of oxaloacetate (OAA). In cytoplasm, the action of GOT-1, at the expense α-KG, leads
  to glutamate production that can be converted into proline by the action of proline
  dehydrogenase (PRODH). Moreover, pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PYCR) catalyzes
  the inverse reaction, leading to the conversion of proline into glutamate. Aspartate
  catabolism by asparagine synthetase (ASNS) promotes asparagine synthesis. Cysteine
  in cytoplasm is essential for GSH synthesis while in mitochondria, its catabolism
  by the cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) route; the cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) route
  and the CAT/GOT:3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) axis route leads to the
  production of pyruvate and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).
