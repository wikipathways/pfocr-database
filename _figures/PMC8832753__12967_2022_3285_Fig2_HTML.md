  the classical (Canonical) and the alternative (noncanonical) pathways, with transcription
  factors including NF-κB1 (P50 and its precursor P105), NF-κB2(P52 and its precursor
  P100), RelA (P65) RelB, and c-Rel. The alternative pathway is the major pathway
  for B cell survival through BAFF-R, characterized by the presence of IKK1 and P100
  phosphorylation cleaving to P52. The processed p52 heterodimerize with RelB, migrates
  to the nucleus, and induces transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. IKK1 is also
  phosphorylated by NIK. In unstimulated cells, TRAF3, TRAF2, and cIAPs1/2 factors
  are linked together, NIK is continuously destroyed by the proteasome, TRAF3, TRAF2,
  and cIAPs1/2 are factors for NIK ubiquitination and targeting it for degradation.
  After cell stimulation, TRAF3 is exposed to BAFF-R, which causes TRAF3 self-degradation
  by cIAPs 1/2 and TRAF2, this action leads to the stabilization of NIK and eventually
  causes cleavage of P100. The NF-κB alternative pathway is activated by the CD40
  receptor too, a member of the TNF family. The BCR on mature naive recirculating
  B cells is achieved by the association of Igα/Igβ heterodimer. The classic pathway

  of IKK2 by the TAB/TAK complex. IKK1 can contribute to the canonical IKK2/Nemo pathway,
  imparting important survival signals and it is also important in B cells for GC
  formation. recent studies show that the BCR induces p100 to facilitate BAFF-R signaling.
