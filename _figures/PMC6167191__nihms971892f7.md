caption: (A) Schizophrenia is associated with decreased spine densities (; ). Reduced
  levels of the NMDAR co-agonist, D-serine, and increased levels of the endogenous
  NMDAR D-serine binding site antagonist, kynurenic acid, have been reported in schizophrenic
  patients (; ; ). Limited access of the NMDAR to the obligatory co-agonist will result
  in reduced Ca2+-influx through the receptor and could cause a shift in the downstream
  signaling mechanisms favoring PP2B-dependent, and non-ionotropic NMDAR- and p38
  MAPK-dependent signaling towards spine shrinkage and synaptic depression. (B) Stress-induced
  depression is associated with decreased spine densities (). The NMDAR antagonist
  ketamine is a fast acting antidepressant, which rescues the stress-induced reduction
  in spine density (; ), possibly through inhibition of NMDARs (; ; ) or activation
  of AMPARs (), leading to increased BDNF levels and mTOR-dependent new spine formation
  (). (C) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with decreased spine densities ().
  Increased levels of oligomeric Aβ in AD cause NMDAR-dependent spine elimination

  description: (A) Schizophrenia is associated with decreased spine densities (; ).
    Reduced levels of the NMDAR co-agonist, D-serine, and increased levels of the
    endogenous NMDAR D-serine binding site antagonist, kynurenic acid, have been reported
    in schizophrenic patients (; ; ). Limited access of the NMDAR to the obligatory

    a shift in the downstream signaling mechanisms favoring PP2B-dependent, and non-ionotropic
    NMDAR- and p38 MAPK-dependent signaling towards spine shrinkage and synaptic depression.
    (B) Stress-induced depression is associated with decreased spine densities ().
    The NMDAR antagonist ketamine is a fast acting antidepressant, which rescues the
    stress-induced reduction in spine density (; ), possibly through inhibition of
    NMDARs (; ; ) or activation of AMPARs (), leading to increased BDNF levels and

    with decreased spine densities (). Increased levels of oligomeric Aβ in AD cause
    NMDAR-dependent spine elimination and synaptic depression, which does not require
    ion influx through the receptor (; ), but leads to activation of p38 MAPK ().
    Inhibition of caspase-3 activity also blocks Aβ-induced dendritic spine shrinkage
    and loss (; ). Inset shows the caspase-dependent signaling pathway during LTD.
    (D) Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is associated with immature spine morphology and
    increased spine densities due to dysfunctional spine elimination mechanisms ().
    In Fragile X syndrome, loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) function
    prevents spine elimination that is driven by the activity-induced transcription
