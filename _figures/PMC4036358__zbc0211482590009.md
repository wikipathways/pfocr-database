caption: The hypothesized model for the signal pathway involved in the ChREBP-induced
  lipogenesis and fibrosis in mesangial cells under high glucose. In mesangial cells,
  high glucose-induced ChREBP O-GlcNAcylation enhanced the ChREBP level, transcriptional
  activity, stability, and nuclear localization. This, in turn, triggered its target
  protein signaling, especially that of lipogenic proteins and fibrosis-inducing proteins,
  which may render mesangial cells susceptible to hyperglycemia.
