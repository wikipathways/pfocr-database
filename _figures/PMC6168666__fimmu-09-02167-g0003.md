caption: Schematic overview of intracellular pathways involving CARD14/CARMA2 variants
  in keratinocytes. In the skin, CARMA2-mediated signals are prompted by intracellular
  organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, and by surface receptors, such as Toll-Like
  Receptors (TLRs) and IL17-Receptor (IL17R) in response to Pathogen Associated Membrane
  Patterns (PAMPs) and IL17, respectively. While CARMA2cl would act as a natural negative
  regulator, CARMA2sh and CARMA2fl variants interact with BCL10 and MALT1, thereby
  forming CBM complex. In turn, CBM triggers a canonical NEMO-dependent NF-κB-activation
  pathway, mediated by the IκB Kinase complex (IKK complex), which leads to expression
  of target genes in the nucleus, such as keratins, antimicrobial compounds and inflammatory
  mediators. Negative and positive regulators of CARMA2sh identified so far are also
  reported in the figure.
