caption: The scheme of the putative polar lipids and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) synthesis
  pathway in Fistulifera solaris. The plastid in this strain is considered to be surrounded
  by four membranes. Fatty acids and the prokaryotic lipids are de novo synthesized
  in the primary plastid. The eukaryotic lipids are de novo synthesized in the endoplasmic
  reticulum. The EPA was synthesized through the sequential desaturation of C18 fatty
  acid on PC. The acyl-editing and head group exchange processes on PC could not only
  provide EPA-CoA and EPA containing DAGs for the synthesis of other EPA-containing
  lipids but also promote the synthesis of the PC species maintain two C16 fatty acids.
  TAG in this figure is specified as the EPA-containing prokaryotic TAG. Arrow-headed
  lines represent synthesis, while dashed arrow-headed line represents transportation.
