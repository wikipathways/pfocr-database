caption: (A) Model of extracellular signals that function as cues for OPC differentiation
  through the activation of Akt in the Akt/mTOR pathway. Neuregulin is a canonical
  extracellular factor that triggers the activation of Akt/mTOR in oligodendrocytes
  to drive differentiation, and several other pro-differentiation extracellular factors
  have recently been found to also activate Akt. Akt is activated through phosphorylation
  at threonine 308 by the upstream PI3K pathway, and is further phosphorylated at
  serine 473 by mTORC2. Activated Akt regulates mTORC1 by inhibiting the TSC1/TSC2
  complex which inhibits mTORC1 activation by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor.
  (B) While activation of Akt can be achieved by extracellular signaling, intracellular
  regulation functions to internally control Akt/mTOR activity. Cholesterol, an important
  component of the oligodendrocyte membrane, and mTOR are dependent on each other
  and mTOR may signal through cholesterol-rich signaling domains for differentiation.
  Akt and Erk1/2 signaling converge on mTORC1 to drive myelination. Activation and
  regulation of mTOR activity ultimately impacts downstream targets that function
  in the cellular activities necessary for differentiation, such as downregulation
  of BMP signaling and actin polymerization. Bars indicate inhibitory activity; arrows
  indicate activation or positive interaction. Gray arrows indicate possible protein
  interactions that remain uncharacterized in oligodendrocytes.
