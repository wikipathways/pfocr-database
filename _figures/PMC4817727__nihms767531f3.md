caption: Role of axin in Wnt signaling in bone. (A) In the absence of Wnt ligands,
  β-catenin is constructively targeted for degradation via a multiprotein destruction
  complex. β-Catenin is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and then targeted for ubiquitination
  (Ub) and proteosomal degradation. Axin plays a key role in this process of β-catenin
  degradation and thus functions as an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt-β pathway. (B)
  Binding of canonical Wnt ligands to their co-receptors Fz and LRP5/6 prevent β-catenin
  phosphorylation by GSK-3β, which in turn prevent its degradation and allows it to
  move to the nucleus to mediate gene expression.
