caption: 'Overview of metabolic pathways involved in oil palm seed germination showing
  the role of the haustorium. For clarity, this figure does not show all intermediates,
  transporters and possible metabolic routes, and does not recall time windows for
  reserve utilization (shown in ). Enzymes discussed in text are in bold grey. Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitigation is shown in red. Coenzyme A cycle
  and synthesis are shown in light blue. Sucrose synthesis from galactomannanes degradation
  is shown in thick black arrows. Abbreviations: 2OIV, 2-oxoisovalerate; ACBP, acyl-CoA
  binding proteins; βEM, β-endomannanases; FABP, fatty acid binding proteins; FAs,
  fatty acids; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; TAG, triacylglycerols; TCAP, tricarboxylic
  acid pathway; UDPG, UDP-glucose. Here, oil bodies are shown as comprising oleosins
  (see further discussion in main text).'
