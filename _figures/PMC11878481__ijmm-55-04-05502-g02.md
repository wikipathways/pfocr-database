caption: Impact of macrophage mitochondrial autophagy on fibrotic diseases. When mitochondrial
  injury occurs, PINK1 accumulates at the outer mitochondrial membrane, facilitating
  the recruitment and activation of Parkin. Parkin activation mediates ubiquitination
  of mitochondrial substrates and induces mitochondrial autophagy. Activated PINK1/Parkin
  can promote autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated proteins by mediating the attachment
  of ubiquitinated substrates to LC3 via specific ligand proteins (e.g., p62). The
  ubiquitinated mitochondria are engulfed by autophagosomes. After fusion of autophagosomes
  with lysosomes, lysosomal hydrolases are able to degrade autophagosomal contents.
  Macrophage mitochondria undergo autophagy through the PINK1-Parkin pathway. Mitochondrial
  autophagy inhibits ROS production in macrophages. ROS inhibit macrophage differentiation
  toward a pro-fibrotic/M2 phenotype, thereby reducing extracellular matrix accumulation
  and ameliorating fibrosis. LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain
  3; ROS, reactive oxygen species; USP19, ubiquitin-specific protease 19; PINK1, PTEN-induced
  putative kinase 1
