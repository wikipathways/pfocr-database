caption: Mutant SOD aggregates inhibition ETC signaling and autophagy via ERK/STAT3
  signaling and Atg12 suppression, respectively. Autophagy suppression leads to neuronal
  cell death. ETC Electron transport chain, ERK Extracellular signal-regulated kinase,
  STAT3 signal transducer and activator of transcription,- Atg12 Autophagy related
  gene 12, TPSO Translocator protein. Double-sided orange rectangle represents a molecular
  pathway within a cell; black arrow represents signal propagation; red flat arrow
  represents inhibition of signal propagation; small dark blue rectangle represents
  a protein or enzyme; small pink rectangle represents mutated protein/enzyme; and,
  purple lozenge represents mRNA
