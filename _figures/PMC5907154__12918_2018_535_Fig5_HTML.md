caption: 'A case study for PPI where one direction is activation and the other is
  inhibition. HRAS activates MAPK1 in axon guidance, whereas MAPK1 inhibits HRAS in
  neutrophin signaling pathway. Both effect types were correctly predicted in 10-fold
  cross validation, showing that our method can predict sign for each direction independently.
  Positive/negative regulation pairs that contributed to the sign prediction are shown
  in the figure. Interestingly, ‘negative regulation of cell differentiation’ and
  ‘cell differentiation’ were used to predict the inhibition, which is related to
  the function of neutrophin signaling pathway. Abbreviations: HRAS, hras proto-oncogene,
  GTPase; MAPK1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1'
