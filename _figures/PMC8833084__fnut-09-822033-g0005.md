caption: The changed metabolic pathways due to S. cerevisiae fermentation in B. napus
  bee pollen based on KEGG pathway analysis. The red frame represented that the content
  of those highlighted metabolites was significantly increased in the fermented bee
  pollen compared to the unfermented bee pollen. The color bar from blue to red indicated
  the metabolite level from low to high.
