caption: Ciliary disassembly mechanism. a A schematic representation of ciliary resorption
  versus ciliary excision. b The core axis of ciliary disassembly is regulated through
  the NEDD9/AURKA/HDAC6 pathway that drives ciliary resorption. This axis can be stimulated
  by the mitochondria, extracellular WNT signalling and cell cycle regulators. The
  criteria for a protein to be considered a ciliary resorption protein, and to be
  included in this schematic overview, the protein has to influence ciliary length
  during disassembly, but is not involved in ciliary excision or budding. All of these
  proteins with a confirmed role in ciliary resorption are shown in blue. In addition
  to these, proteins shown in grey and with dotted lines indicate known interactors
  of these resorption proteins, but which have not yet been investigated in the context
  of ciliary resorption specifically. PLK1 both stimulates and inhibits ciliary resorption
  by phosphorylation of a wide variety of targets. The APC/C stimulates ciliary resorption
  when activated by CDC20. For CENPJ, the exact role in ciliary resorption remains
  elusive
