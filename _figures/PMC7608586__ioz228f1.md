caption: Simplified schematic of GpHR complex signaling. FSHR and LHR G protein-dependent
  and independent pathway activation through receptor–receptor interactions, receptor–G
  signaling protein interactions, and receptor–adapter/scaffolding protein interactions.
  Dashed lines represent currently hypothesized/unresolved mechanisms of pathway activation
  and/or cross talk, blunt ended arrows, inhibitory pathways and spear-headed arrows,
  activated pathways. The FSHR and LHR are represented as single receptors for simplicity,
  but from our current knowledge they reside as both homomers and monomers.
