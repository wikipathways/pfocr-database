caption: Cellular response to stress via O-GlcNAc-dependent epigenetic regulation.
  The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway incorporates nutrients and intermediate metabolites
  to form the nucleotide sugar UDP-GlcNAc. The O-GlcNAc Transferase (OGT) utilizes
  this nucleotide sugar as the sugar donor to modify diverse nucleocytoplasmic proteins
  including transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and histones. This modification
  can be removed by O-GlcNAcase (OGA), whose levels are also implicated in regulation
  of gene expression. The process of O-GlcNAc cycling enables the cell to sense and
  integrate nutrient and signaling information and respond to extracellular stressors.
  O-GlcNAc influences histone modifications through the interactions of OGT with the
  Polycomb complex and SET1/COMPASS, OGA’s interactions with the trithorax complex,
  and direct O-GlcNAcylation of histones. OGT associates with TRIM28 to induce DNA
  methylation-dependent repression, and OGT is also involved in demethylation of DNA
  through the TET proteins. O-GlcNAc influences transcription by modification of transcription
  factors and the C-terminal domain of RNA Polymerase II. O-GlcNAc is also involved
  in the DNA damage response.
