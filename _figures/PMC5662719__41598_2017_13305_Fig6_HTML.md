caption: Schematic working hypothesis. It has been demonstrated local RAAS is activated
  in lung tissue of fibrosis. AngII binds with AT1R in lung fibroblasts to enhance
  the expression level of mir-21, the recognized pro-fibrotic factor. Mir-21 promotes
  ERK phosphorylation and NF-κB nuclei translocation by targeting Spry1 degradation,
  following NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The released proinflammatory factors (Caspase-1/IL-1)
  by the inflammasome pathway lead to a-colllagen I synthesis and apoptosis resisitance.
  ACE2 degrades AngII to produce Ang(1–7), which reverses the AngII’s profibrotic
  effect via downregulating mir-21. As a result, mir-21 and NLRP3 inflammasome play
  a key in local RAAS imbalance induced lung fibrosis.
