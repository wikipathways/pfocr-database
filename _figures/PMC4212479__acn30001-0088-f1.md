caption: 'Overview of sphingolipid metabolism. Ceramide is at the central hub of sphingolipid
  metabolism and is synthesized de novo from serine and palmitoyl-CoA. In the third
  step of this four-step process, ceramide synthases acylate dihydro-sphingosine (dHSphingosine)
  to form dihydro-ceramide (dHCeramide). Six mammalian ceramide synthases (CERS1-6)
  (shown in red) have been identified and each of these utilizes a unique subset of
  acyl-CoAs (indicated beneath each CERS). Once formed, ceramide can be metabolized
  in five different ways: (1) Ceramide can be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase (CERK).
  (2) Ceramide can be glycosylated by galactosylceramide (GalCer) synthase producing
  GalCer which can be further metabolized into sulfatides. (3) Attachment of phosphocholine
  to ceramide yields sphingomyelin (SM) in a reaction catalyzed by SM synthase (SMS).
  (4) Glycosylation of ceramide by glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase followed by
  galactosyltransferase I (GalTI) produces GlcCer and lactosylceramide (LacCer), respectively.
  LacCer constitute the foundation for the synthesis of more complex glycosphingolipids
  including gangliosides GM1 and GM3. (5) Ceramide can be degraded to sphingosine,
  which in turn can be phosphorylated to sphingosine 1-phosphate (sphingosine1P) and
  further degraded into hexadecanal and ethanolamine 1-phosphate (ethanolamine1P).
  The last step is the only known exit route from the sphingolipid pathway. SPT, serine
