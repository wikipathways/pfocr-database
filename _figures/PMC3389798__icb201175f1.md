caption: 'EP receptors: types and signalling. The four different EP receptors are
  high-affinity G-protein coupled receptors characterized by the activation of different
  signalling pathways. EP2 and EP4 are linked to Gαs proteins and function by inducing
  the adenylate cyclase (AC) system and concomitant increases in the secondary messenger
  cAMP. cAMP acts by activating PKA, resulting in the dissociation of the regulatory
  and catalytic subunits of the kinase. The catalytic subunits initiate the corresponding
  transactivation of the transcription factor CREB. EP4 is also capable of activating
  the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway by phosphorylation induced
  by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases. This ultimately results in the triggering
  of NF-κB-mediated transcription programs. EP3 isoforms differ in their ability to
  modulate signal transduction. EP3α and EP3β are capable of blocking induction of
  AC while EP3γ potentiates AC and cAMP production. EP1, on the other hand, couples
  to Gαq protein and signals through the phospholipase C (PLC)/inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) pathway resulting in the formation of the second messengers diacylglycerol
  (DAG) and IP3, with the latter rapidly liberating Ca2+ ions from intracellular stores.'
