caption: LPAR3 regulates EPO induction by hypoxia. In hypoxic cells, LPAR3 is activated
  by LPA or its agonist OMPT, resulting in PI3K-Akt pathway activation, which contributes
  to the stabilization of HIF-2α. The stabilized HIF-2α subsequently translocates
  into the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with HIF-β to bind with the HRE (HIF-responsive
  element) in the Epo promoter for transcriptional activation of the Epo gene. The
  induction of EPO by hypoxia is suppressed by treatment with the LPAR1/3 inhibitor
  Ki16425 or LY294002, a pan-PI3K inhibitor
