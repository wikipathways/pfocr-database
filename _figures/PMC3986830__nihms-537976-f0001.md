caption: A. RB mediated repression of the activator E2Fs is relieved after cells pass
  the restriction point. Cyclins D and E in complex with cyclin dependent kinases
  (CDKs) relieve RB-mediated repression of E2F. The activator E2Fs including E2F1,
  E2F2 and E2F3 contribute to expression of the early cell cycle genes during the
  G1 to S phase transition (green arrow). RB may restrict E2F dependent gene expression
  during DNA damage signalling or oncogene-induced senescence. The classic model of
  the RB-E2F pathway depicted here does not account for the expression of G2/M late
  cell cycle genes (blue arrow) during G2/M. Perturbations in RB control of E2F activity
  occur in most cancer types and include inactivating mutations of the RB gene itself,
  increased CDK activity due to overexpression of cyclins D and E or loss of FBXW7,
  decreased expression of CDK inhibitors such as p16INK4a and p21, or expression of
  viral cyclins such as KSHV viral cyclin that binds to cellular CDKs and renders
  them resistant to inhibition by CDK inhibitors , . In addition, the viral oncoproteins,
  papilloma virus E7, polyomavirus large T antigen or adenovirus E1A can bind to RB
  and dissociate it from E2F.B. The central role of the MuvB core in binding and directing
  key transcription factors to the promoters of cell cycle genes during various cell
  cycle phases. MuvB binds p130-E2F4-DP to form DREAM in G0 and repress all cell cycle
  dependent gene expression. Association of the MuvB core with p130-E2F4 is dependent
  on DYRK1A-mediated phosphorylation of the MuvB subunit, LIN52. The MuvB core sequentially
  recruits BMYB during S phase and then FOXM1 to the promoters of the G2/M genes.
  In all three instances, the MuvB core is essential for targeting the complexes to
  specific sets of cell cycle gene promoters.
