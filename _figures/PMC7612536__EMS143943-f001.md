caption: 'Data from key studies {(i), Rossi et al. []; (ii), El-Brolosy et al. [];
  (iii), Ma et al. []; (iv), Serobyan et al. []} have helped build a basic framework
  for transcriptional adaptation: a frameshift mutation in gene X can activate the
  transcription of similar genes in trans [,,,]. This activation is not dependent
  on loss of protein activity as transcriptional [,,,] or translational [] inhibition
  of gene X, or dominant negative alleles [], do not trigger this response. The mRNA
  quality control (QC) mechanism of the cell determines whether an mRNA is used for
  protein production or is recycled [,,]. If not used for translation, mRNAs can also
  enter the transcriptional adaptation pathway, either repurposed as long noncoding
  RNAs [] or by contributing small degradation intermediates [,]. Different processes
  have been implicated in transcriptional adaptation, either upstream or downstream
  of the QC step [,,]. Better understanding of the crosstalk between these processes
  will help explain different transcriptional adaptation responses and allow modulation
  of this pathway. Abbreviation: PTC, premature termination codon.'
