caption: Major pathways involved in neurological diseases with confirmed or suspected
  neuroinflammation – tryptophan–kynurenine pathway (right above), nitric oxide pathway
  (left bottom), neopterin (right bottom) and sphingolipid–ceramide pathway (left
  above). Trends are highlighted in red (representing statistically elevated in patients
  with neuroinflammation compared with controls) and blue (representing statistically
  decreased in patients with neuroinflammation compared with controls). Neopterin
  is the most valuable inflammatory metabolite in the GTP–tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism;
  therefore, the full pathway is not shown. 3‐HAO, 3‐hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase;
  ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; CerS, ceramide synthase; DEGS, dihydroceramide
  desaturase; GTPCH I, guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I; IDO, indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase;
  IFN‐γ, interferon‐gamma; KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO, kynurenine monooxygenase;
  KSR, ketosphinganine reductase; KYNU, kynureninase; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric
  oxide synthase; SMases, sphingomyelinases; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; TDO,
  tryptophan 2,3‐dioxygenase.
