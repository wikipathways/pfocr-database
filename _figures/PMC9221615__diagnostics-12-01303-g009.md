  cofactor in several processes of the intermediate metabolism. As a consequence of
  an enzyme impairment in the pathway of heme biosynthesis, -aminolevulinic acid and
  porphobilinogen accumulate: -aminolevulinic acid, in particular, self-reacts in
  the presence of iron, to yield ROS and dioxovaleric acid, a highly reactive oxidant.
  This is deemed one of the main mechanisms which cause tissue damage in acute porphyrias.
  Nitric oxide synthases, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, cystathionine -synthase, and

  expression at a translational level; additionally, cyclic guanosine monophoshate
  has inhibitory effects on the signaling pathway which starts from endothelin receptors.
  Nitric oxide synthases require tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as a cofactor. In conditions
  of BH4 deficiency, “uncoupled” reactions may yield peroxynitrite, a highly reactive
