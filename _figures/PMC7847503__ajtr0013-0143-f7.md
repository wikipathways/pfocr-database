caption: Summarized molecular mechanisms of the signaling pathway involving the EGFR,
  TrkB, KRAS HIF-1α and VEGF-A genes; adapted from [,]. 1) Phosphorylation resulting
  from BDNF/TrkB binding can also activate KRAS; however, TrkB gene expression was
  not found in either subpopulation. This suggests that only EGFR is activating the
  KRAS gene. 2) Phosphorylation resulting from EGFR/EGF binding activates KRAS, which
  leads to cell proliferation. The results of our present and previous studies showed
  high KRAS and EGFR expression in the CSC subpopulation []. 3) Only cetuximab []
  binds with EGFR, which blocks EGFR/EGF binding; we suggest that this isolated treatment
  does not inhibit KRAS inactivation. 4) KRAS gene can active HIF1α and consequently
  VEGF-A. In this study, these genes were highly expressed in the CSC subpopulation.
  5) VEGF-A/VEGFR binding can activate KRAS by the PCLy pathway leading to vascular
  proliferation. Created with BioRender.com.
