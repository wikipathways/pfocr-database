caption: 'Under the unstressed condition, p53 is ubiquitylated by MDM2 and other E3
  ligases and subsequently degraded by the proteasome machinery. Under stressed conditions,
  p53 is activated and post-translationally modified. Some of these modifications
  prevent p53 from E3-mediated degradation and increase the steady-state levels of
  p53. Activated p53 binds to chromatin and regulates transcription of its targets,
  which mediates various cellular functions of p53. These cellular functions are thought
  to contribute to the tumor suppressive function of p53. Red lollipops: post-translational
  modifications (PTMs); Blue beads on a string: nucleosomes.'
