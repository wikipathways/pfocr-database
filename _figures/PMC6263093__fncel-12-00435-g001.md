caption: 'Schematic representation of APP processing and the cellular localization
  of the different secretases involved. (A) Following synthesis and maturation, the
  amyloid precursor protein (APP) can classically follow two different pathways: the
  non-amyloidogenic or the amyloidogenic pathways, the latest being at the origin
  of Aβ peptides production. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is first cleaved
  by α-secretase (mallow) within the Aβ sequence, liberating a soluble fragment sAPPα
  and a transmembrane carboxy-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) called α-CTF. Then, γ-secretase
  (turquoise) processes α-CTF into p3 and APP intracellular domain (AICD). In the
  amyloidogenic pathway, sAPPβ and β-CTF are released following APP cleavage by β-secretase
  (red). β-CTF is further processed by γ-secretase into Aβ peptide and AICD. (B) Alternatively
  to a direct cleavage by α- or β-secretase, APP can be processed by other secretases
  that have been recently described. Meprin β (brown) can act as an alternative β-secretase
  releasing sAPPβ with 1 amino acid longer and β-CTF with an amino acid less. β-CTF-1
  is similarly cleaved by γ-secretase. η-secretase (orange) cleaves APP into sAPPη
  and η-CTF. η-CTF can follow either the amyloidogenic or the non-amyloidogenic pathway,
  releasing Aη-β and β-CTF or Aη-α and α-CTF, respectively. The remaining CTFs (α-
  and β-) are likely processed by γ-secretase. δ-secretase (green) processes APP into
  sAPPδ and δ-CTF. Cleavage of δ-CTF by β- and γ-secretase releases Aβ and AICD. (C)
  All these secretases are active in different cellular compartments. Thus, we propose
  a schematic representation of their spatial location for APP cleavage in agreement
  with the literature. α-secretase and meprin β were described to cleave APP at the
  cell surface where α-CTF and β-CTF-1 can then be processed by γ-secretase (; ; ).
  γ-secretase cleavage was reported to occur at the plasma membrane and in endosomes
  (). β-secretase processing of APP is reported to occur in endosomal/lysosomal acidic
  compartments as it is the case for the δ-secretase (; ) where APP-CTFs could also
  be cleaved by γ-secretase. The location of APP processing by η-secretase is still
  unclear but it is likely that η-secretase is located at the plasma membrane and
  also improves APP localization to endosomes (, ). Figure was produced in part using
