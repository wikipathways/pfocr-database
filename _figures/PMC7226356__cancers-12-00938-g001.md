caption: 'The perforin-granzyme, intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway. The extrinsic pathway is triggered via ligation of cell surface death receptors
  from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family with death ligands (e.g., FAS
  ligand or TNFα) on the outside of the cell membrane. Subsequently, a multiprotein
  complex: death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) is created on the cytosolic side
  of the cell membrane resulting in activation of pro-caspase 8. The initiator caspase
  8 subsequently activates the effector caspases (caspase-3 and 7), that cleave cellular
  proteins and promotes the apoptotic machinery. The perforin-granzyme and intrinsic
  apoptotic pathways are described in the text.'
