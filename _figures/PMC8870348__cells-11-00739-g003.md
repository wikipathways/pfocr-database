caption: Principles of co-targeting pyrimidine de novo synthesis and salvage pathways.
  (A) Simultaneous targeting of pyrimidine uptake with dipyridamole and DHODH with
  brequinar. (B) Targeting of both, RNR via allosteric inhibition with TTP synthesized
  via dT addition, and dCK with DI-39. (C) RNR inhibition with gemcitabine or hydroxyurea
  results in non-allosteric inhibition of the ara-CTPase SAMHD1 leading to an increase
  in ara-CTP DNA incorporation. (D) CTPS inhibition with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC)
  leads to an increase in dCK activity followed by increased ara-CTP DNA incorporation.
  (E) dTTP synthesis inhibition via co-targeting of TS with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
  or pemetrexed and siRNA knockdown of TK1/2. (F) Chemical structures of CPEC (1),
  hydroxyurea (2), and pemetrexed (3). Solid arrows represent direct steps in the
  pathway. Dashed arrows display multiple steps leading to metabolite synthesis. Created
