caption: Effect of intestinal microorganisms on the mucosal immune system. MAMP = microbe-associated
  molecular pattern; LPS = lipopolysaccharide. Intestinal microbial signals such as
  flagellin can promote the secretion of the antibacterial protein regenerating islet-derived
  III (RegIII)γ by intestinal epithelial cells through activation of the toll-like
  receptors myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (TLR-MyD88) signaling pathway.
  This promotes the repair of damaged intestinal epithelial cells. Segmented filamentous
  bacteria (SFB) can induce the expression of serum amyloid A (SAA) in the small intestine,
  thus promoting the differentiation of Th17 cells. In addition, SFB can induce intestinal
  innate lymphoid cell 3 (ILC3) to produce interleukin (IL)-22, induce epithelial
  expression of SAA, and promote the expression of IL-17 in Th17 cells. B. fragilis
  and Clostridial spp. Can induce regulatory T cells (Treg) differentiation. Butyrate,
  the product of bacteria fermentation of dietary fiber, induces the expression of
  IL-18 in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) through G protein-coupled receptor 109
  A (GPR109A) signaling. In addition, butyric acid can also promote the anti-inflammatory
  properties of colon dendritic cells through GPR109A signaling, enabling them to
  induce the differentiation of Treg cells and IL-10-producing CD4+ T cell cells.
