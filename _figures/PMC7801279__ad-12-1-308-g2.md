caption: Drugs treat VaD through regulating inflammation-related signaling pathways.
  There are several inflammation-related pathways involved in neuroinflammation of
  VaD, which can be used as pharmacological targets. The NF-κB signaling is a core
  pathway among these inflammation-related pathways. Some drugs such as ReA, PF, Fructus
  mume, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and RAD001 can act directly on NF-κB or its upstream
  molecules, thereby inhibiting the pro-inflammatory pathways, reducing expression
  of inflammatory cytokines, suppressing the activation of glia and promoting the
  polarization of M1/M2. These effects are beneficial to the cognitive improvement
  of VaD. Other inflammation-related signaling pathways, such as NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β
  and MAPK signaling could be inhibited by DY-9836 and HRT respectively. Hence, these
  drugs can exert a neuroprotective effect on VaD.
