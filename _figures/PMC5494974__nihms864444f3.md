caption: Cyclin D/Cdks are activated in response to mitogenic signals and initiate
  phosphorylation of Rb, a process that is completed by cyclin E - Cdk2. Once cells
  enter the S phase, cyclin E is degraded and cyclin A enters into complexes with
  Cdk2. Proteins of the Ink4 family (p15, p16, p18, p19) bind only to Cdk4 and inhibit
  its activity while those in the Kip/Cip family (p21, p27, p57) inhibit cyclin-bound
  Cdks (–). Both p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 act as an assembly factor (AF; ref. ). Arf is
  induced by potentially oncogenic signals stemming from overexpression of oncogenes
  such as c-Myc, E2F1, and activated Ras, which quenches inappropriate mitogenic signaling
  by diverting incipient cancer cells to undergo p53-dependent growth arrest or cell
  death (, ). Dmp1 is activated by oncogenic Ras or HER2, which, in turn, binds and
  activates the Arf promoter and induces cell cycle arrest (, ). Three different splicing
  variants have been reported for human DMP1 (, ). Dmp1 (Dmp1α) directly binds to
  the CD13 () and Arf () promoters to transactivate the gene expression, thereby accelerates
  myeloid cell differentiation by interfering cell cycle progression. Interestingly
  the CD13 promoter activation is inhibited by D-type cyclins in a Cdk-independent
  fashion (, ; see the dotted line for inhibition) while the Arf promoter activation
  is stimulated by cyclin D1 () in a Cdk-dependent fashion (, ). Other transcriptional
  targets for Dmp1α include Areg, Thbp-1, JunB, and Egr1 (), suggesting that it is
  also involved in signal transduction related to angiogenesis and/or metastasis.
  Dmp1α physically interacts with p53 and neutralizes all the activities of Mdm2 to
  activate the p53 pathway (, ). Both Dmp1−/− and Dmp1+/− mice show hypersensitivity
  to develop tumors in response to carcinogen or γ-irradiation. E2F1-3a (, ) directly
  binds to the Dmp1 promoter and causes transcriptional repression (). The Dmp1 promoter
  is repressed by NF-κB through direct binding of the promoter to RelA (). Conversely,
  the Dmp1 promoter is activated by the oncogenic Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK-Jun pathway () and
  HER2-Pi3k-Akt-NF-κB (), and thus Ras or HER2-driven carcinogenesis is dramatically
  accelerated in Dmp1-null mice. The transcription factor AML1 locus is frequently
  translocated to create hybrid molecules in human acute leukemias, and plays essential
  roles in normal hematopoiesis through dimerization of its partner CBFβ (, ). Direct
  transcriptional activation of the ARF promoter by AML1 and its inhibition by AML1-ETO
  has been reported (). 53BP1 is a p53-binding protein, and is involved in DNA-damage
  response by choosing recombination and end joining at DNA double-strand breaks (–).
  Haploid insufficiency of p27Kip1, p53, 53BP1, Dmp1α, Arf, AML1, and Egr1 TSGs are
  discussed in this review. These genes are shown in bold. The DMP1 locus generates
  other two splice variants, namely DMP1β and γ, and the oncogenic role of DMP1β has
  recently been demonstrated in vivo (–). Aberrant splicing of TSGs and their roles
  in carcinogenesis are currently extensively studied (, –), which can further affect
  the function of the remaining allele of haploinsufficient TSGs. Proteins that have
  mitogenic/oncogenic functions are shown in dark while those with tumor-suppressive
  activities are shown in white.
