caption: 'KEGG classification of the DEGs in the B. licheniformis CBBD302 response
  to ammonia. (A) The top 20 pathways enriched in KEGG classification after incubation
  with ammonia; (B) The changes of transcription level of ammonium metabolism related
  coding genes, short up-arrow: indicates that the marked gene was upregulated while
  the short down arrow means the marked gene was downregulated; gene pruF was not
  changed; *The embedded box illustrates the downstream pathway of L-glutamate.'
