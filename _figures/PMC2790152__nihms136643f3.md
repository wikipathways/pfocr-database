caption: A model of the inhibitor of growth (ING) 2 signaling pathway. (a) In normal
  cells, retinol binding protein (RBP) 1 may allow recruitment of the mSin3–histone
  deacetylase (HDAC) complex by retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins to induce
  cell cycle arrest by repressing E2F-dependent transcription and DNA replication
  origins. The tumor suppressor p53 also monitors abnormal cell proliferation through
  suppression of genes associates with cell proliferation, including ING2 (ING2a).
  (b) In cancer cells, upregulated ING2 may recruit sirtuin (SIRT) 1 to the RBP1–mSin3–HDAC
  complex. The recruited SIRT1 may inhibit RBP1-associated mSin3A–HDAC1 activity,
  leading to activation of E2F. The activated E2F may promote cell proliferation.
  Upregulated ING2 (ING2a) may suppress p53 functions to facilitate exacerbation of
  cancers.
