caption: Sirtuin-mediated protein deacetylation requries NAD+. Overview of the sirtuin
  deacetylation reaction and the NAD+ salvage pathway. Sirtuins deacetylate their
  target proteins at specific lysine residues. This reaction is dependent on the availability
  of NAD+, which serves as a cosubstrate, thereby integrating cellular energy and
  redox state with multiple signaling and survival pathways. The reaction results
  in the formation of a deacetylated protein, NAM, and 2′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, and
  is inhibited by NAM. The salvage pathway (red arrows) is used to regenerate NAD+
  from NAM. NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway, converts NAM to NMN,
  followed by conversion of NMN to NAD+ by NMNAT.
