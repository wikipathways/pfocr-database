caption: RTK/RAF/MAPK signaling in melanoma and its effects on immune cell activity.
  Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) upregulation enhances the RAF/MAPK pathway, leading
  to increased TGF-β secretion by melanoma cells. TGF-β promotes the transition of
  CD4+ T cells to regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the polarization of M1 to M2 tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs), facilitating tumor progression and immune evasion. Additionally,
  immune checkpoints PD-L1 and CD80/CD86 on melanoma cells bind to their counterparts
  PD-1 and CTLA4, respectively, to suppress immune cell activity against tumor cells.
  Consequently, immunotherapies targeting these immune checkpoints can significantly
  improve the treatment of melanoma
