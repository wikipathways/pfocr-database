caption: Working model of the innate immune response to papillomavirus infection of
  the female lower genital tract. (A) Papillomaviruses (PV) infect keratinocytes and
  activate innate immunity via a yet-to-be-identified TLR and the release of preformed
  pro-IL-1α. Signaling through the MyD88-dependent pathways of the TLR and IL-1R leads
  to the expression of interferon (IFN) and the chemokine CCL20. IFN binds to the
  IFN receptor and signals through the STAT1-dependent IFN pathway to induce the expression
  of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that block late viral gene expression at the
  transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. (B) CCL20 recruits CCR6-expressing
  tissue-resident or recruited myeloid or lymphoid cells that clear papillomavirus-infected
  dysplastic epithelial cells. Papillomaviruses may also directly activate dendritic
  cells to secrete CCL20.
