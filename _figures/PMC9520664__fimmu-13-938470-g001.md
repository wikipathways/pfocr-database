caption: Illustration of VSIG4 functions. In host defense against bloodstream infections,VSIG4
  recognizes C3b and helps macrophages phagocytose C3b- or iC3b-tagged pathogens (bacteria,
  viruses, fungi, etc.). In a variety of complement activation-dependent inflammatory
  diseases, VSIG4 delivers anti-inflammatory signals by binding C3b to prevent the
  alternative pathway of complement activation. VSIG4 also inhibits macrophage M1
  activation by regulating inflammasome activation and pyruvate metabolism. VSIG4
  also inhibits T-cell activation, proliferation, and IL-2 production upon binding
  to an unknown ligand on T cells.
