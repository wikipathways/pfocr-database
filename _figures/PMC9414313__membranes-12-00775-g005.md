caption: Exosomes from tumors have related proteins that can mediate homologous targeting
  on the surface. After loading CuB and PTX-S-LA into the exosomes. The exosomes can
  achieve targeted capture of homologous proteins with CTCs after intravenous injection
  into the blood. After exosome uptake by CTCs, CuB targeted FAK/MMP pathway in CTCs
  is released to inhibit tumor metastasis, and ROS is also released, which promotes
  sequential activation of PTX-S-LA and releases PTX to inhibit tumor growth.
