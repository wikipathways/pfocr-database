caption: 'The metabolic pathway and strain information for the co-production of isoprene
  and lactate: (A) Mevalonate (MVA) is produced by the upstream fermentation from
  glucose; isoprene and lactate are co-produced by the downstream fermentation from
  MVA and glucose substrates. (B) Construction of the co-production strains carrying
  the downstream genes of the MVA pathway and deleting the genes of ackA and adhE.
  Enzymes involved in this pathway—MvaE: acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase/HMG-CoA reductase;
  MvaS: HMG-CoA synthase; MVK: mevalonate kinase; PMK: phosphomevalonate kinase; MVD:
  mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase; IDI: IPP isomerase; IspS: isoprene synthase;
  aceEF: pyruvate dehydrogenase; lpd: lipoamide dehydrogenase; adhE: alcohol/aldehyde
  dehydrogenase; pta: phosphate acetyltransferase; ackA: acetate kinase. Pathway intermediates—A-CoA:
  acetyl-CoA; AA-CoA: acetoacetyl-CoA; HMG-CoA: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA; Mev-P:
  mevalonate 5-phosphate; Mev-PP: mevalonate 5-diphosphate; IPP: isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  DMAPP: dimethylallyl diphosphate; PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; Acetyl-p: acetyl phosphate;
  NADH: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  ATP: adenosine triphosphate: ADP: adenosine diphosphate; pTrc: Trc promoter; pT7:
  T7 promoter.'
