caption: Regulatory network of important genes involved in EBV-dependent NPC. The
  genes circled in yellow represent the meta-A genes involved in different life cycles
  of EBV. Those circled in blue represent the meta-B genes found in EBV+-tumors. Those
  circled in green are three genes in common between meta-A genes and meta-B genes.
  The area shadowed in gray on the lower left shows the BZLF1 pathway in latent and
  lytic replication. The dotted rectangle shows the common DEK/E2F pathway. The genes,
  framed in rectangle, were up-regulated during latency while down-regulated in lytic
  proliferation. And the green dashed lines represent the circuit of the transcriptional
  association of SP1, IMPDH2, CD9 and EGR1.
