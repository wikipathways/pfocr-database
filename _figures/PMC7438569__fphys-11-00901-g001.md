caption: Overview of NAD+ metabolism in the heart. NAD+ is synthesized through the
  de novo pathway and the salvage pathway in mammalian cells. The de novo pathway
  generates NAD+ from Trp or NA. The salvage pathway, indicated by the thicker arrows,
  is the major NAD+ biosynthesis pathway in the heart where NAM generated from NAD+-consuming
  enzymes is converted into NMN through NAMPT – the rate limiting enzyme. NMN can
  also be generated from NR by NRK1/2. NMN is further converted into NAD+ by NMNAT1-3.
  A redox potential between NAD+ and its reduced form NADH is established by key catabolic
  processes including glycolysis, fatty acid β-oxidation and TCA cycle, which drives
  the electron transport chain (ETC). On the other hand, NAD+ is consumed by NAD+-consuming
  enzymes, including CD38 that generates cADPR, which is a Ca2+-mobilizing second
  messenger, PARP that catalyzes protein PARylation and SIRT that catalyzes protein
  deacetylation. These enzymatic reactions produce NAM as a byproduct that can be
  recycled back into NAD+ salvage pathway. In addition, NAD+ can also be consumed
  by NAD+ kinase which generates NADP+. Through CD38, NADP+ is further converted into
  NAADP, which is another Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger.
