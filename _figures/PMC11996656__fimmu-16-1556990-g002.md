caption: Mechanism of pyroptosis in OA pathogenesis. The progression of OA is closely
  associated with NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. Activation of the TLR/NF-κB
  signaling pathway promotes the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and activates
  Caspase-1, which cleaves GSDMD to generate the pore-forming GSDMD-NT, releasing
  inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-18, and HMGB1. The accumulation of inflammatory
  mediators in the joint cavity—including IL-1β, IL-18, and HMGB1—promote FLS pyroptosis,
  macrophage pyroptosis, chondrocyte pyroptosis and osteoclast formation. Consequently,
  in a persistent chronic inflammatory environment, it can cause synovial inflammation,
  osteophyte formation, cartilage degradation, leading to OA. (Created with BioGDP.com)
