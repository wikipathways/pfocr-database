caption: The thyrotropin receptor (TSH-R) is the main autoantigen in Graves’ hyperthyroidism
  and associated eye disease. TSH-R peptides are ingested by antigen-presenting cells
  (APC) through phagocytosis and expressed through MHC class II. T-helper cells recognize
  the antigen, by binding with the T-cell receptor, along with CD154 to its ligand
  CD40 on the surface of the APC. The activated T-helper cells bind to B-cells, transforming
  them into TSH-R antibody-secreting plasma cells through inflammatory cytokines interleukin
  II and gamma interferon. The synthesized TSAb bind to the TSH-R expressed by thyrocytes
  and orbital target cells (fibroblasts, pre-adipocytes), activating the Gαs adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) pathway. This stimulates protein kinase A which induces gene activation
  through the cAMP responsive element binding (CREB) protein. Additionally, the Gαq
  protein kinase C (PKC) pathway activates protein kinase B (Akt) inducing the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) further inducing gene expression. The induction of gene
  expression lead to differentiation into pre-adipocytes and synthesis of hydrophilic
  mucopolysaccharides (glycosaminoglycans), hence leading to edema and later fibrosis
  in the orbital space, resulting in the clinical phenotype of thyroid eye disease.
