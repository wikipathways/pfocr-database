caption: The two major RNA export receptor pathways, nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1)/nuclear
  transport factor 2-like export 1 (NXT1) and chromosome maintenance protein 1 (CRM1),
  are shown, and both are dysregulated in cancer. There are multiple routes to engage
  either of these pathways. For example, for the NXF1/NXT1 pathways, there are complexes
  that rely on ALY/REF (transcription export (TREX) and AREX) and also on GANP (TREX2).
  There are the intronless H2a RNAs with intronless transport elements (ITEs) that
  rely on SR proteins but additionally some intron-containing RNAs also require SR
  proteins. For the NXF1/NXT1 pathway, cargo release depends on DDX9/Gle1. There are
  also multiple routes to engage the CRM1 pathways. These are depicted for IFN1α,
  HuR, eIF4E, and NXF3. For the CRM1 pathway, cargo release involves RanGTP hydrolysis
  through either the RanBP1 or RanBP2 pathways (A). For the case of eIF4E overexpression
  (B), RanBP2 levels are reduced (depicted by fibrils in shadow) and RanBP1 levels
  are increased. Thus, the RanBP1 release pathways are thought to predominate. Once
  cargoes are released from both the NXF1/NXT1 and CRM1 pathways, exportins and associated
  factors are recycled (not shown). Only four cytoplasmic fibrils and four nuclear
  basket protrusions are displayed for simplicity of presentation (as there are eight
  fibrils per nuclear pore complex (NPC)). Factors known to be involved in cancer
  are encapsulated in red dashed lines. This is not an exhaustive list of all NPC
  factors that are dysregulated in cancer but highlights the fact that all facets
  of the NPC can be impacted (nuclear basket, central channel, and cytoplasmic fibrils).
