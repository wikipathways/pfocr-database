caption: Perception and transduction of cold signals in plants. When cold stress occurs,
  the COLD1 senses cold signals and then interacts with RGA1 to activate Ca2+ channels
  (ANNEXIN1 and CNGCs) to release Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. An increase in Ca2+ in
  the cytoplasm can further activate the regulatory pathways of three Ca2+-binding
  proteins (CaM/CML, CBLs and CDPK/CPK) to enhance the cold tolerance of plants. First,
  CaM/CML activates CRLK1 and CAMTA to regulate the MAPK-ICE1-CBF cascade pathway.
  Second, CBLs and CRT interact with CIPKs to increase the expression levels of DREB/CBF,
  respectively. Third, CPK phosphorylates NLP7 and promotes its ability to regulate
  the expression of CBFs. In addition, Ca2+ signaling triggered by COLD1 promotes
  the biosynthesis pathway of vitamins E and K (By increasing the expression of VTE4
  and VKORC1), leading to the production of PAP and its transport into the nucleus
  to regulate the miRNAs in chloroplasts. Moreover, cold-induced COG3 interaction
  with OsFtsH2 maintains the balance of photosystem II protein D1 in chloroplasts.
  Interestingly, the RG4 structure of mRNA in the nucleus and the COG1-OsSERL2 complex
  in the plasma membrane also function as cold receptors
