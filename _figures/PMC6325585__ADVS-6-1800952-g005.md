caption: 'Optotherapeutic strategies: several optogenetic implants have already been
  tested in mice and proved to be functional to treat diabetes as well as erectile
  dysfunction. a) An implant harboring synthetic mammalian designer cells equipped
  with blue light–induced melanopsin signals through the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling
  pathway. Activation of melanopsin results in influx of Ca2+ ions from outside of
  the cells and release of calcium from the ER. Ultimately, this leads to activation
  of the phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates NFAT and triggers expression
  of insulin from a synthetic NFAT‐responsive promoter. b) To tackle the delicate
  issue of erectile dysfunction, a blue light–inducible soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC) of bacterial origin was engineered to favor GTP over ATP as a substrate. 1)
  To evaluate the performance of the system more easily in cell culture, cAMP levels
  were read out by the cAMP‐responsive CRE pathway. 2) Activation of the enzyme also
  directly leads to increased cGMP levels, triggering relaxation of smooth muscle
  cells. To avoid side effects, this system was not used as a cell‐based therapy,
  but was integrated directly into smooth muscle cells in the endothelium of the corpora
  cavernosum of rats. c) Two other approaches capitalized on the soluble c‐di‐GMP
  synthase BphS, which can be directly activated by far‐red light. In one system,
  c‐di‐GMP activated a chimeric transcription factor based on the bacterial protein
  BldD that dimerizes and binds to the DNA in a c‐di‐GMP‐dependent manner and is fused
  to the transactivators VP64 and p65. To avoid overproduction of c‐di‐GMP and overactivation
  of the system, YhjH was coexpressed; it hydrolyzes c‐di‐GMP to form inactive pGpG.
  In another study, c‐di‐GMP was used as an inducer of the endogenous STING pathway,
  which activates the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through
  phosphorylation by TANK‐inding kinase 1 (TBK1). Activated IRF3 binds to IRF3‐binding
  sites on a synthetic promoter and triggers insulin expression.'
