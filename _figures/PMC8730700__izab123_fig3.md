caption: A biological pathway perspective for the 13 serum analytes that were strongly
  associated with CD in this study (P < 0.0015). These 13 analytes were found to be
  significantly elevated in the sera of CD patients and reflect the complex nature
  of the inflammatory processes that are ongoing in these patients. Many of these
  are chemoattractants, produced and secreted by a variety of cells such as epithelial
  cells (CCL11), neutrophils (CXCL8, CXCL9), monocytes/macrophages (CXCL1), and play
  an important role in the recruitment (dashed arrows) of neutrophils, eosinophils,
  and T cells. Many of the other analytes play important roles in regulation and crosstalk
  of immune cells/response (IL-7, soluble IL-2Rα, IFN-γ, IL-18) tissue regeneration
  (IL-6, HGF), angiogenesis (VEGF, HGF), and cellular differentiation (IL-5). Though
  most of these analytes are common to all CD subgroups (based on disease behavior
  and disease location), some seem to be more strongly associated with ileal (red)
  or colorectal location (green). Analytes are positioned next to the cells that are
  primarily responsible for their production and secretion. Dashed arrows represent
  chemoattractant properties of denoted cytokine/chemokine.
