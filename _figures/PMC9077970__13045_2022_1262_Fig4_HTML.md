caption: Autophagy crosstalks with tumor metabolism in AML pathogenesis. Distorted
  autophagy in the heterozygous loss of Atg5 protein in AML alters cell metabolism
  to aerobic glycolysis and enhances its aggressiveness. Decreased glycolysis and
  accumulation of lactate by syrosingopine (MCT4 inhibitor) inhibits cell proliferation
  through autophagic cell death. Glutamine depletion through L-asparaginase inhibits
  the mTOR pathway, strongly activating autophagy and apoptosis. AML with overexpressed
  FASN gene enhances mTOR signaling to sequester the transcription factor TFEB in
  the cytoplasm, thus blocking activities of leukemic cell differentiation. Lipid
  metabolism through autophagy is crucial to maintain the OXPHOS function in AML.
  When lipophagy is blocked, lipid droplets accumulate in AML cells, which suppress
  mitochondrial OXPHOS and cause cell death
