caption: Upon stimulation by GH binding, GHR activates Jak2. Activated Jak2 phosphorylates
  GHR on tyrosine residues which in turn recruit members of the STAT family of transcription
  factors. Additionally, Src kinase and Shc adaptor proteins are also recruited to
  the GHR to activate a series of signaling pathways. STATs homodimerize or heterodimerize
  and translocate to the nucleus to regulate an array of genes under physiological
  conditions. Coordinated action of STATs and other signaling pathways leads to a
  balanced state of physiological lipolysis to provide energy for growth, development
  and metabolism under normal and fasting/starvation conditions.However, chronic levels
  of elevated GH (as seen in patients with acromegaly) leads to activation of the
  Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway which dominates other signaling pathways. As a result, phopshorylated
  ERK translocates to nucleus and phosphorylates PPARγ. Phopshorylated PPARγ is targeted
  for degradation leading to downregulation of anti-lipolytic genes such as FSP27
  and G0S2. Sustained levels of systemic FFAs as a result of deregulated lipolysis
  cause lipotoxicity and pave the way for the development of insulin resistance, diabetes
  and related metabolic diseases.
