caption: EPO and EPO receptors. EPO has been demonstrated to interact with two classic
  receptors to initiate its pleiotrophic effects. A homodimeric receptor with two
  units of EPOR (yellow structures) is expressed on hematopoietic cells, while a heterodimeric
  receptor with one EPOR and one βcR (CD131) unit (yellow and cyan structure) is expressed
  on cells in non-hematopoietic tissues such as the brain, spleen, and lungs. EPO
  activates different intracellular pathways through EPORs, leading to anti-apoptotic
  gene expression and the inhibition of pro-apoptotic genes. These actions allow for
  cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Activation of the homodimeric
  EPOR/EPOR leads to erythropoiesis, while activation of the heterodimeric EPOR/βcR
  (CD131) leads to tissue repair and recovery (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). The JAK/STAT (Janus
  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is involved in
  many vital cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation,

  3-kinase/protein kinase B) is activated by numerous genes and improves cell proliferation
