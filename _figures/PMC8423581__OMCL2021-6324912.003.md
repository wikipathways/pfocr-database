caption: Effect of exosomes on osteoclasts. The stimulation of RANK by RANKL initiates
  a long series of downstream signaling and gene expression cascades. Exosomes with
  proinflammatory effects increase the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α
  and IL-1, which promote the expression of RANKL and enhance the sensitivity of osteoclasts
  to RANKL. IL-1 can also promote osteoclast maturation directly through MITF. Exosomes
  containing miR-214 or miR-106b promote osteoblast maturation by blocking the inhibitory
  effect of PTEN on the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. RANKL-containing exosomes bind
  directly to RANK on the surface of osteoclasts and activate the RANK signaling pathway.
  By contrast, miR-1260b-containing exosomes inhibit the activation of Jun-N terminal
  kinase (JNK) by Wnt5a to suppress RANKL signaling. Mature osteoblast-derived RANK-containing
  exosomes inhibit RANKL signaling by competitively binding to RANKL.

  description: Effect of exosomes on osteoclasts. The stimulation of RANK by RANKL
    initiates a long series of downstream signaling and gene expression cascades.
    Exosomes with proinflammatory effects increase the expression of inflammatory
    cytokines TNF-α and IL-1, which promote the expression of RANKL and enhance the
    sensitivity of osteoclasts to RANKL. IL-1 can also promote osteoclast maturation
    directly through MITF. Exosomes containing miR-214 or miR-106b promote osteoblast
    maturation by blocking the inhibitory effect of PTEN on the PI3K-Akt signaling
    pathway. RANKL-containing exosomes bind directly to RANK on the surface of osteoclasts
    and activate the RANK signaling pathway. By contrast, miR-1260b-containing exosomes
    inhibit the activation of Jun-N terminal kinase (JNK) by Wnt5a to suppress RANKL
    signaling. Mature osteoblast-derived RANK-containing exosomes inhibit RANKL signaling
    by competitively binding to RANKL.
