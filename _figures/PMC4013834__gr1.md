caption: Simplified schematic of major energy pathways in the brain include glycolysis,
  which takes places in the cytosol and produces pyruvate, which enters mitochondria
  and is converted into acetyl CoA that enters the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate
  can stay in the cytosol and is converted into lactate that is exported out of the
  cell. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) takes place in the cytosol and is an alternative
  energy pathway that can be up-regulated after injury; it is an important source
  of NADPH used to produce the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) for preventing oxidative
  stress.
