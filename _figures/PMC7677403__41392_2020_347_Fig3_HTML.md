caption: cGAS/STING- mediated signal transduction pathway. As the cytosolic DNA sensors,
  cGAS recognizes dsDNA from DNA viruses or dsDNA created by retroviruses. Following
  the detecting of DNA, cGAS synthesizes the second messenger cGAMP, which then binds
  to and activates STING on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In addition, STNG can
  sense CDNs. Activated STING translocates from ER to Golgi to form a complex with
  TBK1 or IKK. The activation of TBK1 or IKK induces the expression of type I IFN
  genes and other pro-inflammatory cytokines through the TBK1-IRF3/7 axis and NF-κB
