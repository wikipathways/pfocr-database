caption: The complement system can be activated through 3 pathways (top), all converging
  to the cleavage of C3 to generate C3a and C3b (middle). The classic pathway (CP)
  is typically activated by antibodies, but also, pentraxins (PTX), including C-reactive
  protein (CRP), serum amyloid P component (SAP), and PTX3 can activate C1q. The lectin
  pathway (LP) is activated through recognition of carbohydrates by mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL), ficolins, and collectins. Furthermore, LP activation may be mediated
  through IgM antibodies, e.g., directed against damaged self-antigens. The alternative
  pathway (AP) is activated by foreign or damaged own cells, facilitated by the continuous
  spontaneous hydrolysis of C3. AP also has an important function in the complement
  system, providing an amplification loop that enhances C3 activation independent
  of which pathway is initially activated. This effect is mainly a result of properdin
  (FP), the only positive regulator in the complement system, which stabilizes the
  C3 convertase. Activation of C3 leads to formation of a C5 convertase, cleaving
  C5 into C5a and C5b. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a bind to the receptors C3aR,
  C5aR1, and C5aR2, leading to downstream production of inflammatory mediators (bottom).
  C5b initiates the formation of the TCC, which forms the membrane attack complex
  (MAC) if inserted into a membrane (bottom). This may lead to lysis of bacteria and
  cells or in sublytic doses to activation of cells. The cleavage and inactivation
  of C3b generate iC3b, bind to complement receptors 3 (CR3; CD11b/CD18) and 4 (CR4;
  CD11c/CD18), facilitating phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and downstream inflammation
  (right). The complement system is tightly regulated by soluble inhibitors (yellow),
  including C1 inhibitor (C1-INH), factor H (FH), factor I (FI), C4-binding protein
  (C4BP), anaphylatoxin inhibitor (AI) inactivating the anafylatoxins (e.g., C5a to
  C5adesArg), vitronectin (Vn), and clusterin (Cl), keeping the continuous low-grade
  activation in the fluid phase in check. Host cell membranes are equipped with a
  number of inhibitors to protect them against attack by complement (right), including
  membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46), CR1 (CD35), decay accelerating factor (DAF;
  CD55), controlling C4 and C3 activation, and CD59 protecting against final assembly
  of the C5b-9 complex. Some attractive targets for therapeutic inhibition are indicated
  with black arrowheads, e.g., specific CP activation by one of the C1qrs components,
  specific LP activation by MBL and MASP intervention, and specific AP activation
  by neutralizing factor D (FD), which will attenuate the amplification of the system
  induced by all initial activation mechanisms. The inhibition of C3 is the broadest
  possible strategy, whereas inhibition of C5 cleavage will clock both the inflammatory
  potent C5a fragment and formation of the inflammatory and lytic C5b-9 complex. Alternatively,
  C5a can be inhibited, preserving the C5b-9 pathway, or the anaphylatoxin receptors
  can be blocked to prevent signaling. In particular, the blocking of C5aR1 will attenuate
  inflammation, whereas the effect of blocking C3aR and C5aR2 receptors is to be studied
  in more detail, as they might have more anti-inflammatory effects.
