caption: Rhizobial release and bacteroid differentiation within an infected plant
  cell of Medicago truncatula. Once the rhizobia are released in the infection droplets,
  they divide and elongate. They later on differentiate into bacteroids; many bacterial
  genes, such as those necessary for division, are then turned off, whereas genes
  the products of which are necessary for bacteroid metabolism (nitrogenase, transporters,
  etc…) are turned on. As all these events are important steps in the symbiosis, they
  are controlled tightly and many genes and their products are implicated in their
  control. All proteins within a black box are known to be involved with the NF perception.
  Those in a green box are known to be part of the common symbiotic transduction pathway.
  Proteins in a blue box are thought to play a role in both the epidermal and cortical
  nodulation programs. Proteins in a brown box are not known to play a role early
  in the nodulation process; they may be specific for controlling these specific steps.
  NFs are continuously produced by rhizobia within the infection thread and when the
  rhizobia are released, the NFs are perceived by NFP and LYK3, the Nod factor receptors.
  These receptors are likely to be recruited in a micro-domain by SYMREM1 expressed
  in the plasmalemma of the infected cell. SNAREs and NF-YA1 are essential in bacterial
  release, whereas NAC074, VAMP721, and RSD are required for bacterial elongation.
  The bacteria differentiate once they have perceived the antimicrobial NCRs, which
  are found in the bacteroid after they crossed both symbiosome and bacterial membranes.
  DNF1 is necessary for the entry of NCRs in the symbiosome. Bacterial differentiation
  is also under the control of DNF2. Finally, MtNAC920 working in concert with CP2
  trigger bacteroid senescence. The numbered stars represent potential location of
  ethylene signaling or action and the numbers correspond to the order in which these
  actions are reported in the text.
