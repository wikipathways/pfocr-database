caption: In the Drosophila developing imaginal tissues, 3 major classes of signaling
  molecules mediate Apoptosis induced Proliferation (AiP). Previous reports have depicted
  that Drosophila p53 (Dp53) and the JNK signaling pathways form a positive amplification
  loop with the apoptotic machinery to induce apoptosis and AiP. The blue solid lines
  and arrows delineate this pathway. In the study by Clavier et al published in this
  tissue, the authors identified that downstream of Rb, specific JNK pathway adaptors
  can be used in distinct combinations to generate distinct cellular outcome. The
  black solid arrows indicate the JNK pathway that leads to apoptosis, and the red
  solid arrows show the JNK pathway that mediates AiP.
