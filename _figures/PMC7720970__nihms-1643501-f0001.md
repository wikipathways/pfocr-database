caption: 'Tamoxifen, used as adjuvant therapy in patients with breast cancer, regulates
  estrogen receptor (ER) activity. In breast tissue, tamoxifen antagonizes ER, reducing
  cell proliferation and decreasing the recurrence of cancer. In contrast, tamoxifen
  phenocopies the protective effects of estrogens on vascular tissues, improving endothelial
  function, reducing atherosclerosis progression, and preventing neointima formation.
  However, an association among tamoxifen treatment and venous thromboembolism has
  also been identified. While tamoxifen fails to accelerate endothelial healing after
  perivascular electric injury of the carotid artery (top inset), an injury that triggers
  vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) apoptosis, it promotes endothelial cell (EC) recovery
  in the presence of functional SMCs after endovascular injury (bottom inset). Mechanistically,
  tamoxifen acts through nuclear ERα and promotes expression of Hedgehog pathway genes
  (Gli1, Gli2, Smo, Ptch1, Ptch2) in part through the tamoxifen-regulated transcription
  factor activation function 1 (AF1). Two mouse models were used to determine these
  cellular sub-functions of ERα signaling: 1) ERα-C451A mice that harbor a mutation
  in ERα that prevents ERα localization to the plasma membrane and showed responsiveness
  to tamoxifen in endothelial healing after endovascular injury, and 2) ERαAF10 mice,
  deficient in the tamoxifen-responsive AF1 transcription factor, that showed abrogation
  of tamoxifen-mediated reendothelialization after endovascular injury. (Created with
  BioRender.com). EC indicates endothelial cells; SMC indicates vascular smooth muscle
  cells; ER, indicates estrogen receptor.'
