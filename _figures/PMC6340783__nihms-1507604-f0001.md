caption: The HBV cycle includes virus attachment, entry, uncoating, trafficking to
  nucleus, cccDNA formation, transcription, translation, encapsulation, secretion,
  and integration. HBV infection is initiated via interaction with heparan sulfate
  proteoglycans (HSGP), resulting in a large envelope protein that binds NTCP. After
  internalization, viral capsids are released and then directed to the nucleus, where
  the HBV genomes are released. In the nucleus, relaxed circular DNA genomes are converted
  into cccDNAs, which can persist in the nucleus of infected cells as a mini-chromosome
  and serve as template for viral RNA transcription. Viral mRNAs are transported to
  the cytoplasm, where they are translated into viral proteins. Together with the
  viral polymerase, the pgRNA is encapsulated and reverse transcribed within the nucleocapsid
  into progeny rcDNA. Mature nucleocapsids are then either directed to the MVB pathway
  for envelopment with HBV envelope proteins or re-directed to the nucleus to establish
  a cccDNA pool. dslDNA that contains capsid is also produced that can be integrated
  into the cellular genome or released as defective virion. Drugs or antiviral agents
  designed to target different steps of the HBV life cycle are shown in red.
