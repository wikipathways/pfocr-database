caption: Putrescine (diamine), spermidine (triamine) and spermine (tetramine) are
  the major polyamines. Ornithine derived from the urea cycle provides the initial
  substrate for Odc mediated decarboxylation to putrescine. Amd1 provides the aminopropyl
  donor to support SRM and SMS mediated conversion to higher order polyamines, respectively.
  Pro-synthetic polyamine enzymes are shown in GREEN; catabolic enzymes are shown
  in RED (underlined enzymes are highly regulated with among shortest half-life of
  any mammalian enzyme. Polyamine therapeutics and their sites of action are in BLUE
  (described in the text). Those shown are in pre-clinical or early phase clinical
  development as cancer therapeutics. ODC1, ornithine decarboxylase; SRM, spermidine
  synthase; SMS, spermidine synthase; AMD1, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; AZIN1,
  Odc Antizyme inhibitor; SMOX, spermidine oxidase; PAOX, polyamine oxidase; SAT1,
  spermine/spermidine N-acetyltransferase; OAZ1,2,3, Odc Antizymes.
