caption: Model of DDX56 promotes IFN-β pathway activation to inhibit PRV infection.
  Cellular protein DDX56 promotes cGAS expression and interacts with cGAS. Further
  study shows DDX56 does not affect IRF3, but it promotes PRV-induced IRF3 phosphorylation.
  As expected, DDX56 expression promoted IRF3 translocation into the nucleus. Together,
  these findings demonstrate that DDX56 plays a positively regulation role in IFN-β
  production through interacting with cGAS and promoted the phosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation of IRF3.
