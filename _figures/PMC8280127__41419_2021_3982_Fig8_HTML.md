caption: 'The transcription of HOTAIRM1 is regulated by the binding of AML1 to its
  promoter region. As a trans factor, HOTAIRM1 inhibits the transcription of ARHGAP18
  in the nucleus in two ways: (1) It binds to the chromatin site downstream of ARHGAP18
  gene to inhibit the transcription of ARHGAP18. HOTAIRM1 may interact with other
  proteins to form a complex. (2) It binds to the AML1 protein to keep AML1 away from
  its target chromatin region, thereby preventing the gene transcription activity
  of AML1. After the transcription of ARHGAP18 is suppressed, its protein expression
  level is decreased, which increases the active form of RhoA-GTP and activates the
  RHOA/ROCK1 signaling pathway. Subsequently, the increase of the antiapoptotic gene
  BCL2 and the decrease of the proapoptotic gene BCL2L11 eventually lead to the decrease
  of apoptosis.'
