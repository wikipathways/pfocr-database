caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for the interaction between Jab1/COPS5 and PD-L1.
  In this case we showed the predicted expression level of other genes in the regulation
  network in response to increased measured level of PD-L1 based on the IPA database.
  The miRNAs in the figure are predicted ones that can target both Jab1/COPS5 and
  PD-L1, but no demonstration was reported yet. The color of each gene represents
  the corresponding expression level. Light-red means activation and light-blue means
  inhibition, while red means increased measurement and green means decreased measurement.
