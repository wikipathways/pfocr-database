caption: 'A model of muscle cell signaling in response to 1E3. Intact laminin structure
  is depicted. Inset: 1E3 LG4–5 region. 1E3 binds to the DGC via α-DG. Other components
  of the DGC are shown, along with associated signaling below. Left: Rac1/JNK/c-jun
  pathway previously characterized (, ), which shows stimulation by 1E3 at all concentrations.
  Right: PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway (, ), which shows a biphasic response to
  1E3. NF-κB has been closely associated with atrophy (, ) while Akt signaling is
  associated with resisting muscle atrophy (). The p21 small G-protein CDC42 has been
  shown to be important to myofiber diameter and increases upon atrophy () but was
  not included in the studies here.'

  growth, and the AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors but also has adverse effects.
