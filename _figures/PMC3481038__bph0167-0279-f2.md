caption: 'Scheme demonstrating mechanisms used by natural compounds to drive changes
  in the epigenome. (A) Reciprocal interconnections between all the components of
  the epigenome: DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs. Compounds
  driving changes in DNA methylation patterns may have indirect effects on other epigenetic
  components and vice versa. (B) PCNA is crucial for DNMT1 activity during replication
  when DNA methylation pattern is copied from a parental to a daughter DNA strand.
  p21 competes with DNMT1 for the same binding site on PCNA, which impairs DNMT1 activity.
  Compounds that lead to an increase in p21 expression can affect DNA methylation.
  Several natural agents such as curcumin and EGCG bind to the DNMT1 catalytic domain
  and impair its enzymatic activity. (C) AP-1 binding sites have been identified within
  the DNMT1 regulatory region. Compounds that inhibit the MAPK signalling pathway
  by, for example, up-regulating PTEN can attenuate DNMT1 transcription. (D) Compounds
  with a catechol group are excellent substrates for catechol-O-methyltransferase
  (COMT) that catalyzes their methylation. The COMT-mediated methylation reaction
  results in depletion of the methyl donor SAM and formation of SAH, which is a potent
  feedback inhibitor of DNA methylation.'
