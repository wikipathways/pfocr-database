caption: The proinflammatory intra and extracellular signalling in MEC disease. The
  orange background symbolizes the MEC, red represents the cytoplasm of residing cells
  and brown their nucleus. The level of evidence linking the depicted part of the
  pathway to MEC parthenogenesis are color-coded (red, yellow and green), proinflammatory
  deregulation is shown in blue. Fractions which were not investigated so far but
  bound to be a vital part of the proinflammatory signalling in MEC are shown in white.
  The pharmaceutical treatment options accessible within the inclusion criteria chosen
  in this review are shown as blue/red pills
