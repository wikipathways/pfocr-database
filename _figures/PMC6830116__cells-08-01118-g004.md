caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition. Crosstalk
  between multiple signaling pathways increase the expression of EMT transcription
  factors including SNAI1, SLUG, TWIST, and ZEB leads to loss of epithelial characteristics
  and gain of mesenchymal characteristics. Wnt/β-catenin pathway induces EMT by interacting
  with TCF/LEF. Growth factors including Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), FGF and hepatocyte
  growth factor (HGF) bind to their respective receptors to activate RAS/ERK signaling,
  RAS/PI3K signaling, and RAS/RAC signaling. Activation of RAS/RAC pathway subsequently
  leads to reorganization of cytoskeleton by elevating the expression of RAC and Cdc42.
  Hippo pathway inhibits YAP/TAZ pathway and EMT, but it will be suppressed when PI3K
  and F-actin are upregulated by other signaling pathways during EMT. Hedgehog (HH)/GLI
  and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways
  increase SNAI1 expression and drive the EMT program. TGF-β pathway promotes EMT
  via either Smad or non-Smad signaling. TGF-β/Smad signaling activates Smad2/3 complex
  where the complex can interact with transcription factors in the nucleus to drive
  EMT, activates p38 MAPK pathway and increases the expression of HMGA2 to upregulate
  N-cadherin. Non-Smad signaling activates PI3K/AKT signaling to induce EMT by suppressing
  GSK3 and promoting the expression of NF-κB. NCID cleaved by activated Notch pathway
  will translocate into the nucleus to increase SLUG expression. N-cadherin upregulates
  the expression of RhoA to strengthen the cell–cell junction and enforce cytoskeleton
  rearrangement. Abbreviations: IL = Interleukin; LATS = Large Tumor Suppressor; NCID
