caption: Proposed scenario of current strategies targeting different traits of dysfunctional
  mitochondria in Alzheimer disease (AD), including mitochondrial bioenergetics and
  mitochondrial homeostasis. In the right part, therapeutic candidates that target
  glucose metabolism and/or the electron transport chain (ETC) are reported in red.
  J147 targets α- F1 subunit of ATP synthase (ATP5A) modulating its activity. Insulin
  rescues insulin resistance occurring in AD and improves glucose utilization. Thiamet
  G is a potent and specific inhibitor of OGA, an enzyme that controls GlcNAc cycling.
  Reduced GlcNAc levels are associated with reduced glucose uptake and result in altered
  mitochondria function. Vitamin C, MitoQ and a lipoic acid are antioxidant therapeutic
  candidates, used as beneficial supplements for AD patients. DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol)
  is a pharmacological uncoupler targeting UCPs present in the mitochondrial inner
  membrane. In the left part of the figure, therapeutic candidates targeting mitochondrial
  homeostasis that involves mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, are shown in red.
  Resveratrol activates mitochondrial biogenesis by induction of SIRT1 or inhibition
  of cAMP phosphodiesterases. Metformin (Met) reduces ETC complex I activity, ultimately
  resulting in reduced ATP synthesis. Rapamycin is a potent and selective mTOR inhibitor
  able to regulate mitophagy. Latrepiridine and nicotinamide are both regulators of
  the autophagy pathway.
