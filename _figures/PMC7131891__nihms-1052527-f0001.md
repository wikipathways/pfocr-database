caption: 'a) Tetrameric GAPDH performs its canonical function catalyzing oxidative
  phosphorylation of glcyeraldyhyde-3-phosphate in the cytosol. The monomeric form

  human GAPDH: 4WNC.b) Holo-aconitase (Aco) in iron-rich (normal) conditions is bound
  to a [4Fe-4S] cluster and interconverts citrate and isocitrate as part of the citric
  acid cycle. In iron-deficient conditions, holo-aconitase loses the [4Fe-4S] cluster
  and undergoes structural changes, losing its enzymatic ability. The resultant apo
  form binds mRNA transcripts housing iron-response elements (IREs). Depending on
  the position of the IRE relative to the coding region (3´ or 5´), the apo-aconitase
  binding can either block degradation or ribosomal binding, respectively. TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid. Grey dots and cube respectively illustrate free ions and the bound [4Fe-4S]
  cluster.c) Glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) canonically charges tRNAGly with glycine,
  a process essential for protein synthesis. GlyRS also participates in controlling
  global neddylation levels by interacting with various components within the neddylation-dependent
  cell signaling pathway for proliferation and survival. GlyRS directly interacts
  with NEDD8, a ubiquitin-like protein, and activated (neddylated) Ubc12 (an E2 enzyme
  in the neddylation pathway). This process ultimately leads to activation of cullin
  proteins through neddylation, allowing the cell to progress through the cell cycle.
  PDB ID: human GlyRS 2ZT5.d) RNR-α forms a heterotetramer with RNR-β or RNR-p53β.
  The resulting complex constitutes the minimally-required quaternary state for reductase
  activity that catalyzes the reduction of NDPs (N=A,U,G,C) to dNDPs. RNR catalysis
  is the only means available for de novo dNTP synthesis required for DNA replication
  and repair. Binding of the di- and/or triphosphates of the indicated compounds to
  RNR-α results in formation of hexameric states, ultimately leading to anti-proliferation
  effects. PDB IDs: Human RNR-α dimer: 3HND, human RNR-α hexamer: 6AUI. Ribbon structure
  of heterotetramer is a model for an enzymatically active RNR-complex derived from
  E. coli RNR-subunits: 4R1R, 3R1R, 1RIB.'
