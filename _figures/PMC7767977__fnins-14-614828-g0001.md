caption: 'Illustration of the neuroprotective pathways following GHS-R1α activation
  by AG or ghrelin agonists in neurons and astrocytes. [1] Mitochondrial function:
  By activating the key mediator AMPK, AG induces the transcriptional co-activator
  PGC1α. The latter, in concert with NRF1/2, enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, the
  synthesis of TFAM and TFAM-mediated mtDNA replication/transcription. By increasing
  the transcription of Mfn2, PGC1α protects from MPTP/rotenone-driven mitochondrial
  fragmentation. In addition, AMPK/GAPDH-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear SIRT1
  frees the latter deacetylase and leads to the inactivation of pro-inflammatory NF-κB,
  the activation of the Bax-sequestrating Ku70 and the stimulation of FoxO1-regulated
  anti-oxidant and autophagy genes. Lastly, the induction of the AMPK/CPT1a/UCP2 pathway
  prevents pathological mitochondrial depolarization (such as by Aβ). Furthermore,
  UCP2-driven mitochondrial uncoupling increases the mitochondrial respiration, bioenergetic
  efficiency and mitigates the co-generation of ROS by the ETC, which may protect
  from the stress-induced hyperproduction of ATP and ROS during early stages of AD.
  Given that more advanced stages of AD are characterized by neuronal glucose hypometabolism
  and a chronic shift toward other bioenergetic processes, in particular the β-oxidation
  of lipids, AG may support the compensatory execution of β-oxidation to generate
  ATP. Notably, AMPK inhibits ACC, thus depleting the intracellular malonyl-CoA pools
  and, in turn, elevating the activity levels of the malonyl-CoA-regulated CPT1a (not
  shown). [2] Autophagy: (Macro)autophagy is primarily driven by the GHS-R1α/AMPK/TSC1/2-mediated
  inactivation of mTOR/mTORC1 and the direct phosphorylation of ULK1 via AMPK, resulting
  in the degradation of cellular waste, amyloids (Aβ/Tau/α-synuclein) and defective
  mitochondria. Moreover, by raising the intracellular NAD+ levels, AMPK reinforces
  its activity through the activation of the cytoplasmic, NAD+-dependent SIRT1 and
  the AMPK-kinase LKB1. SIRT1 is also involved in the deacetylation of Tau at Lys174,
  which was reported to abrogate the pathological propagation of Tau throughout the
  brain. Besides triggering autophagy, AG upregulates various ATGs and Beclin-1, while
  promoting autophagosome maturation and the autophagic flux. [3] Astrocytes: The
  stimulation of GHS-R1α encourages the expression of the lactate-efflux transporter
  MCT4 by astrocytes, leading to the increased secretion of lactate, a potent energy
  source for neurons.'
