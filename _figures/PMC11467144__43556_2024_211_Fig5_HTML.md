caption: 'EGF signalling pathways in the intestinal crypt and potential therapeutic
  targets. EGF: EGF stimulates the EGF receptor (ERBB), initiating the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. This cascade leads to the phosphorylation of various
  nuclear targets by ERK, which promotes cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis.
  Simultaneously, EGF signaling enhances the interaction between phosphocarnosine
  3-kinase (PI3K) and converts PIP2 to PIP3. Furthermore, the activated EGF receptor
  complex recruits Janus kinases (JAKs). The potential targets and their mechanisms
  of action have been marked with pink boxes'
