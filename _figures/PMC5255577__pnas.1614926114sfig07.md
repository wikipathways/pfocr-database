caption: A proposed model for the role of GAS6 in maintaining oral mucosal homeostasis.
  Under homeostatic conditions, 3–4 wk after birth, oral microbiota induces expression
  of GAS6 in the oral epithelium in a MYD88-dependent pathway, most likely via triggering
  TLR2/4 known to be expressed on oral epithelial cells. Expression of GAS6 inhibits
  activation of epithelial cells by microbiota by down-regulating secretion of proinflammatory
  cytokines and production of free radicals. In addition, GAS6 induces the differentiation
  of Treg rather than Th17 cells by controlling IL-6 expression in DCs. These conditions
  favor the colonization of the Firmicutes phylum, particularly Streptococcaceae,
  hallmarks of microbial homeostasis in the oral mucosa. In the absence of GAS6, the
  oral epithelium becomes activated and DCs induce Th17 cells, while reducing Treg
  numbers and function. As a result, the oral mucosa becomes inflamed, resulting in
  up-regulation of the enzymes, iNOS, NOX1, and DUOX2 in epithelial cells and neutrophils,
  which generate reactive nitrogen species (NO) and reactive oxygen species (O2−).
  Respiratory electron acceptors (NO3−) generated as a byproduct of the host inflammatory
  response support growth of the Proteobacteria phylum and Lactobacillales (Firmicutes)
  that express nitrate reductase and by anaerobic respiration convert NO3− to NO2−.
  Other bacterial populations, Firmicutes (Chlostridia) and Bacteroidetes are also
  preferentially expanded under inflammatory conditions, whereas the latter phylum
  contains several important oral pathogens that exist in periodontal inflammation
  disease.
papertitle: GAS6 is a key homeostatic immunological regulator of host–commensal interactions
