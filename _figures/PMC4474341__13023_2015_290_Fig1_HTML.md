caption: Biochemical pathways. The SCEH enzyme encoded by the ECHS1 gene is involved
  in different metabolic pathways. On the left side the pathways of valine, isoleucine
  and leucine are depicted. On the right side the pathway of medium/short-chain fatty
  acid oxidation is depicted. BCAT, branched-chain aminotransferase; BCKD complex,
  branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex; HIBCH, 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA
  hydrolase; HIBADH, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase; HMG-CoA lyase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  lyase; MHBD, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; MGH, 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA
  hydratase; IBD, isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  MCAD, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; MCC, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase;
  MMSDH, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; SBCAD, short branched-chain acyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; SCAD, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; SCEH, short-chain enoyl-CoA
  hydratase; SCHAD, short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
