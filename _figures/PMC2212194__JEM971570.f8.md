caption: Schematic diagram summarizing different aspects of neutrophil diapedesis
  in response to FMLP. In A, neutrophil n1 extends a cytoplasmic process that forms
  contact with a thinned portion of EC e1 as in Fig. , A and B; in B–D n1 has progressed
  through e1, the underlying basal lamina (bl) and a pericyte (p1). This pattern of
  near-simultaneous trans-migration through endothelium as well as other components
  of the vascular wall is illustrated in Fig.  C, but was less common than that exhibited
  by neutrophils n2 and n3 that, after crossing the EC barrier, paused for a time
  before progressing farther. In A, n2 initially makes contact with the endothelial
  surface with two processes, as in Fig.  B; one of these becomes dominant and leads
  the way as the neutrophil begins to traverse EC e2 in B, again as in Fig.  B. Having
  crossed the endothelial cell barrier, n2 does not immediately progress through the
  basal lamina; instead it remains covered over for a time (C and D) by a thin overlying
  rim of flattened EC cytoplasm (as in Fig. , arrowheads) and Fig.  D) before extending
  a pseudopod through the basal lamina and underlying pericyte in D. As it progresses
  through e2 (C and D), it is embraced by cytoplasmic processes that extend from abluminal
  portions of both e2 and an adjacent EC, e1 (as in Fig. ). Transmigration of n3 is
  similar to that of n1 and n2, except that n3 persists for a longer time in the subendothelial
  space superficial to the basal lamina. n3 in A corresponds to the neutrophil marked
  by a long arrow in Fig. ; n3 in C and D models neutrophils illustrated in Fig. ,
  arrowheads and Fig.  A and D. Extravasation of all three neutrophils is transendothelial
  and inter-EC junctions remain closed.
