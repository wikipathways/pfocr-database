caption: PPARβ up-regulates Akt- and E2fs, which control glycolysis, fatty acid homeostasis
  as well as cell proliferation in regenerating livers. In terms of metabolism, E2fs
  gene regulation facilitates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and the breakdown
  of glucose through glycolysis. E2fs regulate lipid homeostasis through modulating
  PPARγ expression. Akt activates the key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis.
  Moreover, Acly enhances cholesterogenesis and lipogenesis that may lead to fat accumulation
  in regenerating liver where it is used to stimulate cell proliferation. The produced
  fatty acid activates PPARγ, which might regulate E2fs through a feedback loop. Consequently,
  these metabolic activities generate energy and intermediates for cell proliferation.
  In addition to their roles in cell metabolism, Akt also regulates cell cycle through
  Cyclin D/Cdk4 complex while E2fs modulate cell cycle regulation, DNA replication
  and repair, as well as checkpoint control.
