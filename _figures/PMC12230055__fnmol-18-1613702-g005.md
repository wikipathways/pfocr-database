caption: Visualized network mapping of relevant journals and co-cited journals in
  PI3K/Akt signaling pathway research in ischemic stroke; (a) network of journals
  that have published at least five papers generated using VOSviewer. Different nodes
  in the graph represent different journals, and the node size is proportional to
  the number of papers published in the journal; (b) network of co-cited journals
  with at least 40 citations generated using VOSviewer. Different nodes in the graph
  represent different co-cited journals, and the node size is proportional to the
  number of citations; (c) dual-map overlay of journals illustrating citation relationships
  between citing journals (knowledge frontier areas in red boxes) and cited journals
  (knowledge base areas in blue boxes). These citation links provide a visual representation
  of the interactions and connections between the topics of the two types of journals
