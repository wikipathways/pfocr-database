caption: Working model showing the physiological relevance and the potential plant-defence
  implications of the vacuole-to-nucleus strictosidine activation. (a) The subcellular
  compartmentation of STR and SGD is displayed illustrating that an unknown transportation
  system of strictosidine across the tonoplast (labelled with "?") constitutes a potential
  important rate limiting step for the flux of MIA biosynthetic pathway. In C. roseus,
  this part of the pathway is specifically localised to the epidermis of aerial organs.
  According to the drastic consequences of the CrSGD-mediated massive strictosidine
  activation (demonstrated by the in vitro experience), this potential rate limiting
  step appears as a mean for the cells to control the rate of formation of toxic dialdehyde
  following the deglucosylation of strictosidine by SGD in the nucleus in relation
  with the metabolic capacity of the next MIA biosynthetic enzymes. (b) In the case
  of herbivore feeding or necrotrophic pathogen attack, this subcellular compartmentation
  may be mechanically or enzymatically disrupted. As a consequence, the massive deglucosylation
  of the strictosidine pool by highly stable SGD aggregates leads to the overproduction
  of the dialdehyde form to such a level that the MIA biosynthetic machinery is not
  fully able to take in charge. Massive protein cross-linking and precipitation could
  therefore be a potential mean for the plant to deter the herbivores and/or the necrotrophic
  microorganism from their feeding habit.
