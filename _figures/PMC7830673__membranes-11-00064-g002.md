caption: 'Antiviral strategies aimed at blocking EBOV and SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle.
  (A) Different antivirals tackle viral and host factors involved in EBOV replicative
  cycle. (B) Antivirals directed against the SARS-CoV-2 endocytic pathway. Several
  of these antivirals have also been proposed to block EBOV entry through similar
  mechanisms. (C) Antiviral strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 cycle in cells undergoing
  viral fusion at the plasma membrane. nAbs: neutralizing antibodies. Immunological
  antiviral functions of neutralizing antibodies (NK- or complement-mediated infected
  cell lysis and macrophage phagocytosis) are highlighted in boxes.'
