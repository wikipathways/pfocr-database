caption: Crosstalk between Wnt, Shh, primary cilia and other related signaling components
  in orofacial clefts. Shh signaling, which is regulated by primary cilia or intraflagellar
  transport proteins, represses canonical Wnt signaling through the negative Wnt regulator
  Sfrp, while β-catenin may regulate Shh signaling, suggesting a negative-feedback
  loop between the Wnt and Shh pathways in lip/palate formation. The non-canonical
  Wnt signaling molecule Prickle1 also activates Shh signaling, which may subsequently
  inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway. There is a complex interplay between the Fox,
  Fgf, Shh and Tgfβ family members during lip/palate development. The phenotypic outcomes
  of the key signaling components highlighted in this figure were demonstrated in
  the respective mutant mouse models.
