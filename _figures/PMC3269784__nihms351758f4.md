caption: (A) SOX and TCF may compete for a limited pool of β-catenin. This may occur
  on DNA or independent of DNA-binding. (B) SOX and TCF may compete for DNA-binding
  to the same sites in target gene promoters. (C) SOX might stabilize TCF/Tle repressor
  complexes, and/or exclude β-catenin and co-activators. This could occur though SOX
  DNA binding or by a direct interaction between SOX and TCF (not shown). SOX might
  recruit (D) transcriptional co-repressors, or (E) co-activators to Wnt-target gene
  promoters, either though DNA-binding or by an association with β-catenin/TCF. (F)
  SOX proteins might recruit post-translational modifying enzymes to β-catenin and/or
  TCF. The resulting phosphorylations (P), ubiquitination (Ub) or SUMOylation (S)
  could impact protein stability, activity and/or subcellular localization. (G) Some
  SOX proteins promote the degradation of β-catenin (and TCF). In the case of SOX9
  this appears to involve nuclear import of the GSK3-containing destruction complex.
  Other studies suggest and alternative degradation pathway. (H) Sox and Wnt-signaling
  can functionally interact in negative feedback loops, (upper) or in mutually repressive
  associations.
