caption: TNF receptor (TNFR) pathway of signaling. Two complex model is shown. Upon
  ligation with TNF-α (with in 10–20 min), TNFR I undergo trimerization and recruits
  various adapter molecules resulting in the activation of NF-κB, which induces several
  anti-apoptotic genes (Complex I formation) and survival signal. This is followed
  by (more than 2–3 hours) by an endocytosis of receptor complex resulting in the
  dissociation of certain adapter proteins (TRAF-2, RIP) and recruitment of fas –
  associated death domain (FADD) and procasepase-8 to form death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC). In the DISC, caspase-8 is activated and released into the cytoplasm
  where it activates effector caspases to induce apoptosis.
