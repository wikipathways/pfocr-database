caption: a To analyze the interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment,
  gastrointestinal tumor organoids were co-cultivated with cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs). b To analyze the interaction between immune cells and malignant cells, to
  study the interaction and to allow the testing of immunotherapeutic approaches,
  gastrointestinal tumor organoids were co-cultivated with immune cells. c Wild-type
  organoids can be engineered into tumor organoids using CRISPR/Cas9 by generating
  tumorigenic mutations to study tissue-specific oncogenic pathway alterations, to
  monitor cancer initiation and progression and to functionally analyze (candidate)
  oncogenes.
