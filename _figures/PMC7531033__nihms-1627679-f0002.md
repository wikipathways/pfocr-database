caption: 'Aspirin: mechanism of action against cyclooxygenase pathway. Aspirin exerts
  its anti-inflammatory effects mainly by inhibiting COX, a key enzyme responsible
  for PG biosynthesis from AA. Two major isoforms of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, catalyze
  the conversion of AA to prostanoids which are metabolized by tissue-specific synthases
  to different prostanoids. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most tissues and
  is highly expressed in platelets, where it is involved with platelet activation
  via the generation of TXA2, and gastric epithelial cells where it protects gastric
  mucosa via the generation of PGE2. COX-2 is expressed in several tissues and is
  induced in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to PGE2 production.
  Aspirin irreversibly inactivates both COX-1 and COX-2 and has several different
  pharmacological effects ranging from anti-platelet action at low doses to anti-inflammatory
  action at high doses is dependent on drug availability in the target tissue and
  recovery of COX activity through de novo enzyme synthesis. Abbreviations: AA, arachidonic
  acid; PG, prostaglandin; COX, cyclooxygenase; TXA2, thromboxane A2; and GI, gastrointestinal.'
