caption: Neuroinflammation activates bystander microglia and astrocytes to secrete
  IL-1β. Astrocytes respond to IL-1β by secreting TIMP-1. In this study we use a panel
  of small molecule pathway-selective inhibitors to delineate the signal transduction
  mechanism facilitating IL-1β-induced astrocyte TIMP-1 expression. p38K- and ERK1/2-selective
  inhibitors reduced and completely blocked IL-1β-induced astrocyte TIMP-1 mRNA and
  protein expression, respectively. U0126, the ERK1/2-selective inhibitor, also blocked
  TIMP-1 promoter activity.
