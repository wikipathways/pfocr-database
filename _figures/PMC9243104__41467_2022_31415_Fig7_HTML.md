caption: Shown are the sequential steps in the HR pathway involved in DNA repair or
  replication reactions, and the effect of WASp deficiency on RPA-coupled mis-regulation
  of these critical steps/reactions, which ultimately lead to genome instability,
  spontaneously or insult-induced.
papertitle: WASp modulates RPA function on single-stranded DNA in response to replication
  stress and DNA damage.
