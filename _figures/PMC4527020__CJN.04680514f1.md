caption: Location and signaling pathways of pattern recognition receptors. Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound glycoproteins and consist of a functional homomer
  (e.g., TLR4) or heteromer (e.g., Toll/IL-1 receptor [TLR] 1:TLR2). TLRs have characteristic
  ligand-binding motifs (leucine-rich repeats and cysteine-rich repeats) and cytoplasmic
  signaling domains (TIR homology domains). Note the differential localization of
  TLRs. Upon activation of TLRs, the TIR domain engages the adaptor molecule MyD88,
  with the exception of TLR3, which exclusively signals through TRIF. The TIR domain
  of TLR4 can engage both MyD88 and TRIF pathways. The coreceptor CD14 facilitates
  internalization of TLR4 and subsequently activates TRIF signaling pathway. The best-characterized
  cytosolic receptor is the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. The mature inflammasome activates
  caspase-1, which in turn generates IL-1β and IL-18. These cytokines induce various
  proinflammatory pathways, including programmed inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis).
