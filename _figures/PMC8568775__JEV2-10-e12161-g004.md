caption: Schematic picture summarizing the immunomodulatory effects elicited by microbiota‐derived
  BEVs in the gut. The drawing shows the intestinal epithelium covered with the mucin
  layer that prevents access of luminal microbes while allowing passage of BEVs. Immune
  cells (lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells) in the lamina propria are shown
  below the epithelial monolayer. Microbiota derived BEVs exert immune modulation
  by two main mechanisms. (i) Undirect activation of immune cells through the intestinal
  epithelium (left scheme). Internalized EVs by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
  activate the cytosolic receptor NOD1 that triggers secretion of immune effectors,
  which in turn stimulate gut‐associated lymphoid cells to produce a wide range of
  cytokines. Activation of the NOD1 signalling pathway by microbiota BEVs is shown
  encircled in more detail. BEVs are internalized through clathrin‐mediated endocytosis
  and recruit NOD1 (grey cylinders) to early endosomes. Activated NOD1 interacts with
  the specific kinase RIP2 (red circles), which leads to NF‐kB activation and the
  subsequent upregulation of host genes involved in the inflammatory response (IL‐6,
  IL‐8). (ii) Direct activation of gut resident immune cells by microbiota BEVs that
  leads to secretion of immune mediators and secretory IgA (middle scheme). In addition
  to direct interaction with microbiota BEVs that reach the gut‐associated lymphoid
  tissue via transcytosis across M cells, dendritic cells (DCs) also interact with
  luminal BEVs by extending pseudopodia across the epithelial cell layer (right scheme).
  Studies with several gut microbiota species revealed that BEVs activate DCs in a
  strain‐specific manner. Differential regulation of miRNAs in DCs is one of the regulatory
  mechanisms involved in the specific immunomodulatory effects of BEVs isolated from
  probiotic and commensal E. coli is (highlighted in the adjacent violet circle).
  In conclusion, DCs integrate incoming signals delivered by microbiota BEVs and set
  up specific programs that promote differentiation of naïve T cells into effector
  T cells (Th1, Th2, Th17, Th22) or regulatory T cells (Treg), thus allowing coordination
  of suitable T cell responses
