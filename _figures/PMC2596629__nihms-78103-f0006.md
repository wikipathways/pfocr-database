caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating two opposing signaling pathways activated
  by DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion in NB cells. ODC, AdoMetDC, and polyamines
  control cell survival and cell cycle arrest in human NB cells by regulating Akt/PKB
  and p27Kip1 phosphorylations. Despite cell cycle arrest induced upon polyamine depletion,
  NB cells are able to survive by activating the anti-apoptotic protein Akt/PKB via
  the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Polyamine depletion by DFMO leads to p27Kip1 phosphorylations
  at Ser10 and Thr198 (black), but not Thr178 (white) as well as protein accumulation,
  thereby contributing to G1 cell cycle arrest. Concomitantly, DFMO treatment leads
  to activation of Akt/PKB by phosphorylation at Ser473 (black), but not Ser308 (white)
  as well as inactivation of GSK-3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 (black). Abbreviations:
  AI, Akt/PKB inhibitor IV; AdoMetDC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; ODC, ornithine
  decarboxylase; DFMO, ODC inhibitor α-difluoromethylornithine; LY, PI3K inhibitor
  LY294002; SAM486A, AdoMetDC inhibitor CGP48664.'
