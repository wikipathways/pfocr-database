caption: High levels of Aβ (green helix) develop in the brain prior to the onset of
  Alzheimer’s pathology (top left). Longer forms of Aβ have more hydrophobic amino
  acid residues (gold) on remnant transmembrane domain, thereby increasing transient
  insertion (downward arrow) into the plasma membranes of nearby cells including endothelial
  cells (red). Elevated tissue levels of Aβ cause an accumulation of Aβ on the surface
  of the cell (several helices). Some peptide enters the endosome pathway (left).
  The amino termini of inserted Aβ peptides are identical to the Nicastrin-binding
  region of the APP intermediate C99 (not shown) and transiently bind to the γ-secretase
  complex (two sided arrow). Competition for Nicastrin binding and γ-secretase access
  reduces the processing of other substrates such as NEXT (shown). Interference with
  NEXT processing inhibits the production of NICD, which de-represses transcription
  factors such as Hes-1 and Hey-1. GSI has a similar effect. De-repression of NICD
  targets causes endothelial shaft cells to adopt tip cell morphology (upper right).
  Tip cells lead to formation of new blood vessels, and cycling of this process (looped
  arrow) over years and decades leads to hypervascularization (top right). This process
  may also occur with other extracellular cleavage (ex) products of γ-secretase (shown)
  creating feedback that tempers γ-secretase activity.
