caption: PG biosynthesis, receptors and signalling pathways. (A) Arachidonic acid
  is metabolized by COX, either COX‐1 or COX‐2, to PGH2, which is then converted to
  each PG, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2⍺, PGI2 or TXA2, by respective synthases. NSAIDs inhibit
  COXs and suppresses PG biosynthesis. Each PG acts on its cognate receptor to exert
  its actions. PGD2 acts on PGD receptors, DP1 and DP2 (formerly designated as CRTH2,
  chemoattractant receptor‐homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells); PGE2 acts
  on four subtypes of PGE receptors, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4; PGF2α acts on PGF receptor,
  FP; PGI2 acts on PGI receptor, IP; TXA2 acts on TXA receptor, TP. (B) All of the
  nine PG receptors are GPCRs and exert their actions by modulating second messengers
  and intracellular signal transduction. Dependent on their downstream signalling
  pathways and structural similarity, they are classified into three groups. The relaxant
  group consists of DP1, EP2, EP4 and IP that are mainly coupled to an elevation of
  intracellular cAMP levels and activate the cAMP‐PKA‐CREB pathway. The contractile
  group consists of EP1, FP and TP that are coupled to Ca2+signalling and PKC activation.
  Both EP3 and DP2 receptors are coupled to a reduction in the levels of intracellular
  cAMP and belong to the inhibitory PG receptor group. However, while EP3 receptors
  with other PG receptors constitute the family of PG receptors, DP2 belongs to the
  chemo‐attractant GPCR family. In addition to these main downstream signalling pathways,
  each PG receptor also activates other signal transduction pathways. For example,
  EP2 and EP4 receptors activate the PI3K pathway and form a complex with β‐arrestin
  to transactivate the EGF receptor; TP and EP3 receptors activate the small G‐protein
  Rho; IP activates the PKC and Ca2+signalling; and DP2 receptors activate the PI3K
  pathway. Furthermore, EP3 receptor has various alternatively spliced variants in
  its carboxyl terminus, which can couple to various signalling pathways other than
  the pathways mentioned (Sugimoto and Narumiya, ).
