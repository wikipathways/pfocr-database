caption: Graphic summary of the effects of autophagy on necrotic core formation mediated
  by mitochondria‐mediated macrophage apoptosis. As shown in the graphic summary,
  7‐KC impairs autophagy flux through mechanisms that might involve in lysosomal leakage
  or cholesterol crystal overloading. Meanwhile, 7‐KC leads to mitochondrial dysfunction,
  indicated by down‐regulated Δψm, excessive ROS generation and cytochrome c release,
  along with increased mitochondrial fragmentation. Increasing of ROS levels bring
  about activity of MAPK‐NF‐κB signalling pathway. Meanwhile, cytochrome c release
  activates caspase cascade pathway. All of these eventually cause macrophage apoptosis
  which promotes necrotic core formation in vulnerable plaques. Moreover, the activation
  of autophagy will lead to autophagosome and autolysosome formation, which inhibits
  mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, autophagy protects against mitochondria‐mediated
  macrophage apoptosis and inhibits necrotic core formation in vulnerable plaques
