caption: 'Schematic presentation of the postsynaptic structure and function on the
  basis of acetylcholine receptor clustering centered on agrin- and Wnt-signalings,
  trans-synaptic communication and synaptic stabilization. In the postsynaptic membrane,
  nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are aggregated in the non-innervated
  stage via Wnts-MuSK cysteine-rich domain (CRD)-dishevelled protein signaling pathway
  to form nAChR microclusters (AChR prepatterning: located in the central part of
  the muscle membrane where incoming axons are guided) (orange line with arrow; via
  activation by Rac1), and in the innervated stage via agrin-MuSK immunoglobulin-like
  domains 1 and 2 (Ig1/2) signaling pathway to form full-sized nAChR clusters (blue
  line with arrow; via activation by Rho). The nAChR clusters in non-innervated and
  innervated stages are anchored by rapsyn (immobilized by heat-shock proteins, HSPs,
  including tumorous imaginal disc 1 short form, Tid1s, which belongs to HSP40 family)
  at the postsynaptic membrane. The kinase activity and subsequent downstream signalings
  by the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of MuSK, located after the transmembrane
  segment, are crucial for the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction.
  The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (Lrp4) plays an essential
  role in agrin- and Wnts-signaling pathways as the receptor for both signals. In
  the molecular structure of Lrp4, the first propeller domain interacts with agrin;
  in the third β-propeller domain, its edge part mediates the MuSK signaling and its
  central cavity mediates the Wnt signaling. As the trans-synaptic communication,
  the signaling mediated by Wnts-MuSK CRD contributes to the retrograde signal from
  muscle to nerve (Wnt canonical pathway via dishevelled protein (Dvl) and β-catenin),
  leading to presynaptic differentiation to localize active zone proteins for efficient
  synaptic transmission (left upper part). Others participating in the trans-synaptic
  communication are reviewed in detail in the text; among them, the retrograde signal
  of Lrp4 originates from its eight low-density lipoprotein a (LDLa) repeats to induce
  clustering of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins [] (left upper part). In
  addition, as shown in the right part (a part of synaptic stabilization), Laminins
  conduct the retrograde signal to firm the active zone architecture for sufficient
  synaptic transmission. Intracellularly, Dok7 (downstream of kinase 7) and neuregulin
  1 (NGR1)-ErbB receptor (receptor tyrosine kinase of EGF, epidermal growth factor,
  receptor family) (mediator: Erbin) interaction activate intracellular MuSK tyrosine
  kinase domain for nAChR cluster formation (left part); also, they contribute to
  postsynaptic stability via respective downstream effectors. The mediator for Dok7
  signal is Sorbs1/2 (downstream effectors of CT10 regulators of kinase (Crk/Crk-L));
  the mediator for NGR1-ErbB receptor interaction is α-dystrobrevin (both are indicated
  by long black lines from left to right with arrows). As shown in the right part
  (yellow frames) of the figure, the stability of the neuromuscular junction including
  AChR clusters, MuSK and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the postsynaptic membrane
  is modulated by the extracellular matrix proteins (collagen Q (Col Q), perlecan,
  biglycan (glycosaminoglycan-binding form) and dystroglycans (DGs)), which participate
  in cytoskeletal dynamics. In addition, the postsynaptic structure is stabilized
  by the laminin-network including laminins, muscle agrin and DGs. The transmembrane
  dystroglycan (β-type) binds to rapsyn for anchoring AChR clusters at the postsynaptic
  membrane and also link utrophin to cytoskeleton for synaptic stability. Additionally,
  Col Q (C-terminus) and biglycan (non-glycanated form) bind both MuSK extracellular
  domains (Ig1 and CRD), leading to their implication in reinforcing a functional
  bridge between the agrin-signaling and the Wnt-signaling. Cortactin acts as a tyrosine
  kinase substrate and also a regulator of actin polymerization via actin-related
  proteins 2/3 complex (Arp2/3 complex); its tryrosine phosphorylation is enhanced
  by agrin/MuSK signaling (as indicated by blue line from central to right with arrow).
  Coronin 6 contributes to firm nAChR clustering via the modulation of actin dynamics.'
