caption: Effects of APS on ICIs, CAR-T therapy, and DC cancer vaccines within the
  TME. This involves the enhancement of ICIs through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. APS-induced
  activation of DCs improves the effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy with cytokine-induced
  killer (CIK) cells and APS components, particularly abundant in dextran, which act
  as potent adjuvants for DC-based cancer immunotherapy vaccines. The blue arrow belongs
  to the APS-stimulated adoptive cell immunotherapy arrow, the purple arrow belongs
  to the APS-stimulated immune checkpoint inhibitor arrow, and the pink arrow belongs
  to the APS-stimulated DC cancer vaccine arrow. The black up arrow indicates an increase
  in a certain factor during APS stimulation, and the black down arrow indicates a
  decrease in a certain factor during APS stimulation
