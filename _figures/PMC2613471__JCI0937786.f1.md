caption: The figure depicts the outcome of the interaction of different ligands with
  the Notch1 receptor, which triggers signaling via two distinct pathways. Canonical
  ligands of the DSL family activate genes such as HES1 and HES5 (HES1,5) that inhibit
  OPC differentiation but permit OPC proliferation, resulting in the maintenance and/or
  expansion of the OPC pool. In contrast, the noncanonical ligand F3/Contactin leads
  to OPC differentiation and subsequent myelination of axons by promoting expression
  of myelin genes such as myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). However, in this issue
  of the JCI, Nakahara et al. () present data supporting the conclusion that in MS
  lesions, activation of the noncanonical pathway may fail due to pathologic upregulation
  of TIP30, a protein that blocks nuclear transport of NICD. NICD entrapment in the
  cytoplasm prevents OPC differentiation and axon myelination (see schematic representation
  depicted in Figure 9 of the Nakahara et al. study; ref. ).
