caption: The effects of miR-320 on glucose and lipid metabolism in cardiomyocytes.
  (a) In an ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) model, miR-320 could target AKIP1 to
  induce the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and suppress the oxidative metabolism
  of glucose and lipid in cardiomyocytes. (b) miR-320 reduces the expression of IGF-1
  to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the case of I/R injury. (c) miR-320 reduces
  the expression of Survivin to induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis. (d) miR-320 targets
  to the CD36 promoter directly by forming a complex with Ago2 to enhance CD36 transcription
  and promote fatty acid transport. (e) The lipid accumulation activates PPAR-α signaling
  leading to the increased transcription of many genes involved in FFA oxidation and
  increases the expression of CD36 to improve the transport of FFA. AKIP1, A kinase
  interacting protein 1; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1.
