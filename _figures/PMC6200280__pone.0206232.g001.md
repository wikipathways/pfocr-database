caption: 'Solid line represents a chemical reaction and dashed line represents catalytic
  effect on a reaction. Three types of chemical reactions are involved in the model:
  phosphorylation, dephosphorylation and association-dissociation. Lckactive (= Lckya+Lckyiya)
  is the total active form of Lck and similarly CPactive (= CP1+CP2) is the total
  Shp2 bound to PD-1. The model equations and parameters are given in  and . The description
  of model variables are listed in Table A in .'
papertitle: Mathematical modeling identifies Lck as a potential mediator for PD-1
  induced inhibition of early TCR signaling.
