caption: The framework of our methodology applied in this study. The differentially
  expressed (DE) genes of diets, drugs and diseases were detected using the R package
  Rankprod, by comparison with respective control groups. The R package Gostats was
  applied for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The identified significant pathways
  for diets, drugs and diseases were used to construct the score matrix for the PCA.
  Diet-disease and drug-disease associations were calculated using the enrichment
  score (ES) method in DvD package. Hierarchical analysis was performed to show disease
  similarity based on the ES scores. Using a python script developed by Guney et al.
  (), we measured the proximity values between DE genes of diets or drugs and diseases
  within a human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Synergistic food pairs
  were identified using the approaches from Bansal et al. ().
