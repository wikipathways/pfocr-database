  therapeutically relevant concentrations inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated calcium

  activated GSK-3 by multiple mechanisms, leading to disinhibition of several transcription
  factors, such as CREB and HSF-1, and resulting in induction of major cytoprotective
  proteins such as BDNF, VEGF, MMP-9, HSP70, and Bcl-2. A decrease in GSK-3 activity
  further reduces the activity of pro-apoptotic protein p53 and its downregulating
  effect on Bcl-2. BDNF, via activating its cell surface receptor and the down-stream
  ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt pathways, induces neuroprotective effects in part by inhibiting
  GSK-3 and stimulating CREB. Induction of BDNF is an early and essential step for
  neuroprotection and is involved in lithium-induced neurogenesis. In addition, superinduction

  description: Proposed lithium’s neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia.
    The neuroprotective effects of lithium against cerebral ischemia are proposed
    to result from its interactions with cell survival and apoptotic machinery. A
    significant portion of brain damage following cerebral ischemia is caused by an
    increase in extracellular glutamate and subsequent over-stimulation of NMDA receptor-mediated
    toxic increase in intracellular calcium. This signaling pathway plays a critical
    role in mediating glutamate-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. Lithium
    at therapeutically relevant concentrations inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated calcium
    influx, which in turn decreases subsequent activation of JNK, p38 kinase, and
    transcription factor AP-1. Inhibition of intracellular calcium increase also attenuates
    the activity of calpain and calpain-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Cdk5/p25
    kinase. On the other hand, lithium can directly and indirectly reduce the activity
    of constitutively activated GSK-3 by multiple mechanisms, leading to disinhibition
    of several transcription factors, such as CREB and HSF-1, and resulting in induction
    of major cytoprotective proteins such as BDNF, VEGF, MMP-9, HSP70, and Bcl-2.
    A decrease in GSK-3 activity further reduces the activity of pro-apoptotic protein
    p53 and its downregulating effect on Bcl-2. BDNF, via activating its cell surface
    receptor and the down-stream ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt pathways, induces neuroprotective
    effects in part by inhibiting GSK-3 and stimulating CREB. Induction of BDNF is
