caption: Impact of AMXT 1501 on fatty acid synthesis, polyamine catabolism, and regulation.
  Genes encoding enzymes that utilize acetyl-CoA, derived from pyruvate, show significant
  downregulation (shown in red). Specifically, the expression of SPD0386, SPD0388,
  SPD0389, and SPD0390, which encode acetyl-CoA carboxylase biotin carboxyl carrier
  protein, acetyl-CoA carboxylase biotin carboxylase subunit, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  carboxyltransferase subunit beta, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase carboxyl transferase
  subunit alpha, respectively, involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA,
  is hindered. Furthermore, additional critical enzymes in the fatty acid synthesis
  pathway, including SPD0383 (ACP S-malonyltransferase), SPD0385 (beta-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase II), SPD0384 (3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase), SPD0387 (3-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  dehydratase FabZ), and SPD0382 (enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase FabK), which
  sequentially catalyze the formation of long-chain fatty acids from malonyl-CoA and
  its intermediates, are also downregulated. In an alternative pathway responsible
  for the catabolism and regulation of intracellular polyamines, acetyl-CoA is required
  to acetylate and remove excess polyamines. Upregulation of SPD1025 to SPD1028 (shown
  in blue) necessary for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA supports the notion
  of cells actively using available acetyl-CoA for polyamine regulation and export
  from the intracellular matrix rather than fatty acid synthesis
