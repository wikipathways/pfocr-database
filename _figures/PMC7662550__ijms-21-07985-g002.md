caption: Meiosis is induced by the expression of the Inducer of MEiosis 1 (IME1) gene
  which is regulated by both mating type and nutrient starvation. In nutrient-rich
  environments, IME1 is suppressed by the activities of target of rapamycin complex
  I (TORC1) and protein kinase A (PKA). While IME1 expression is activated by starvation
  signaling, it is also repressed by the gene products of the Regulator of MEiosis
  1 (RME1) and IME1 Regulatory Transcripts (IRT1). In both haploid cells (MATa and
  MATα), the absence of the a1-α2 complex permits expression of the RME1 gene. Then
  Rme1 transcribes a long noncoding RNA, the product of IRT1, which in turn represses
  IME1. The a1-α2 complex directly represses the expression of the RME1 gene, and
  the gene product of IME1 activates the meiosis pathway in MATa/α diploid cells in
  response to starvation.
