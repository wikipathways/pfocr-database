caption: Cholesterol is synthesized via the mevalonate pathway. Acetyl-CoA forms 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA (HMG-CoA) in several steps. The conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA
  to mevalonate, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, is catalyzed by
  HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), an enzyme within the endoplasmic reticulum. Rosuvastatin
  is an efficient competitive inhibitor of HMGR, reducing not only mevalonate levels,
  but also prenylated downstream products. The post-translational process of prenylation
  is needed for the function of small G proteins, including geranylgeranylation of
  Rho, Ras, and Rab, necessary for cellular signaling, transduction, and intermembrane
  translocation. As beneficial as statins are, there are obligatory molecular consequences
  inherent in their use, some related to their beneficial pleiotropic actions, but
  also to their side effects. Many steps and enzymes are omitted for clarity.
