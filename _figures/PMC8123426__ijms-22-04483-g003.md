caption: The VEGF receptor (VEGFR) consists of seven domains. VEGF binds to the VEGFR-2
  receptor, and then domains within the receptor and below the endothelial membrane
  are phosphorylated. Next, the phosphorylated domains activate RAF, which then activates
  MEK1/2, which, in turn, activates ERK1/2. Activated ERK1 or ERK2 either phosphorylates
  its target cytoplasmic proteins or translocates to the nucleus, where the main targets
  are transcription factors that regulate proliferation-, differentiation- or survival-related
  genes. Moreover, the activated VEGFR-2 can activate p38 MAPK and lead to the induction
  of endothelial cells’ migration. The last pathway associated with VEGFR-R leads
  to activation of PI3K and then Akt/PKB. Finally, the activation of this pathway
  leads to increased survival of ECs and vascular permeability.
