caption: Hh pathway response in vertebrates. (a) The signal sequence (SS) is removed
  from the Hh precursor protein, and the C-terminal domain autocatalytically adds
  a cholesterol adduct. Hhat, the target of RU-SKI 43, mediates the palmitoylation
  of the N-terminal signaling domain. Fully processed Hh (HhNp) is released from the
  membrane by Dispatched (Disp) and chaperoned to other cells by Scube. HhNp engages
  a receptor complex that includes Ptch, resulting in inactivation of Ptch and activation
  of Smo in the primary cilium. The Gli DNA-binding proteins in turn initiate transcription
  of target genes in response to Smo activation. Loss of Hh palmitoylation has been
  shown to affect Hh release from the producing cell membrane, distribution to neighboring
  cells and activity in responsive cells. (b) The MBOATs constitute a large family
  of extracellular acyltransferases that mediate diverse fatty acylation events, including
  those important to Wnt, Hh and Ghrelin signaling. RU-SKI 43 joins a growing portfolio
  of MBOAT inhibitors that may be therapeutically useful.
