caption: Strategies for therapeutic intervention of cancer involving FADD. (A) In
  lung cancer, CKIα-mediated phosphorylation of FADD leads to the translocation of
  S194-P-FADD to the nucleus, where it can induce expression of cyclins B1 and D1
  through NF-κB signaling [], or it can interact with key G2/M transition proteins
  like AURKA, PLK1 or BUB1 [], promoting cell cycle progression and proliferation.
  Inhibiting KRAS with Lonafarnib, MEK with PD0325901, or CK1α with CKI-7 decreased
  the abundance of phosphorylated FADD and decreased cell proliferation, apparently
  due to a loss of interaction between FADD and the G2/M transition proteins. As a
  result, tumor treated cells would fail to progress through G2/M. (B) Tamoxifen and
  paclitaxel in breast cancer [] and paclitaxel in prostate cancer [] have been reported
  to activate the MEKK1/MKK7/JNK pathway, which contributes to FADD phosphorylation.
  In breast cancer, this results in cell cycle arrest and suppression of cancer growth
  through p53 stabilization or Bcl-2 phosphorylation. In prostate cancer, phosphorylated
  FADD in turn upregulates MEKK1 and downstream JNK1 activation, which is essential
  for sensitization to apoptosis induced by etoposide or cisplatin combined with paclitaxel
  []. Thus, chemosensitization can be amplified through FADD phosphorylation and the
  MEKK1/MKK7/JNK1 pathway. (C) In head and neck cancer, the SMAC mimetic Birinapant
  plus radiation induces tumor regression []. Radiation induces DNA damage and in
  consequence the intrinsic cell death pathway through mitochondrial release of SMAC.
  The negative effect of SMAC on IAPs is enhanced by SMAC mimetic Birinapant, resulting
  in degradation of IAPs to enhance FADD-involving DR-induced apoptosis. In chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia, the HDAC inhibitor Romidepsin sensitizes tumor cells to TRAIL-induced
  apoptosis through enhancement of FADD recruitment to the DISC []. In ovarian cancer,
  the combination of the BH3-mimetic molecule AT-101 with cisplatin strongly sensitize
  cells towards apoptosis; they inhibit HDAC and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzyme
  activities and they induce FADD expression among other apoptosis-related genes [].
  Carboplatin and Nortriptyline also favor FADD expression in tongue carcinoma []
  and bladder cancer cells [], respectively.
