caption: Adrenal cholesterol biosynthesis pathway gene expression is globally underexpressed
  in the Chga knockout mouse. Adrenal expression patterns of genes involved in cholesterol
  biosynthesis were mapped onto a biochemical pathway diagram with GenMAPP. The statistically
  significant and global underexpression of the pathway, including 2.60-fold underexpression
  of HMG-CoA reductase (Hmgcr), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis,
  suggests a reduction in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis in the adrenal gland of
  the Chga knockout mouse. Genes overexpressed in the Chga knockout are colored red,
  genes underexpressed in the Chga knockout are colored blue, genes lacking a statistically
  significant change are colored gray, and genes without expression data (i.e., the
  gene lacked a probe on the microarray) are shown in white. Numbers adjacent to genes
  indicate the fold change of differential expression. A positive number indicates
  a gene that is overexpressed in the knockout (Chga KO mean signal/wild-type mean
  signal), and a negative number refers to a gene that is underexpressed in the knockout
  (−wild-type mean signal/Chga KO mean signal).
