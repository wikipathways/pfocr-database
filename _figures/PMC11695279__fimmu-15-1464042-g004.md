caption: Mechanism of m6A-mediated tumor regulation in the immune microenvironment.
  For example, in ovarian cancer, METTL3 affects NK cell-mediated immunity by regulating
  the APK/MAPK signaling pathway. IGF2BP3 further influences the immune response of
  CD8-positive T cells in lung cancer by positively regulating deubiquitination of
  PD-L1. Therefore, m6A regulators are essential for the regulation of tumor immune
  effects
