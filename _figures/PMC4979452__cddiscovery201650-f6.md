caption: Protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. The majority of G-protein coupled
  receptors (GPCR) are associated with activation of distinctive adenylate cyclases
  (ACs) to regulate intracellular cAMP levels. When active, AC produces the second
  messenger cAMP in response to a wide range of signal-transduction pathways. The
  main target of cAMP is PKA. Some of the major substrates of PKA include GSK3. PKA
  phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3, preventing neurodegeneration. PKA also phosphorylates
  the transcription factor CREB, which in turn allows the recruitment of the coactivator
  CREB-binding protein (CBP). Thus, PKA is important for an increasing number of physiological
  processes, such as regulation of the cell cycle that involves chromatin condensation
  and decondensation. Apart from PKA, other direct targets of cAMP include PDE, p70S6K/RPS6KB1
  and PLA2. Pathway objects and links are described separately in .
