caption: 'Scleraxis (red text) regulation of gene expression in fibrosis. Extracellular
  matrix (ECM) synthesis and processing require large quantities of ATP, which may
  be derived from various intracellular metabolic pathways, including fatty acid b-oxidation,
  glycolysis, glucose oxidation, and glutaminolysis. Key enzymes of each pathway are
  depicted, including those of glutaminolysis (green text). Red arrows highlight mechanisms
  that may contribute to cardiac fibrosis: scleraxis regulates GLS1 expression, per
  the present results, and shows evidence of regulation of other glutaminolysis enzyme
  genes. Scleraxis also directly transactivates a variety of pro-fibrotic genes, including
  ECM components Col1α2 and EDA-Fn; thus, scleraxis may regulate fibrosis by controlling
  both ECM gene expression and glutaminolysis genes to provide the energy necessary
  to support fibrosis.'
