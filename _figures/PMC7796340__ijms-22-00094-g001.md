caption: Collateral glucose-utilizing pathways associated with diabetic polyneuropathy.
  Glycolysis is a central pathway involved in glucose metabolism. There are several
  collateral glucose-utilizing pathways, such as the polyol pathway, PKC pathway,
  glycation, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway including glucosamine metabolism, pentose
  phosphate pathway, and anaerobic glycolytic pathway. AGE, advanced glycation end-product;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; Glut, glucose transporter; PKC, protein kinase C; TCA cycle,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle.
