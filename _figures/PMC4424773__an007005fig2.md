caption: Proposed signaling pathway for fat taste. (1a) CD36 may act as a binding
  protein for FFAs, such as linoleic acid. It is unclear whether and how CD36, when
  bound to an FFA, interacts with GPR120 and other membrane proteins. However, evidence
  in mice indicates that GPR120 and CD36 have different roles in signaling, with CD36
  being more reliant on FFAs and GPR120 being activated by a non-FFA mechanism. The
  presence of CD36 and GPR120 also varies on the basis of BMI, dietary intake, and
  fasting state. (1b) The binding of FFAs to GPR120 leads to increased signaling in
  Gαgus and PLC-β. FFAs and CD36 may interact directly with PLC-β. (1c) FFAs (e.g.,
  arachidonic acid) can intracellularly activate TRPM5 channels. Intracellular Ca2+
  can also directly interact with TRPM5 channels. (2) Na+ passes through the channel
  into the intracellular membrane. The result of these various signaling mechanisms
  is an increase in intracellular Ca2+ (released from IP3 channels on the endoplasmic
  reticulum). (3a) The Ca2+ release ultimately leads to membrane depolarization, with
  positive feedback. With the increase in intracellular Ca2+, TRPM5 channels are activated.
  (3b) STIM1, which detects lowered Ca2+ concentrations in the endoplasmic reticulum,
  may aid in the activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels such as CRACs. This, in
  conjunction with other channels, such as TRPM5, directly interacting with Ca2+ allows
  for continued membrane depolarization. (3c) The membrane potential also interacts
  with and opens DRK channels, such as KCN5, whereas extracellular FFAs are channel
  blockers. (4) Depolarization is therefore prolonged with the presence of more FFAs,
  with CD36 possibly aiding in the interaction between DRK channels and FFAs. The
  depolarization ultimately causes neurotransmitter release. CRAC, calcium release-activation
  channel; DRK, delayed rectifying K+ channel; GPR120, G protein–coupled receptor
  120; IP3, inositol triphosphate 3; IP3R, inositol triphosphate 3 receptor; KCN5,
  potassium volate-gated channel, shaker-related subfamily, member 5; NT, neurotransmitter;
  PLCβ, phospholipase C β; STIM1, stromal interaction molecule; TRPM5, transient receptor
  potential cation channel subfamily M, member 5.
