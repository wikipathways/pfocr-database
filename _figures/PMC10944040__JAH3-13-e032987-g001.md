caption: 'IL‐1 binding to IL‐1R1 results in a cascade of activation and phosphorylation,
  which ultimately promotes NF‐κB nuclear translocation and transcription and formation
  of pro‐IL‐1β. After the generation of pro‐IL‐1β (the inactive form of IL‐1β: 31
  kDa), the inflammasome complex is assembled in response to a second stimulus, such
  as ATP activation of P2X7 receptors. Following this, the inflammasome complex is
  assembled, and procaspase‐1 is cleaved into active caspase‐1, which cleaves pro‐IL‐1
  into various forms including the mature 17‐kDa IL‐1β. IL‐1β can be released as a
  soluble (membrane‐unbound/ free) or a vesicular (membrane‐bound) form. Throughout
  the decades of research on IL‐1β, different mechanisms for mature IL‐1β release
  have been proposed, suggesting that IL‐1 secretion is not a unified mechanism but
  rather the release varies according to cell type and is context‐ and stimulus‐dependent.
  The proposed mechanisms for soluble IL‐1 secretion are: microvesicular shedding
  mechanisms (A); exocytosis pathways of multivesicular bodies and /or exosome release
  (B); direct IL‐1 release through a hyperpermeable plasma membrane (C); IL‐1 release
  by lysosomal exocytosis (D): following caspase‐1 activation, secretory lysosomes
  fuse to the plasma membrane and release their IL‐1β contents by a process of exocytosis,
  release by gasdermin D or other pore (E). A combination of release mechanisms could
  occur in various repair or pathological settings. Boxes have also been depicted
  in this figure to show sites in the mechanistic release process of IL‐1 that would
  be affected by therapeutic intervention. Therapeutics mentioned are further expounded
  upon in the Table. GSDMD indicates gasdermin D; IL‐1β, interleukin‐1 beta; IL‐1R1,
  interleukin‐1 receptor type‐I; IL‐1Ra, IL‐1 receptor antagonist; IKKB, I‐kappa‐B
  kinase B; IRAK1/4, interleukin‐1 receptor‐associated kinase 1/4; NF‐κB, nuclear
  factor‐kappa B; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain, leucine‐rich repeat
  family pyrin domain‐containing 3; and TLR, toll‐like receptor'
