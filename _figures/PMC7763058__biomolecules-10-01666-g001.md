caption: TGF-β signaling in fibroblasts. TGF-β signals start when the TGF-β ligand
  binds to TGF-β type II receptors (TGF-βRII), and phosphorylates TGF-β type I (TGF-βRI),
  activating various intracellular signaling cascades. Intracellular pathways activated
  by TGF-β include the canonical SMAD2/3 pathway and non-canonical TGF-β pathways,
  such as Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCKs), MAP kinases
  (ERK), and PI3K/AKT, which can regulate myofibroblast generation, fibroblast proliferation/apoptosis,
  and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein production. Activated small mothers against
  decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) proteins or phosphorylated mediators of non-canonical
  signaling translocate into the nucleus and interact with DNA by transcription factors
  (TF), co-activators (CA, such as p53), and co-repressors (CR) to regulate gene expression,
  resulting in increased myofibroblast generation, elevated ECM protein production
  and increased pro-fibrotic factor connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) to promote
  fibrosis. The black characters/arrows indicate mediators/processes that promote
  fibrosis, and red characters indicate inhibitors of TGF-β signaling-mediated fibrosis
  in fibroblasts.
