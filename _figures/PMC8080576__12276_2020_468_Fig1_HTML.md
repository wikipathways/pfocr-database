caption: This schematic outlines some of the major signaling pathways in astrocytes.
  Changes in astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ levels depend on a number of activities
  by receptors, channels, pores, and other cellular components. Therefore, each component
  or process illustrated in this figure is also a possible intervention point to control
  intracellular Ca2+ levels. The components are roughly classified into several categories.
  Manipulating the activity of membrane proteins can be done using antagonists and
  blockers. GPCRs include mAChR, GABAB, and NMDAR, and the GPCR-IP3pathway can also
  be regulated by controlling IP3R2 activity. Other membrane proteins, such as TRP
  channels, ion channels, and voltage-gated calcium channels (not shown), are also
  responsible for the Ca2+response in astrocytes. Elevated astrocyte Ca2+ often leads
  to altered gene expression and SNARE-based gliotransmission. Although the gliotransmitter
  released varies between brain regions, dominant-negative SNARE proteins can be utilized
  to restrict gliotransmission.
