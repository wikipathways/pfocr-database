caption: Illustration of the proposed immuno-deficiency (IMD) signaling pathway in
  shrimp. Upon binding of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to the scavenger receptor class
  B2 (SRB2) — a proposed mechanism for crustaceans since no peptidoglycan recognition
  proteins (PGRPs) have been described—the pathway is initiated. This interaction
  leads to the recruitment and activation of DREDD via ubiquitination mediated by
  IAP2. Activated DREDD cleaves IMD, exposing a binding site for IAP2, which facilitates
  K63-ubiquitination of IMD. The K63-polyubiquitinated IMD recruits TAK1 through TAB2,
  activating the I-kappa B kinase (IKK) complex and mitogen-activated protein kinases
  (MAPK) pathways, specifically MKK4, MKK6, and MKK7. Notably, in crustaceans, p38
  is activated by MKK4 and MKK6 through phosphorylation, paralleling human immune
  signaling mechanisms. This bifurcated signaling cascade culminates in the activation
  of Relish and AP-1 transcription factors, including c-Jun and c-Fos, which translocate
  to the nucleus and trigger the transcription of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes,
  orchestrating the immune response against bacterial infection. Created in BioRender.
