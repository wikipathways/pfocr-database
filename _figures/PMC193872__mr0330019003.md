caption: 'Conserved longevity-regulatory pathways in S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and
  possibly humans. There are two ways to study longevity in S. cerevisiae: replicative
  (mitotic) life span and chronological (nonmitotic) life span. Both these approaches
  have identified yeast genes with functional homologues in a conserved insulin-like
  signaling longevity pathway. These include SIR2, which encodes an NAD+-dependent
  deacetylase, RAS, which encodes a GTP-binding protein, and SCH9, which encodes a
  serine/threonine kinase. These findings are consistent with the idea that longevity
  regulation is highly adaptive and that components of a primordial pathway have been
  conserved in a diverse range of species.'
