caption: Molecular regulation of muscle protein turnover. Muscle protein synthesis
  is regulated by several signals including energy status, amino acids, and growth
  factors, for example, insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This leads to the activation
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Protein kinase B (Akt) regulates muscle protein
  turnover through the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
  and inhibition of Forkhead box O (FOXO). In turn, the activation of mTORC1 leads
  to the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1)
  and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) that contribute to muscle protein synthesis.
  Muscle protein breakdown can be activated by inflammatory cytokines, for example,
  tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which subsequently leads to the activation of nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB), myostatin, and the ubiquitin ligase Muscle RING finger-1 (MuRF-1).
  Furthermore, activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway through FOXO can increase
  MuRF-1 and muscle atrophy-box (MAFbx).
