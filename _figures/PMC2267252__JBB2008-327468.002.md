caption: Apoptosis map. Expression data of Rhok−/−/Sag−/− mice was overlaid onto a
  hypothetical apoptosis map using the GenMAPP (http://www.genmapp.org) program. Each
  rectangle represents a gene in the pathway. The number on the right of the rectangle
  corresponds to the log 2 ratio. Genes highlighted in yellow are unchanged. Pink
  and red denote upregulated genes while dark and light green correspond to downregulated
  genes. Rhok−/−/Sag−/− mice were exposed to 1 hour of low light (450 lux) and adapted
  for the indicated time period of darkness.
