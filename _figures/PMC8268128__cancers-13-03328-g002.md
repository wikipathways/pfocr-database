caption: Summary of the crosstalk between the EVs derived from adipose tissues (AT-EVs)
  and several types of cancers. EVs released from adipose tissue macrophages are enriched
  in miR-155, whereas miR-144 is downregulated inducing inhibition of p53 and decreased
  apoptosis in breast cancer cells. AT-EVs increase phosphorylation of cAMP response
  element-binding (CREB) protein increasing the proliferation of breast cancer cells.
  AT-EVs increase the proliferation of breast cancer cells via induction of procollagen
  galactosyltransferase 2 (COLGALT2). AT-EVs increase extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways inducing an increase in the proliferation
  of breast cancer cells. AT-EVs enriched in SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX-9)
  induce tumorigenesis in breast cancer cells. AT-EVs from diabetic patients are enriched
  in epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1)/interleukin 6 (IL-6) and induce an
  increase in migration and invasion of breast cancer cells via Janus kinase (JAK)/signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) signaling. AT-EVs increase
  TGF-β/SMAD signaling pathway triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  in non-metastatic breast cancer cells. AT-EVs induce PI3K/AKT signaling in MDA-MB-231
  cells, thus increasing their migratory capacity. AT-EVs induce yes-associated protein
  1 (YAP) and taffazin (TAZ) inducing cell growth in breast cancer cells. AT-EVs decrease
  apoptosis in breast cancer cells. AT-EVs enriched in mitochondrial fission protein
  1 (FIS-1) and mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase (OPA-1) induce mitochondrial redistribution
  toward the edge of melanoma cells increasing their migratory capacity. AT-EVs and
  EVs derived from cancer-associated adipocytes (CAA) fuel free fatty acids to melanoma
  cells and increase fatty acid oxidation (FAO) increasing their migratory and invasive
  capacities. AT-EVs increase metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) in lung cancer cells increasing
  their invasiveness. AT-EVs increase tumor progression of lung cancer. AT-EVs increase
  FAO and induce tumor progression in prostate cancer. AT-EVs enriched in circulating
  RNAs (circ-RNAs) induce hypophosphorylation of ubiquitin-specific-processing protease
  7 (USP-7) and an increase in cyclin in hepatocarcinoma cells. AT-EVs induce malignancy
  of hepatocarcinoma cells via hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF-1α) binding to the
  von-Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). AT-EVs decrease apoptosis and increase
  chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells via inhibition of the apoptotic peptidase
  activator factor 1 (APAF-1). AT-EVs enriched in miR-31, interleukin 8 (IL-8), C-C
  motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), and vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D)
  induce the formation of tube-like structures by endothelial cells. AT-EVs enriched
  in miR-132 induce lymphangiogenesis via transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)/Smad
  signaling. CAA undergo increased lipolysis and differentiate toward beige/brown
  adipocytes phenotype fueling tumor cells with EVs. Leptin released from AT is possibly
  within EVs and induces an increase in telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) activity
  inducing resistance to apoptosis and senescence. Leptin, TNF-α, and IL-6 may be
  released from AT-EVs, inducing CD8+ T cells’ exhaustion.
