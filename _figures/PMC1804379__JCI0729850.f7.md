caption: Under basal conditions, Dot1a and Af9 form a nuclear complex that directly
  or indirectly binds specific sites of the ENaCα promoter, leading to hypermethylation
  of histone H3 Lys79 and repression of ENaCα transcription. Aldosterone stimulates
  ENaCα transcription by regulating 2 different pathways. In the classical pathway,
  aldosterone binds and activates the nuclear hormone receptors (NR) that are either
  glucocorticoid receptor and/or mineralocorticoid receptor homo- or heterodimers
  to bind the glucocorticoid response element in the ENaCα promoter and transactivate
  ENaCα. In a parallel pathway, aldosterone releases the repression of ENaCα by (a)
  downregulating Dot1a () and Af9 expression (), and thus the amount of Dot1a-Af9
  complex, presumably via nuclear receptor–dependent or –independent (not shown) mechanisms
  and/or (b) decreasing the Dot1a-Af9 interaction via Sgk1-mediated phosphorylation
  of Af9 to limit their availability, leading to histone H3 Lys79 hypomethylation
  at specific subregions of the ENaCα promoter. Sgk1 might join and downregulate the
  Dot1a-Af9 complex associated with the ENaCα promoter (not shown for simplicity).
  In all cases, Af9-free Dot1a binds DNA nonspecifically and catalyzes histone H3
  Lys79 methylation throughout the genome under basal conditions (not shown). A hypothetical
  opposing interaction between the nuclear receptor–aldosterone complex and the Dot1a-Af9
  complex (dotted line) may tune the ultimate level of ENaCα transcription. Meth,
  methylation.
