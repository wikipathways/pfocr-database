caption: Model of GAS virulence regulation by environmental pH and SIP. At low-bacterial
  population density and near-neutral environmental pH (left panel), the deprotonated
  side chain of H144 destabilizes the intramolecular interactions with Y176, Y182’,
  and E185’. The weakened interactions at the base of the SIP-binding pocket inhibit
  high-affinity RopB–SIP interactions resulting in defective RopB–DNA interactions
  and decreased RopB-dependent transcription activation of SIP and speB. At high-population
  density (right panel), environmental pH decreases to pH 5.5, resulting in acidification
  of the GAS cytosol. When the intracellular pH becomes closer to the pKa of histidine
  (pH ~6.2), the protonated side chain of RopB H144 facilitates the interactions with
  Y176, Y182’, and E185’. The stabilized intramolecular interactions at acidic pH
  promote high-affinity RopB–SIP interactions. The high-affinity RopB–DNA interactions
  and RopB polymerization aided by SIP binding leads to upregulation of SIP expression,
  which then triggers robust induction of SIP production by a positive feedback mechanism.
  Finally, SIP-dependent upregulation of speB results in secretion of SpeB zymogen
  (SpeBZ). The acidified extracellular environment promotes rapid maturation of SpeBZ
  to SpeBM, and maximal protease activity of SpeBM, facilitating disease progression
  by cleaving various host and GAS proteins
