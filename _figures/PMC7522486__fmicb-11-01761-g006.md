caption: Positive role of SigB in the biocontrol proficiency of PGPB B. subtilis.
  This cartoon summarizes the beneficial interaction between surfactin-producing B.
  subtilis cells and plants to resist phytopathogenic fungi. Biofilm- and surfactin-proficient
  B. subtilis cells can establish a beneficial biofilm at the plant rhizosphere and
  detect the fungal presence around them. The signal of fungal presence is transduced
  to the bacterium by an unknown signal that activates the energy stress pathway (PQ
  in the cartoon) of the SigB regulatory network. Active SigB increases the synthesis
  of the antifungal lipopeptide surfactin which is exported from the cell through
  the channel SwrC and/or free cellular membrane diffusion (not shown for simplicity).
  Outside the bacterial cells, surfactin exerts its fungal growth inhibitory effect.
  Additionally, surfactins have other two important properties. First, they are important
  molecules for the proficiency of bacilli at establishing robust and persistent beneficial
  biofilms at the plant rhizosphere, and second, they can induce plant systemic resistance
  (ISR) against pathogens. It has been reported that there is specific positive feedback
  (not shown in the figure for simplicity) from the plant to the bacterium, in which
  plant polysaccharides stimulate B. subtilis biofilm formation. See the text for
  details.
