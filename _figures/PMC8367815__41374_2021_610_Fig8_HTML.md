caption: This study demonstrates that AOPPs significantly decrease the CYP1A2 and
  CYP3A4 expression and activities via direct activation of the NF-κB pathway and
  induction of nuclear translocation of NF-κB to inhibit the transcription and translation
  of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. As inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and/or TNF-α may mediate this
  process.
