caption: Schematic model for implication of the cell integrity pathway in the ΔkexB
  (A) and wild-type (B) strains. The cell integrity MAP kinase pathway is shown by
  the dotted box. pkcA (), mpkA (), and rlmA (Fujioka et al., unpublished; accession
  no. BAD01583) were isolated from Aspergillus fungi. The yeast BCK1 and MKK1 orthologs
  have not yet been isolated from Aspergillus species; however, putative ORFs (bckA,
  mkkA) homologous to the two genes are found in A. oryzae genome sequences (O. Mizutani,
  K. Abe, and T. Nakajima, unpublished data). The cell integrity pathway in the ΔkexB
  strain is constitutively activated (A), although the pathway is not activated (resting)
  unless the wild-type strain senses some stress such as hypoosmolarity (B). A. oryzae
  KexB is predicted to be required for precise proteolytic processing of sensor proteins
  in the cell integrity pathway and/or of cell wall-related enzymes whose genes are
  under transcriptional control by the pathway.
