caption: Model of relationship among Hfe, Tmprss6, and the Bmp/Smad signaling pathway
  in hepcidin regulation. Our data are compatible with a model in which Hfe promotes
  Bmp/Smad signaling for hepcidin production by inhibiting the activity of Tmprss6
  (A). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Hfe promotes Bmp/Smad signaling
  by a mechanism that is independent of Tmprss6 but nevertheless cannot achieve a
  further elevation in Bmp/Smad target gene expression when Tmprss6 is absent. Hfe
  might, for example, promote Bmp/Smad signaling by Hjv (B) or promote Bmp/Smad signaling
  at a point functionally downstream of Tmprss6 (C).
