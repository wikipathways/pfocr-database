caption: A. Heatmap and fold change in expression of all genes associated with NF-λB
  signaling that were identified as being significantly up-regulated in the spleen
  following urethane treatment of Nlrx1−/− mice compared to the urethane treated wild
  type animals. Analysis was based on the ΔΔCt method, where all data was standardized
  to the average gene expression for a panel of 8 housekeeping genes and normalized
  to the respective untreated Nlrx1−/− and untreated wild type spleens. Greater than
  a 2-fold change in gene expression was considered significant. Three – five randomly
  selected spleens from each genotype and treatment group were selected and pooled
  for profiling studies. B. Evaluation of all gene expression data using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis revealed a significant increase in NF-λB and AKT signaling in Nlrx1−/−
  spleens following urethane exposure compared to wild type. Pink icons represents
  genes that were significantly up-regulated (>2 fold change in expression) in the
  Nlrx1−/− spleens compared to the change in expression observed in the wild type
  spleens following urethane treatment. Nlrx1−/− urethane, n=5; wild type urethane,
  n=5; Nlrx1−/− saline, n=5; wild type saline, n=5.
