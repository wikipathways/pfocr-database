caption: Lut alleviates I/R injury by inhibiting apoptosis by up-regulating AKT, increasing
  BCL-2 protein and decreasing BAX protein. SERCA2a is the key protein involved in
  Ca2+ uptake from the cytosol into the SR. SERCA2a activity is improved after activation
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; at the same time, Lut works as a p38 MAPK pathway
  inhibitor to suppress the phosphorylation of PLN, thereby enhancing the activity
  of SERCA2a and reducing the Ca2+ overload. Oxidative stress is blocked by Lut through
  HO-1, which enhances the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE. Lut inhibits JUK and increases
  p-ERK1/2 to enhance the contraction of cardiomyocytes. Lut up-regulates the myocardial
  eNOS pathway and inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore to protect
  the heart against I/R injury.
