caption: 'Induction of ferroptosis by FIN56. FIN56 promotes ferroptosis by two distinct
  mechanisms: (i) negative regulation of GPX4 protein levels and (ii) activation of
  squalene synthase (SQS), which acts downstream of HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate
  pathway. In one mechanism (purple boxes), FIN56 promotes degradation of GPX4 in
  a process that requires acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activity. Inhibition of ACC
  by TOFA suppresses the FIN56-mediated degradation of GPX4, yet the link between
  FIN56, ACC and GPX4 degradation is not clear (gray dashed arrows). In the second
  mechanism (blue boxes), FIN56 binds and activates SQS, the enzyme that converts
  farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to squalene, which ultimately reduces the pool of FPP
  available for protein prenylation and metabolite synthesis, leading to coenzyme
  Q10 (CoQ10) depletion, for example (black arrows). Inhibition of SQS increases the
  pool of available FPP and its derived products, suppressing ferroptosis. GPX4, glutathione
  peroxidase 4; TOFA, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A.'
