caption: MiR-155 targets AGTR1 resulting in reduced NF-κB signaling and CXCR4 levels
  thereby attenuating their associated oncogenic properties. Schematic representation
  of AGTR1 downstream signaling leading to activation of NF-κB pathway which in turn
  increases CXCR4 expression and mediates feedback upregulation of AGTR1 (left panel).
  Right panel depicts post-transcriptional regulation of AGTR1 via miR-155 which leads
  to reduced NF-κB signaling, decrease in CXCR4 expression and inhibition of feedback
  regulatory loop. Collectively, miR-155 disrupts the oncogenic NF-κB/CXCR4/AGTR1
  signaling axis in GBM thereby decreasing AGTR1-mediated tumorigenesis.
