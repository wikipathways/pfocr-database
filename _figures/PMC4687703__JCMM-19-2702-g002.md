caption: 'The local inhibition of miR‐24 in ECs would turn off apoptosis signalling
  pathway and improves reparative angiogenesis in post‐ischaemic conditions. The mechanism
  used by miR‐24 to switch between angiogenesis and apoptosis in ECs. (A) The pro‐apoptotic
  and anti‐angiogenic effects of miR‐24 in ECs, are mediated by repressing downstream
  mediators: PAK4, GATA2, heme‐oxygenase‐1 (HMOX1), SIRT1. GATA2 induces the expression
  of SIRT1 and HMOX1. (B) A special miRNA can regulate the multiple genes and the
  major signalling pathway of a cell. The signal transduction factor RASA1; the chromatin
  remodelling factor H2AX and HIF‐1α pathway are the other major targets of miR‐24
  in ECs.'
