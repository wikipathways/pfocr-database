caption: Proposed mechanisms by which CR13626 could act in GBM. The treatment with
  CR13626 could act both on endothelial and GBM tumor cells through the inhibition
  of VEGFR2 and EGFR and the downstream kinase Fyn, leading to a diminished tumor
  cells proliferation, migration, and counteracting the angiogenesis process. On GBM
  tumor cells, CR13626 can block the constitutively active form of EGFR receptor (EGFR
  vIII), which is the most frequent deletion occurring in GBM. Moreover, the inhibition
  of Yes kinase could contribute to a less invasion phenotype of GBM. By acting on
  the Lck kinase downstream the activated c-kit receptor, CR13626 could reduce cancer
  cells stemness and counteract the GBM resistance to TMZ. The inhibition of Fyn and
  HGK kinases could impair the c-MET receptor signaling pathway and decrease GBM migration
  and invasion. Finally, CR13626 could counteract one of the EGFR resistance mechanisms
  by blocking RET kinase.
