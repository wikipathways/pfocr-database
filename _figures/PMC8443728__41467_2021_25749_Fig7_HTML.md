caption: a NLRP3 inflammasome activation through ATP-P2X7 signaling pathway in phagocytic
  cells. b ATP released from chlamydiae infected oviduct epithelial cells (Fig. )
  and luminal neutrophils function (i) directly through penetrating the lamina propria
  facilitated by matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) degradation of extracellular matrix
  molecules that has been shown to amplify the inflammatory response to chlamydial
  infection, or (ii) by paracrine/autocrine via P2R cascading purinergic signaling
  and exacerbation of the macrophage inflammatory response. Because immunopathology
  occurs independently of the IL-1R and various PAMPs, we propose the processed N-terminal
  IL-1α is translocated to the nucleus to transcriptionally regulate pro-inflammatory
  cytokines which drive immunopathology. Notably, macrophage-associated immunopathology
  occurred independently of detectable chlamydial infection (Fig. ) presenting a model
  where mucosal infection generated DAMP signaling, which triggers sterile macrophage-associated
  inflammation in submucosal tissue.
