caption: Model of a potential regulatory pathway involved in Rhopr-TRET transcript
  expression in the fat body and ovaries of females of Rhodnius prolixus during unfed
  and fed stages. In R. prolixus, after a blood meal, we propose that insulin signaling
  is activated in ovaries and fat body and, along with other regulatory mechanisms,
  triggers vitellogenesis (). Here, we demonstrate that trehalose content increases
  in the fat body and ovaries as days post-blood meal progress, as do the circulating
  levels in the hemolymph. We suggest that insulin-signaling activation, via Rhopr-IR1
  (InR), is involved in Rhopr-TRET transcript expression that could then result in
  mediating a TRET facilitated bidirectional transfer of trehalose; the release of
  trehalose from the fat body and the uptake by the ovaries, satisfying the physiological
  needs required for egg formation. The potential up-regulation of Rhopr-TRET transcript
  via Rhopr-AKH signaling during vitellogenesis is also suggested, as well as a positive
  feedback of hemolymph trehalose levels on insulin signaling. In the unfed condition,
  Rhopr-AKH signaling might be involved in the release of trehalose from ovaries via
  Rhopr-TRET, thereby providing a source of energy for the insect during stressful
  situations such as starvation. The role of AKH signaling in promoting the glycolysis
  in unfed conditions to generate glucose as an energy source and/or trehalose to
  carbohydrate mobilization, as well as the release of Rhopr-ILP1/Rhopr-IGF and Rhopr-AKH
  after feeding, are assumed (gray dashed arrows). Rhopr-AKHR (AKHR).
