caption: Proposed signaling pathway of ITPs in B. mori. BNGR-A2 and -A34 function
  as ITP receptor. BNGR-A24, a putative receptor for TRPs, acts as an ITPL receptor
  rather than a receptor for ITP because of its low affinity with ITP. ITPs increase
  intracellular cGMP by activation of both membrane-bound BmGyc76c and NO-sensitive
  sGC, which is inhibited by ODQ. The signaling pathway via NO-sensitive sGC is shown
  in reference to the accepted signaling pathway for MIH in decapod crustaceans ().
  In brief, activation of receptors for ITPs results in cAMP production by adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) via G protein (G), and subsequent activation of cAMP-dependent protein
  kinase (PKA). PKA increases intracellular Ca2+ via the Ca2+ channel, consequently
  activating calmodulin (CaM). Calmodulin stimulates NO production by NO synthase
  (NOS), leading to activation of NO-sensitive sGC. Chronically elevated intracellular
  cAMP and cGMP activate PKA and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), respectively.
  These effectors contribute to multiple functions exhibited by ITPs, probably including
  ion homeostasis.
