  of , ,  and in vivo, and also known pathways in vitro. Grey boxes show excitatory
  stimuli in vivo; stippled boxes with dotted lines show inhibitors investigated here
  and by . IP3, inositol trisphosphate; Ras, a monomeric G-protein implicated in the
  activation of both the p38–MAP kinase and MEK–ERK pathway. Many aspects of this
  working hypothesis remain untested.
