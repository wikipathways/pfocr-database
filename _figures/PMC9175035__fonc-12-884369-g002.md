caption: 'Methods to facilitate the release of EVs. ① Acute Hypoxia: Catabolism of
  HIF-1α is inhibited by acute hypoxia, which stabilizes the P53 gene and activates
  the P21 gene, leading to apoptosis and promoting the release of EVs (–). ② UV: After
  UV irradiation, a large number of free radicals are generated to attack nucleic
  acids and proteins, causing apoptosis and increasing the release of EVs (). ③ Photodynamic
  Treatment: Laser irradiation at a specific wavelength excites the tissue-absorbing
  photosensitizer, and the excited state of the photosensitizer transmits energy to
  the surrounding oxygen, generating strongly reactive monomorphic oxygen, which may
  reacts oxidatively with the surrounding neighboring biomolecules, resulting in a
  cytotoxic effect that causes apoptosis and also promoting the release of EVs ().
  ④ Complement Proteins: The membrane attack complex (MAC) is composed of complement
  proteins (C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9). MAC is cleared from the cell surface by cytosolic
  or cytocytic action to help release EVs (, ). ⑤ Chemotherapy: The use of chemotherapeutic
  agents (e.g., doxorubicin, methotrexate, and cisplatin) causes cellular damage and
  EVs release (, ). ⑥ Toxic Lipids: Toxic lipids activates the DR5 pro-apoptotic signaling
  cascade, which in turn activates ROCK1 and promotes the release of EVs from hepatocytes
  (). ⑦ Nutritional Deficiency: Activation of Caspase 3, ROCK1 signaling pathway and
  promotion the release of EVs (). ⑧ Infection factors () and ⑨ focused ultrasound
  () can also promote the release of EVs.'
