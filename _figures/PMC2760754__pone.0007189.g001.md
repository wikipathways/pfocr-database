caption: a Agonist (the triangle) binding to receptor activates a G protein, , which
  in turn activates an effector protein, . For simplicity, the G protein is always
  bound to the receptor, and we show explicitly neither G and G nor the deactivation
  of the G protein. b The Gpathway. The effector protein is the  isoform of phospholipase
  C. When activated, PLC cleaves the phospholipid PIP into membrane-bound DAG and
  cytosolic IP. High IP concentrations cause the release of calcium ions from the
  endoplasmic reticulum. PKC when bound by calcium is recruited to the membrane by
  DAG and becomes activated. c The Gpathway. The effector protein is adenylyl cyclase
  which synthesizes cAMP from ATP when activated. d The increased concentrations of
  cytosolic cAMP activate PKA by binding to its inhibitory domain.
