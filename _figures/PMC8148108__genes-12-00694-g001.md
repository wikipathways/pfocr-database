caption: 'AsA metabolic pathways in tomato. The main biosynthetic pathway occurring
  via l-galactose is shown in brown, the d-galacturonate pathway in green, the d-glucuronate
  pathway in blue, and the AsA recycling pathway in black. Purple symbolizes a reaction
  taking place in the apoplast. Efficient manipulations of structural genes in either
  leaves (green) or fruits (red) via transgenic efforts are presented on the left
  of the reactions with blue arrows, followed by their impact on the AsA pool (increase,
  decrease, or stable). The fold change >1.5 (overexpression) or <0.5 (silencing)
  of the AsA contents in transgenic plants compared to wild-type plants was regarded
  as efficient manipulation. The full list of transgenic approaches is given in Table
  1. Regulatory factors affecting positively or negatively the transcription of structural
  genes are also presented with arrows on the right of the reaction. PGI: Phosphoglucose
