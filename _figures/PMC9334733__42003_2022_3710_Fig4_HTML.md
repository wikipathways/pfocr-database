caption: It was formed by the direct interaction of differential metabolites and differential
  RNAs of the human follicular fluid from follicles of different sizes based on KEGG
  pathway map. The profiled metabolites are shown in the pathway network, and the
  significantly differential metabolites are presented as mean ± standard error of
  the mean (SEM). The gene colored red indicates increase in small follicles when
  compared with large follicles; the gene colored green indicates decrease in small
  follicles when compared with large follicles.

  as a predictor of follicular development.
