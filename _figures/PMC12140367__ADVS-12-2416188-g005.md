caption: The key steps of the S‐TeA biosynthetic pathway using uniformly 13C‐labeled
  threonine (13C4‐Thr) in A . alternata. A) The routes for biosynthesis of S‐TeA and
  its predicted labeling from 13C4‐Thr. B) Mass spectra of key metabolites synthesized
  from unlabeled threonine (−13C4‐Thr) in A. alternata. C) Mass spectra of key metabolites
  synthesized from 13C4‐Thr (+13C4‐Thr) in A. alternata. Unlabeled and newly synthesized
  compounds from 13C4‐Thr labeled represented by black and blue lines, respectively.
  The response of the most abundant peak in each graph was set to 100%. Thr, threonine;
