caption: MBD2 represses methylated genes in cis by recruiting chromatin repressor
  complexes. It can also induce gene expression through demethylation or recruitment
  of chromatin activation complexes. A new pathway for long-range repression mediated
  through activation and demethylation of microRNA is supported by the data presented
  in this paper.
