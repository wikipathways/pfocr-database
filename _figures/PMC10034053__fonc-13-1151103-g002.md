caption: Mechanism of action of immune cells in CP. (A) NF-κB signaling pathway in
  pancreatic macrophages. Upon phosphorylation of IκBs by kinases such as the IκB
  kinase complex in response to various stimuli, IκBs are targeted for degradation
  by the proteasome, after which the NF-κB subunit is released from the inhibitory
  complex; NF-κB subunits can then translocate to the nucleus to activate numerous
  NF-κB-specific target genes (B) STAT5 promotes chronic pancreatitis by enhancing
  GM-CSF-dependent neutrophil augmentation; (C) STING signaling protects against chronic
  pancreatitis by modulating Th17 response.
