caption: Methylotrophic metabolism in M. extorquens AM1. The result of expressing
  the glutathione (GSH) pathway from P. denitrificans is indicated with the dashed
  arrows. Those reactions that can occur spontaneously or that are catalyzed by two
  enzymes are indicated. Arrows pointing in both directions indicate reversible enzymatic
  reactions. The thin arrows leading from methylene-H4F and formyl-H4F to biomass
  represent biosynthetic reactions directly involving these two C1-H4F derivatives.
  Arrows to the right of H4MPT indicate biosynthesis reactions for this cofactor;
  only the two indicated gene products have been implicated in this process. MDH,
  methanol dehydrogenase; MaDH, methylamine dehydrogenase; MtdA, NADP-dependent methylene-H4F/methylene-H4MPT
  dehydrogenase; Fch, methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase; FtfL, formate-H4F ligase; FDHs,
  formate dehydrogenases; DmrA, putative dihydromethanopterin reductase; Orf4, putative
  β-RFAP synthase; Fae, formaldehyde-activating enzyme; MtdB, NAD(P)-dependent methylene-H4MPT
  dehydrogenase; Mch, methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase; Fhc, formyltransferase/hydrolase
  complex.
