caption: Cartoon showing the accumulation of cytoplasmatic lipid droplets (CDLs) and
  the onset of the inflammatory process induced by the consumption of an unbalanced
  diet. In a standard diet (SD) regimen, the fats are absorbed by enterocytes, processed,
  and sorted in chylomicrons upon the orchestrated action of leptin/PPAR-γ signaling.
  Conversely, the administration of a high-fat with sucrose diet (HFD w/Suc) induces
  an accumulation of CLDs in the small intestine of mice. Consequently, high levels
  of leptin lead to a downregulation of the anti-inflammatory molecule (PPAR-γ). Contextually,
  there was activation of the proinflammatory signaling driven by the PI3K/mTOR pathway
  and TNF-α, leading to mucosal inflammation.
