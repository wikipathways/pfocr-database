caption: 'Only differences with the t-test p<0.05 are shown. Network presents fatty
  acids metabolic pathway, including saturates and monounsaturates (SFA and MUFA)
  and omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids with oxylipins and endocannabinoids synthesis
  pathway. Oxylipin metabolizing enzymes are colored by their class: red–lipoxygenase
  (LOX) and autoxidation pathway; blue–cytochrome p450 (CYP) epoxygenase; green–cyclooxygenase
  (COX); yellow–N-acylphosphatidylethanolamide-phospholipase D. Node size represents
  the fold change (sPTB/FTB) and the color represents the BMI group where the change
  was observed: orange–increased only in obese; red–increased in obese and underweight;
  pink–increased only in underweight; blue–decreased in underweight. Fads–fatty acid
  desaturase; Elov–fatty acids elongase; sEH–soluble epoxide hydrolase; DH–dehydrogenase.
  Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were not measured in this assay and are
  indicated only to visualize parent fatty acids for measured oxylipins and endocannabinoids.
  Means of individual metabolites and corresponding p-values are provided in .'
