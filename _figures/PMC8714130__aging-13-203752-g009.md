caption: 'The effect of TBF on alleviating mammary fibrosis tendency and its underlying
  mechanism induced by HFD during pregnancy and lactation. HFD during pregnancy and
  lactation caused inflammation of mammary tissue, destroyed the blood-milk barrier,
  and induced fibrotic lesions tendency in mammary. TBF significantly alleviates the
  inflammatory response caused by HFD, repairs the blood-milk barrier, and relieves
  the tendency of mammary tissue fibrosis. Potential protective mechanism of TBF:
  TBF inhibited the activation of the AKT/NF-KB signaling pathway, effectively inhibiting
  the inflammatory response to the induction of fibrosis; TBF promoted the expression
  of tight junction proteins claudin-3, occluding, and ZO-1, and repairs blood-milk
  barrier to reduce the risk of mammary tissue being exposed; TBF inhibited the activation
  of TGF-β/Smad signal and inhibits the occurrence of fibrosis tendency.'
