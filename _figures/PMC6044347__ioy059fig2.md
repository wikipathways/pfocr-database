caption: The steroidogenic pathway. In Leydig cells, androgens are derived from cholesterol.
  Cholesterol is from de novo synthesis, lipoproteins, lipid droplets, or plasma membrane.
  Lipoproteins, LDL (through the LDL-receptor pathway), HDL (through the SR-BI pathway),
  and lipid droplets contain esterified cholesterol (yellow) that can be used in steroidogenesis
  after de-esterification (green). Cholesterol is imported into mitochondria through
  a large protein complex, the transduceosome, composed of mitochondrial and cytosolic
  proteins. Cholesterol reaches CYP11A1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane where
  it is metabolized to pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is converted by 3β-HSD located at
  the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequent metabolism to androgen and
  its metabolites is by Leydig cell species-specific expression of CYPs and HSD.
