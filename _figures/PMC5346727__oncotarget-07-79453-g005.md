caption: The dark green frames and lines represent stage III HCC. The purple frames
  and lines represent stage IV HCC. Blue node represents DNA methylation of gene.
  The green and red ovals represent transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs, respectively.
  The upward yellow arrowhead represents miRNA upregulation during stage IV HCC, compared
  to that in stage III. The downward blue arrowhead represents miRNA downregulation
  in stage IV compared to that in stage III. TRAF2, TNFRSF1A, FOS, HRAS, PDGFB, JUN,
  IKBKG, RAP1A, NFKB1, NFKB2, and DAXX are involved in the MAPK signaling pathway,
  while E2F4, GDF6, SMAD6, PPP2CB, and BMPR1B regulate the TGF-β pathway during stage
  III HCC. The transcription factors JUN, NFKB1, and E2F4 are activated by stress
  signals, including the MAPK signaling and TGF-β pathways, inducing cellular responses
  such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell survival, and metastasis.
  AKT1, TRAF2, IL1R1, PDGFB, MAP3K2, GNA12, IL1B, NFKB1, and CDC25B are involved in
  the MAPK signaling pathway, while AKT1, CNTFR, IL7R, IL3RA, STAT3, and IFNAR1 regulate
  the JAK-STAT signaling pathway during stage IV HCC. The transcription factors NFKB1
  and STAT3 are activated by a number of stress signals, including the MAPK signaling
  and JAK-STAT pathways, inducing cellular responses, including cell proliferation,
  apoptosis, cell cycle, cell survival, and metastasis. miRNA and DNA methylation
  dysregulation may contribute to the perturbation of the MAPK and TGF-β pathways,
  resulting in aberrant cellular responses and HCC progression from stage III to stage
  IV. Obviously, the perturbation of the MAPK pathway and the shift from the TGF-β
  to JAK-STAT pathways caused by epigenetic miRNA regulation and DNA methylation may
  be the major mechanism of HCC progression from stage III to stage IV. STAT3, ILB,
  and NFKB1 were selected as potential drug targets to prevent the progression of
  HCC from stage III to stage IV.
