caption: 'Schematic representation of the radiation-induced NF-κB signaling network.
  The activation of NF-κB is mediated by different stimuli: (A) the EGFR signaling
  pathway, especially through the activity of HER2; (B) the radiation-induced cytokines;
  and (C) DSBs generated by IR-induced ROS. The transcriptional program of NF-κB leads
  to several downstream events, which result in enhanced aggressiveness, increased
  survival and better fitness of cancer cells.'
