caption: Mutant ATX3 triggers neuronal death. (1) Expanded ATX3 inhibits the phosphatase
  activity of PNKP, leading to persistent accumulation of DNA damage and prolonged
  activation of p53 and PKC proapoptotic pathway, which are responsible for neuron
  loss in SCA3; (2) PolyQ-expanded ATX3 also obtains augmented deubiquitinase activity
  toward p53, resulting in enhanced stability and activity of p53 and consequent p53-mediated
  neuronal cell death.
