caption: Autophagy influence on tumor-associated antigen presentation 1. Genetic alterations
  that cause cell transformation can also generate tumor-associated antigens (TAA)
  for immune recognition. Tumor cell death is an antigen source for antigen-presenting
  cells, such as dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages. DC activation by DAMPs and
  antigen processing leads to an upregulation of costimulatory molecules and MHC on
  DC surface, the cardinal signals for T lymphocyte activation, and migration to adjacent
  lymphoid tissue. 2. Mature DCs present TAA through MHC-I and MHC-II to naïve CD8+
  T cells and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Antigen recognition results in T lymphocyte
  differentiation in effector cells (CTL e Th) and migration to the tumor site. 3.
  In the tumor microenvironment, upon TAA recognition through TCR interaction with
  MHC-I and MHC II, CTL and Th lymphocytes, respectively, trigger cytotoxic mechanisms,
  as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) mediated ones. Despite that, inhibitory molecules, such
  as PD-1 and CTLA-4 in T cells, and PD-L1 in TME can interfere in T cell activation
  and function. IFN-γ stimulation can result in PD-L1 expression in both APCs and
  tumor cells, inhibiting T cell function. CTLA-4 expressed by regulatory T lymphocytes
  (Treg), through binding to co-stimulatory molecules, CD80/86, induces tolerogenic
  phenotype on DCs, amplifying the regulatory mechanisms in the TME. Autophagy (A)
  can either help or disturb the antigen presentation and T cell activation pathway.
  Autophagic activity on DCs seems to increase MHC-I expression, thus enhancing antigen
  presentation. On the other hand, autophagy activation on tumor cells may promote
  a reduction in MHC-I and an increase in PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression, leading to tumor
  progression. Sources (, , , , , –).
