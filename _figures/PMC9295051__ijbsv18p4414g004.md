caption: 'Regulatory network of HMGA1 in the haematopoietic system and urinary system.
  Haematopoietic system: HMGA1 mediates the imbalance of interleukin expression, resulting
  in B cell lymphoma. The Notch 1 signalling pathway associated with leukaemia activates
  HMGA1 to regulate cell proliferation. Bladder cancer: HIF1A-AS2 upregulates HMGA1
  expression to inhibit apoptosis. MiR-26a targeting HMGA1 leads to cell cycle arrest.
  After HMAGA1 is inhibited by Let-7i and miR-15a-5p, the proliferation and migration
  of bladder cancer cells are also weakened. Renal cell carcinoma: HMGA1 promotes
  migration and metastasis by inducing anoikis and EMT.'
