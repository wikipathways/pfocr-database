caption: Functions of exercise in AD. Exercise improves energy metabolism by centering
  mitochondria to ameliorate AD pathological progression. (i) Exercise improves the
  metabolic profile in AD. The induced IGF and VEGF in the periphery pass through
  the BBB to promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis, respectively. The elevated miR-342-5p
  crosses the BBB to regulate the axon initial segment. The increased glucose uptake
  hyperactivates PI3K/AKT signaling to contribute to Tau pathology. Activated β-HB
  induces BDNF signaling by HDAC2 and HDAC3. BDNF signaling participates in neuroprotective
  functions, including activating α-secretase, inhibiting β-secretase, promoting neuron
  survival, and protecting cognition. (ii) Exercise improves mitochondrial remodeling
  in AD. Exercise induces mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC-1α/FUNDC5 to stimulate
  the BDNF pathway. Exercise also improves mitochondrial homeostasis by regulating
  mitochondrial function, autophagy, and, to some extent, mitophagy. Drp-1 levels
  enhanced by exercise protect against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and cognitive function.
  (iii) Exercise decreases inflammation in AD. Some proinflammatory mediators (COX-2
  and iNOS) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) are attenuated by exercise through
  the p38/MAPK-dependent NF-κB pathway to systemically decrease inflammation. COX-2,
  cytochrome c oxidase subunit II; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. Color images
  are available online.
