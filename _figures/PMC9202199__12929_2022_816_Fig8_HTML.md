caption: Signal transduction pathways induced by estrogen and heteronemin in ER-positive
  and -negative breast cancer cells. Estrogen binds to ER-α at the cell surface or
  integrin αvβ3 receptor in ER-positive or ER-negative breast cancer cells, respectively
  to activate signal transduction pathways such as ERK1/2 and STAT3. Those signals
  play vital roles in gene expression involved in cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.
  In addition. On the other hand, heteronemin suppresses ERK1/2 and STAT3 activation
  and inhibits the expression of proliferative genes. In addition, heteronemin activates
  the caspase signal pathway
