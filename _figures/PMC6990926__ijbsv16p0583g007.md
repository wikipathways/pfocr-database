caption: Proposed model of lipid metabolism regulation in HER-2 positive breast cancer.
  Aspirin and Compound C inhibit c-myc synergistically. Upon c-myc signaling inhibition,
  the SREBP1 and its target gene expression are downregulated sequentially, which
  leads to decreased lipid biosynthesis and cell growth.
papertitle: Compound C enhances the anticancer effect of aspirin in HER-2-positive
  breast cancer by regulating lipid metabolism in an AMPK-independent pathway.
