caption: Basal and stress-induced expressions of HRK1 are governed by the Hog1 MAPK.
  An unknown signaling component upstream of the Ssk2 MAPKKK, other than the Ssk1
  response regulator, may trigger the Hog1 MAPK module (Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1) in response
  to osmotic and oxidative stresses. Hrk1 is involved in intracellular glycerol synthesis
  upon fludioxonil treatment via the HOG pathway. However, Hrk1 appears to play several
  Hog1-independent roles. Independent of the HOG pathway modulating ergosterol biosynthesis,
  Hrk1 promotes susceptibility to polyene and azole drugs. Furthermore, Hrk1 is partly
  involved in promoting resistance to oxidative damaging agents, such as diamide,
  and melanin biosynthesis, which is in stark contrast to Hog1. In conclusion, Hrk1
  plays both Hog1-dependent and –independent roles in C. neoformans.
