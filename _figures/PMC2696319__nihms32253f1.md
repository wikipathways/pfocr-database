caption: Sites of mutation which can result in activation of the Raf>MEK>ERK pathway.
  Mutations have been detected in Flt-3, Ras, Kit, Fms, G-CSFR, and at lower frequencies
  Raf-1 and B-Raf in AML. The BCR-ABL chromosomal translocation is present in virtually
  all CMLs and some ALLs. These mutations and chromosomal translocations could all
  result in activation of the Raf>MEK>ERK cascade. A ? is indicated in the connection
  between Tpl-2 and MEK. This is to indicate that there are other MEK activators besides
  Raf which can result in MEK activation and may confer sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.
  Mutations at phosphatase genes could also result in activation of this pathway although
  they would be predicted to be either tumor suppressor or dominant negative type
  mutations.
