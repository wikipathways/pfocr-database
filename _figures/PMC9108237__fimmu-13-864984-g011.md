caption: Working model of this study. In the progression of aristolochic acid nephropathy,
  the expression of miR-382 in kidney macrophage increased significantly and then
  suppressed signal regulatory protein α (SIRP-α) by combining 3′UTR of SIRP-α. Then,
  downregulation of SIRP-α activated the signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) by promoting the phosphorylation of STAT3 at S727 and Y705. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 translocated into nucleic and acted as a transcription factor, which was responsible
  for M2-like macrophage activation. M2-like macrophage was involved in epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of renal tubular epithelial as well as pro-fibrotic
  effects in aristolochic acid-induced kidney fibrosis.
