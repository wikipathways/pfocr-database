caption: A proposed working model of the FER-mediated C/N response. 14-3-3 proteins
  are accumulated in excess when plants experience a high C/N ratio, which leads to
  growth arrest. For the ATL6-mediated C/N response, receptor-like protein kinase
  FER interacts with and phosphorylates ATL6, which provides binding sites for 14-3-3
  protein, and eventually targets it for degradation by the UPS. In addition to FER,
  ATL6 may be phosphorylated by other protein kinases in the C/N response. Moreover,
  we propose that RALF1 peptide may also be involved in the C/N response via the FER–ATL6-mediated
  signal pathway. Dashed lines with arrowheads represent possible suggested connections
  for which there is no direct experimental evidence yet. (This figure is available
  in color at JXB online.)
