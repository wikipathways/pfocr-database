caption: Changes in mitochondrial function and metabolic pathways in diabetes and
  heart failure alter metabolite driven PTM of proteins. The decreased mitochondrial
  oxidative capacity results in increased flux through nonmetabolic pathways such
  as glucose to the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and altered NAD+ and acetyl‐CoA
  levels. Together these changes alter protein O‐GlcNAcylation (G) via O‐GlcNAcase
  (OGA) and O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and acetylation (A) via lysine acetyl transferases
  (KATs) and lysine deacetylases (KDACs). The altered PTMs can acutely regulate function
  by modifying contractile and oxidative machinery or by modifying chromatin to change
  gene expression hours, years, and possibly decades later.
