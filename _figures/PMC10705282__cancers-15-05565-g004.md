caption: In PTC, glycolysis is crucial for tumor growth. The enzyme FTO regulates
  PTC growth by affecting the stability of the APOE gene [193,197]. Reduced FTO levels
  lead to increased APOE expression, which promotes glycolysis through the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3
  signaling pathway. Thus, FTO acts as a suppressor of PTC growth [193]
