caption: Glucose metabolism generates glycolytic intermediates that can supply subsidiary
  pathways including the hexosamine pathway, PPP, and one-carbon metabolism, all of
  which support cell growth. Mitochondrial TCA cycle intermediates such as oxaloacetate
  (OAA) and citrate are used to generate cytosolic aspartate and acetyl-CoA for nucleotide
  and lipid synthesis, respectively. Mitochondria also generate H2O2 and acetyl-CoA
  for redox signaling and acetylation, respectively. NADPH is used to drive anabolic
  reactions and to maintain antioxidant capacity. Cytosolic sources of NADPH include
  the oxidative PPP, IDH1, and enzymes from one-carbon metabolism including MTHFD1.
  Mitochondrial sources of NADPH include MTHFD2, MTHF2L, and IDH2. HK2, hexokinase
  2; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
