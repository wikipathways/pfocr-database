caption: The role of NAD+ in the macrophage metabolic switch. Inflammatory stimuli
  increase HIF1α expression which, together with NAMPT, promotes the regeneration
  of NAD+ from the nicotinamide salvage pathway. NAD+ is an essential rate limiting
  substrate for SIRT1 activity. In the presence of active SIRT1, inflammation and
  glycolytic metabolism is inhibited but mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation
  are promoted.
