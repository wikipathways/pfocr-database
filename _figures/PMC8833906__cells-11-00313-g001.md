caption: Activation of PXR stimulates cholesterol synthesis and induces Pcsk9 in the
  liver. The processes and molecules upregulated and downregulated by PXR activation
  have been indicated with blue and red coloring in the figure, respectively. PXR
  activation leads to nuclear accumulation of SREBP2, which consequently induces cholesterogenic
  genes, including the rate-limiting enzyme HMGCR, and thus induces cholesterol synthesis.
  Furthermore, PXR activation directly induces Sqle to increase the rate of squalene
  epoxidation. Induction of DHCR24 enzyme targets cholesterol synthesis flux to the
  Kandutsch–Russell pathway instead of the Bloch pathway. PXR activation appears to
  bypass the usual negative feedback mechanism controlling cholesterol synthesis,
  including inhibition of SREBP2–SCAP complex translocation from the ER to the Golgi
  apparatus by high cellular cholesterol levels and desmosterol, as well as the inhibitory
  effect of cholesterol on SQLE activity. Accumulation of plasma LDL-C level is potentiated
  by induction of the hepatic Pcsk9 gene and a consequent increase in circulating
  PCSK9 levels.
