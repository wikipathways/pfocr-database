caption: The roles of ubiquitylation and SUMOylation in the modulation of TGF-β, NF-κB,
  and Nrf2 in DN. (A) USP15 deubiquitylates TGF-βR and rescues it from SMURF2-mediated
  degradation, which induces the upregulation of TGF-β signaling and consequent exacerbation
  of fibrosis and DN. USP15 also binds to SMAD7, forming a complex with SMURF2 that
  negatively regulates TGF-β. SMAD6 recruits A20 to deubiquitylate TRAF6, consequently
  inducing the inactivation of TRAF6, which negatively regulates the non-canonical
  TGF-β pathway. The SUMOylation of SMURF2 upregulates the TGF-β signal. RNF11 is
  a positive regulator of TGF-β, positively correlated with fibrosis and the severity
  of DN. (B) Ubiquitylation-mediated phosphorylation of IκB allows the activation
  of the NF-κB complex, which exerts a pro-inflammatory effect during DN. SUMO-1 is
  directly conjugated to IκBα at residues K21 and K22, which prevents IκBα from SUMOylation-mediated
  IκBα degradation. Besides, RelA induces NF-κB repression, while SUMOylation-mediated
  p100 and NEMO promote NF-κB activation. (C) Keap1-mediated ubiquitylation of Nrf2
  via cullin 3 and the Keap1-independent function of Nrf2 via β-TrCP degrade Nrf2
  and weaken the antioxidative stress ability, which in turn exacerbates DN. RNF4
  mediates the polyubiquitylation of polySUMOylated Nrf2, leading to its subsequent
  degradation in PML NBs. However, RNF11 positively regulates nuclear Nrf2 levels
  during oxidative stress through the RNF11-mediated s-linked ubiquitylation of Nrf2,
  which results in the stabilization of Nrf2 within PML NBs. NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa
