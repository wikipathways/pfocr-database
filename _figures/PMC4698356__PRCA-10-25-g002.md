caption: Schematic representation of proteins highlighted for their contributions
  to molecular regulation in diabetes and heart failure. Regulation of glucose uptake
  by glucose transporters (GLUT1, GLUT4) can increase flux in the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP) leading to the generation of UDP‐GlcNAc that can be used for O‐GlcNAcylation
  of proteins by O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O‐GlcNAcase (OGA). This includes oxidative
  phosphorylation complex subunits (I, II, III, IV, and V) as well as proteins involved
  in calcium handling (STIM1 and SERCA2a). OGA and OGT have now been shown to reside
  in multiple subcellular organelles including the mitochondria with UDP‐GlcNAc import
  by the putative transporter PNC. In the nucleus O‐GlcNAcylation can occur on both
  histones (H3, etc.) and transcription factors (e.g. Sp1 and MEF2). Additionally,
  OGT can interact with TET proteins to regulate DNA methylation via hydroxymethylation
  (5‐hmCpG). Together this regulation interacts with acetylation fueled by acetyl‐CoA
  possibly from the citric acid cycle (CAC). Overall, O‐GlcNAcylation and acetylation
  of multiple proteins controls cellular function at both the metabolic and transcriptional
  levels.
