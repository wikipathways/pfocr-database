caption: Multiple pathway stimulation of ADAM activity, leading to sAPPα proliferation
  and notch stimulation. The contribution of white matter overgrowth to autistic symptoms
  could begin with aberrant signaling of the ERK/MAPK pathway. Multiple extracellular
  signal molecules have disrupted levels in autism. This includes IL1β, EGF, and TNFα,
  which are elevated; and TGFβ, which is depressed. In addition, the receptor for
  EGF (EGFR) is elevated in autism. External stressors, such as LPS and reactive oxidizing
  species (ROS) produced by oxidative stress, have been implicated in autism. Activity
  of specific environmental toxins may exist but is still controversial. Once the
  ERK/MAPK pathway has, by whatever means, been perturbed, this can stimulate the
  ADAM proteins. The ADAMs not only cleave APP at the anabolic cleavage site, producing
  sAPPα, but are also necessary for EGFR signaling and stimulate NOTCH enzyme activity.
