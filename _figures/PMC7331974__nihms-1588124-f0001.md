caption: 'Top panel: Conventional, genome-originated mRNA molecule. Bottom panel:
  Projected stages of antisense RNA-mediated mRNA amplification. Boxed line – sense
  strand RNA. Single line – antisense strand RNA. “AUG” – functional translation initiation
  codon (could be other than “AUG”). “TCE”– 3’-terminal complementary element; “ICE”–
  internal complementary element, both on the antisense RNA strand. Yellow circle
  – helicase/modifying activity complex. Blue lines (both single and boxed) – RNA
  strand modified and separated from its complement by a helicase complex. Red arrowhead
  – position of cleavage of the chimeric intermediate. Step 1: Synthesis of antisense
  strand; step 2: Strand separation; step 3: Folding of antisense strand into self-priming
  configuration; step 4: Extension of self-primed antisense RNA; step 5: Strand separation;
  step 6: Cleavage of the chimeric intermediate; step 7: End-products of amplification.
  Note that chimeric RNA end product retains the intact coding capacity of conventional
  mRNA.'
