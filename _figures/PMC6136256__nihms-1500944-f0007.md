caption: After phagocytosis by macrophages, Mtb permeabilizes the phagosomal membrane,
  enabling TNT to translocate to the cytosol. The enzymatic activity of TNT hydrolyzes
  cellular NAD+ to nicotinamide (NAM) and ADP-ribose (ADPr). Depletion of the cytosolic
  NAD+ pool induces three major molecular events. RIPK63 senses lower NAD+ levels
  and/or increased levels of its degradation products and phosphorylates MLKL (pathway
  1), which then forms oligomeric pores in host cell membranes and induces necrotic
  death (). RIPK3 also migrates, together with Bcl-XL, to mitochondria (pathway 2),
  prevents caspase-8 activation, and induces formation of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition (MPT) pore, depolarizing mitochondria (). The third pathway is a consequence
  of the connection of the cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD+ pools, as shown previously
  (). Depleting cytosolic NAD+ also strongly reduces NAD+ levels in mitochondria,
  compromising the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthesis. Dashed lines
  indicate unknown molecular mechanisms.
