caption: Alcohol, ER stress, and the IRE1 pathway of the UPR. This figure illustrates
  the results of our experiments in alcohol fed animals showing ER stress from ethanol
  and its metabolites, acetaldehyde, and fatty acid ethanol ester (FAEE), by inducing
  an oxidative state in the ER mediating misfolding and unfolding of proteins and
  oxidation of lipids. The ER stress leads to upregulation of the IRE1 pathway leading
  to splicing of XBP1 mRNA resulting in the translation of the transcription factor
  XBP1-S which is transported to the nucleus where it upregulates the expression of
  chaperones, oxido-reductases/foldases such as PDI, ERAD proteins, and lipid synthetic
  enzymes through DNA binding elements, ER stress element (ERSE) and the UPR element
  (UPRE). The activation of this pathway leads to adaptation of the pancreas to the
  stress of ethanol abuse and prevents pancreatic injury and disease.
