caption: (A) B. subtilis has an essential role against COVID-19-associated inflammation.
  (A) Shows that the BS produced by B. subtilis due to its anti-inflammatory property
  can be a perfect candidate against COVID-19. When the virus enters the host cell,
  with the help of TMPRSS2 by cleaving the S protein to S! and 2 subunits, it will
  bind to ACE2 receptor. Consequently, the replication of virus initiated to NF-κB
  pathway will stimulate the cytokine storm release. At this phase, offering COVID-19
  patients surfactin in addition to other medications promises to inhibit the NF-κB
  production by affecting the TH1 and HO-1 macrophages, which will decrease the cytokine
  storm impacts and COVID-19-associated inflammation. (B) Antiviral mechanism of BS
  against SARS-CoV-2 virus; BS shall work on the structure of the virus such as lipid
  envelope and spike protein, and also can rapture the outer membrane and inactivate
  the virus by targetting the genetic material. Disruption of viral structure will
  result in the formation of micelle and engulfment of vital parts and turn it into
  an inactive form.
