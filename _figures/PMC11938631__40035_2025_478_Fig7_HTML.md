caption: Upregulation of MMP-9 by mTOR signaling and proteolytic disruption of BBB.
  Following TBI and in AD, mTOR signaling pathway is activated, leading to upregulation
  of MMP-9, which disrupts the basement membrane (BM) and junction proteins. Neutrophils
  are a major source of MMP-9. MMP-9 can also be produced from BECs, astrocytes, and
  pericytes. Created with BioRender.com
