caption: Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and confirmed target genes of
  miR-106a. The extrinsic pathway is mediated by death ligands and death receptors,
  including FASL and FAS. Activation of death receptors initiates a series of reactions
  with final stimulation of caspases 3, 6, and 7, resulting in apoptosis. miR-106a
  can hinder apoptosis by suppressing multiple members of this pathway, including
  FAS, PTEN, and caspase-8, -3, and -7. The intrinsic pathway incorporates mitochondria
  in promoting apoptosis. Activating this pathway in response to different stresses,
  such as oncogenic activity, stimulates mitochondrial membrane proteins to release
  cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. Recruiting Apaf-1 and cytochrome C, procaspase-9
  forms the apoptosome complex and converts to active caspase-9. By activating other
  apoptotic caspases, the cell consequently heads to apoptosis. miR-106a overexpression
  inhibits this pathway via targeting Bim, Mcl-1, and caspase-9 in different cancers.
