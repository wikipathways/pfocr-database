caption: A simplified scheme of the glycolytic pathway, emphasizing the generation
  of NADH and the purpose of LDH in consuming excess NADH. In the cytosol NADH is
  formed in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) reaction. GAPDH is
  strongly inhibited if NADH accumulates. GAPDH catalyzes the oxidation and phosphorylation
  of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by inorganic phosphate (Pi), producing 1,3-bis-P-glycerate.
  In the subsequent enzymatic step the phosphate group is donated to ADP to produce
  ATP. After another three enzymatic steps, pyruvate is formed. The conversion of
  pyruvate to lactate, catalyzed by LDH, consumes NADH and relieves GAPDH of its inhibition
  by NADH, allowing the cycle to continue. α-Ketobutyrate (in blue), which was used
  by Sada et al., may substitute for pyruvate in the LDH reaction. Oxaloacetate (purple)
  may also consume cytosolic NADH in the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase reaction (MDHc),
  in which oxaloacetate is converted to malate at the expense of NADH.If this system
  is flooded with lactate (e.g. by lactate exported from astrocytes to nerve cells),
  then NADH would accumulate. If the system is flooded by pyruvate (e.g. by experimental
  injection of pyruvate into nerve cells), then NADH levels would be reduced.
