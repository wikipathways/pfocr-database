caption: 'Physiological events post-BCG exposure: UC cell exposure to BCG results
  in α5β1 receptor mediated BCG internalization involving α5β1cross linking. Following
  internalization, BCG generates oxidative stress which activates signaling pathway
  including NF-κB, NRF2, gene transcription, and phenotypic changes. NF-κB signaling
  pathway activates iNOS which generates NO contributing to further oxidative stress.
  α5β1cross linking also activates NF-κB signaling pathway. NF-κB also activates expression
  of various cytokines and chemokines to elicit a host cellular immune response.'
