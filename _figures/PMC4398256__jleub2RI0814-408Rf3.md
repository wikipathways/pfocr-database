caption: In Tregs, mTOR activity is modulated by many upstream inputs from surface
  receptors (including TCR, CD28, IL-2R, leptin receptor, and S1PR1). Loss of mTORC1
  function in Tregs leads to a dramatic reduction in lipid biosynthesis via the mevalonate
  pathway, which is required for Treg-suppressive activity. mTOR can also regulate
  Treg biology by controlling glycolysis and HIF-1α function. A summary of such regulation
  is described in this figure, with blue arrows indicating positive regulation and
  blue, flat-ended lines depicting negative regulation.
