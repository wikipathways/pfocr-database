caption: List of genes involved in the complement and coagulation cascades pathway
  generated by KEGG of the differently expressed genes between C. irritans-infected
  and non-infected S. marmoratus, 72 h (group D) and 96 h (group E) post-challenge
  and uninfected fish were sampled as control (group A). c group D vs group A; d group
  E vs group A. Red indicates significantly increased expression; green indicates
  significantly decreased expression; and pink indicates unchanged expression. Blue
  denotes genes that were not identified in the expression profile analysis

  of Sebastiscus marmoratus in response to infection with the parasitic ciliate Cryptocaryon
  irritans.
