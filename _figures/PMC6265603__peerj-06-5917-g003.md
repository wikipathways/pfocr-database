caption: A standard place is illustrated as a circle representing proteins involved
  in the pathway. A continuous transition is depicted as a sqaure representing cellular
  processes including phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. A directed arc connects
  a place with a transition and vice versa. Blue places represent important proteins
  of PI3K pathway selected for this study in particular. (A) PN model of normal PI3K/Akt
  pathway. Blue places represent important proteins of PI3K/Akt pathway selected for
  this study in particular. Other colored places include (Red = OGT and Orange = OGA).
  (B) PN model of altered PI3K/Akt pathway. Blue places represent important proteins
  of PI3K pathway selected for this study in particular. Red arcs represent the changes
  in PN model as compared to normal signaling pathway, that is, increased deactivation
  of IRS-1 and Akt.
