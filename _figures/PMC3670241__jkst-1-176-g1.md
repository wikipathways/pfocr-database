caption: Figure 1. The Drosophila JAK-STAT pathway. The Drosophila JAK-STAT pathway
  consists of three Unpaired (Upd) ligands here collectively referred to as Upd (orange).
  The receptor Domeless (Dome) (magenta) is activated when Upd binds. This results
  in activation of the JAK Hopscotch (Hop) (green), leading to tyrosine phosphorylation
  (brown circles) of Dome. The phosphorylated receptor serves as a docking site for
  a STAT92E dimer (blue). Once bound, STAT92E is phosphorylated on tyrosine 711, generating
  an active STAT92E dimer that translocates to the nucleus, binds to a consensus TTCNNNGAA
  site, and alters gene expression. Some of the best-characterized STAT92E target
  genes are SOCS36E, zfh1, chinmo. SOCS36E (pink) encodes a negative regulator of
  Dome/JAK activity. A second receptor Eye Transformer (Et) [also called Latran (Lat)]
  referred to as Et/Lat (red) forms heterodimers with Dome and inhibits JAK-STAT signaling.
