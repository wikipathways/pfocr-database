caption: The signaling pathway regulating RAB26-induced SRC degradation (a) Under
  normal physiological conditions, RAB26 interacts with ATG16L1, resulting in the
  induction of autophagy, which targets phosphorylated SRC for degradation. Basal
  levels of CDH5 are expressed in HPMECs to retain the endothelial barrier. (b) Under
  endotoxin stimulation, the inhibition of RAB26 activity results in autophagy inhibition,
  and phosphorylated SRC accumulates in the cytoplasm. The interaction between phosphorylated
  SRC and CDH5 phosphorylated at p-Tyr685 and p-Tyr731 promotes CDH5 internalization,
  thus reducing AJ formation and endothelial barrier integrity.

  description: The signaling pathway regulating RAB26-induced SRC degradation (a)
    Under normal physiological conditions, RAB26 interacts with ATG16L1, resulting
    in the induction of autophagy, which targets phosphorylated SRC for degradation.
    Basal levels of CDH5 are expressed in HPMECs to retain the endothelial barrier.
    (b) Under endotoxin stimulation, the inhibition of RAB26 activity results in autophagy
    inhibition, and phosphorylated SRC accumulates in the cytoplasm. The interaction
    between phosphorylated SRC and CDH5 phosphorylated at p-Tyr685 and p-Tyr731 promotes
    CDH5 internalization, thus reducing AJ formation and endothelial barrier integrity.
