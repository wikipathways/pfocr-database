caption: Simplified diagram of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical (CBGTC) loop.
  Striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing dopamine (DA) D1 receptors
  receive glutamatergic (Glu) inputs (+) from cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs) and
  project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) as well as the internal segment
  of the globus pallidus (GPi). This is called the direct pathway and promotes movement.
  MSNs expressing DA D2 receptors also receive inputs from CPNs and project to the
  external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). The GPe, in turn, projects to the
  subthalamic nucleus (STN) and this to the SNr/GPi. This is known as the indirect
  pathway and counteracts movement. GABA (−) outputs from SNr/GPi project to the thalamus
  (Thal), which in turn, sends Glu inputs (+) back to the cortex thus completing the
  CBGTC loop. Both D1 and D2 MSNs also receive afferents from the substantia nigra
  pars compacta (SNc) and Thal. A hyperdirect pathway connects the CPNs of the cortex
  directly to the STN. In addition, a newly described pathway from CPNs to SNr GABAergic
  neurons is illustrated. Several classes of interneurons, including acetylcholine
  (ACh) interneurons, exert control over the MSNs. For the sake of simplicity, GABAergic
  interneurons and some additional synaptic pathways are not illustrated.
