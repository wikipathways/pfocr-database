caption: The “cross-talk” between liver and peripheral organs in the pathogenesis
  of NAFLD. The impairment of the hypothalamic signaling pathway due to mutations
  (Leptin receptor and MC4R) by affecting the appetite or inflammation leads to the
  development of obesity and NAFLD. Dysfunction of adipose tissue in obesity, lipodystrophy
  or insulin resistance provides a source of excess fat and release of adipokines
  such as Leptin, Adiponectin, Resistin, and proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α
  and IL-6 that participated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. In addition, emerging evidence
  suggests that an altered gut permeability consequently affect circulating levels
  of molecular such as LPS, FFA, bile acid, and to the release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines by the regulation of TLR and FXR further influence the development and
  progression of NAFLD, recognized as effect of gut–liver axis. In the liver, the
  dysregulation of lipid de novo lipogenesis and imbalance of lipid influx and efflux
  causes lipotoxicity and may result in mitochondrial dysfunction, overproduction
  of ROS and ER stress as well as the consequent activation of inflammatory responses,
  thus influencing the risk of progression of NAFLD to NASH, as observed in obesity
  and insulin resistance
