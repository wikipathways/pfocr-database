caption: '(A) Summary of pathway analysis offers a metabolomics view, which displays
  all matched pathways as circles. The color and size of each circle is based on the
  p value and pathway impact value, respectively. Please refer to  for numerical details;
  (B) Representation of the steroid biosynthetic pathway. In red, the metabolites
  that increased in broccoli sprouts grown under conditions of continuous light, compared
  with the metabolites in sprouts grown under conditions of continuous dark. In blue,
  the KEGGS numbers are reported for each metabolite in the same pathway that do not
  appear to be altered; (C) Summary of the major metabolic pathways altered in broccoli
  sprouts grown under conditions of continuous light, compared with the metabolites
  in sprouts grown under conditions of continuous dark. False Discovery Rate (FDR*)
  and p-value * from MPINet []; p-value # and Q-value # from IMPaLA []; impact scores
  for the topological analysis using relative betweeness centrality from MetPA [].'
