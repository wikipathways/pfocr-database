caption: Simplified Model of the Discussed Mechanical Signaling Networks in Self-Organizing
  Pollen Tube Growth.For better-elucidated signaling modules, feedback regulations
  and pathway crosstalks are common. Their regulations of structural networks are
  partially revealed, whilst still needing further characterization. The role of emerging
  new pathways, such as hormone and small peptide signaling, remains elusive. For
  details, see the text.
