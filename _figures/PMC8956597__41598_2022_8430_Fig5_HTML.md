caption: Individual comparison of phosphorylation status between pre- and post-treatment
  HER2-positive gastric cancer. Proteins in the ErbB signaling pathway are selected
  from the KEGG database. Proteins with quantified phosphosites are shown as white
  boxes with solid lines. Proteins without quantified phosphosites are shown as grey
  boxes with dotted lines. Differentially expressed phosphosites (log2 |FC| > 1) are
  depicted by a purple line. Phosphosites with no quantitative value are filled with
  grey.
