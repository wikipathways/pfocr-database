caption: A decrease in perfusion pressure activates the renal baroreceptor, stimulating
  renin synthesis and release. A decrease in sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration
  at the macula densa stimulates renin synthesis and release. Activation of β-adrenergic
  receptors (β-ARs) present in juxtaglomerular cells induces renin synthesis and release
  via the cAMP pathway (inset). Generation of cAMP leads to activation of protein
  kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein),
  a transcription factor that binds CRE (cAMP-responsive element) and activates renin
  transcription. Angiotensin II inhibits renin synthesis and release (through a negative
  feedback loop) via activation of the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1R; also
  known as AGTR1) and by increasing blood pressure. AC, adenyl cyclase; CBP, CREB-binding
  protein; Gsα, stimulatory G protein subunit α.
