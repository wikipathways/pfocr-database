caption: Mechanism of PM-induced airway epithelial injury (schematic). PM enters the
  airway by respiratory movement of the human body and deposits on the airway epithelial
  cells. PM activates the PI3K/AKT pathway in the airway epithelium and upregulates
  the expression of inflammatory factors such as COX-2, PGE2, IL-6, and IL-8, resulting
  in airway epithelial inflammation. Subsequently, airway epithelial inflammation
  causes a downregulation of Filaggrin expression via the COX-2/PGE2pathway
papertitle: Evidence for the critical role of the PI3K signaling pathway in particulate
  matter-induced dysregulation of the inflammatory mediators COX-2/PGE2 and the associated
  epithelial barrier protein Filaggrin in the bronchial epithelium.
