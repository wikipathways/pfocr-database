caption: Sex differences in the signal transduction pathways of eNOS activation in
  endothelial cells by testosterone and the subsequent vascular response. Testosterone
  is generally thought to increase nitric oxide (NO) availability through genomic
  and non-genomic pathways in men. Testosterone works through a separate pathway in
  women resulting in reduced NO availability and impaired vasodilation. Androgen receptor
  (AR), endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK),
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt (protein kinase B), G protein-coupled
  estrogen receptor 1 (GPR30 agonist, G-1). From Stanewicz et al. [], with permission
