caption: 'Fig. 7. Respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport pathways in R.sphaeroides
  and model for redox sensing and signal transduction. The solid and dotted arrows
  demonstrate the electron and signal flows, respectively. The red arrows indicate
  the photosynthetic cyclic electron transport pathway. The thickness of the arrow
  indicates the presumptive relative contribution of cytochromes c2 and cy to channel
  electrons from the bc1 complex to the cbb3 oxidase. The ‘+’ sign indicates the activation
  of genes. Abbreviations: Q-pool, ubiquinone pool; bc1, cytochrome bc1 complex; C2,
  soluble cytochrome c2; Cy, membrane-bound cytochrome cy; aa3, aa3-type cytochrome
  c oxidase; RC, photochemical reaction center; Qox and Qxt, two quinol oxidases;
  PS, photosynthesis; fix, fixation; hv, light; red, reduced form.'
