caption: MAPK signalling pathway. The activation of the MAPK signalling pathway begins
  with the conversion of GDP to GTP, which activates Ras. Activated Ras then recognises,
  binds to, and activates Raf. Subsequently, hydrolysis of GTP leads to the separation
  of active Raf from Ras. The active Raf, known as MAPKKK, further activates MAPKK.
  Finally, MAPKK activates MAPK. The active MAPK molecule translocates to the nucleus
  and triggers the activation of various transcription factors.
