caption: 'Feedback in the lactose-uptake pathway. Three genes under common regulatory
  control constitute the lactose-uptake pathway: lacZ encodes the enzyme to break
  down lactose, lacY encodes a permease (importer of lactose, shown in green), which
  actively imports lactose from the environment (here: the non-metabolizable lactose-analogue
  TMG, blue wedge) and lacA encodes a transacetylase. Bistability is achieved by a
  positive feedback-loop; the imported TMG acts as an inducer of the lac-genes by
  increasing the unbinding rate of LacI tetramer proteins (red) from the so-called
  operator binding sites in the lac-regulatory region. LacI tetramers inhibit the
  expression of the lac-genes. As a result, the induced state shown on the right,
  with the lac-genes expressed, is stable if the permease imports enough inducers
  to deactivate the repressors. The uninduced state shown on the left can also be
  stable, since in the absence of lac-expression, the repressors prevent expression
  of the lac-genes by binding to the regulatory region and forming a DNA loop. However,
  this regulatory circuit is built from stochastic components and can be interrupted
  by random fluctuations of the number of mRNA, proteins, inducer, repressors or the
  binding state of repressors to DNA. These fluctuations lead to transitions between
  the induced and uninduced states.'
