caption: 'Epigenetic mechanisms in detail. A, Cycle of methylation and demethylation
  by DMNT and TET proteins, respectively. TET‐mediated demethylation generates intermediate
  5hmC, 5fC and 5caC marks that are converted to unmodified cytosine by the BER pathway.
  B, Bivalent histone marks; the presence of both activating H3K4me3, and repressing
  H3K27me3 marks at certain loci allow for rapid gene activation and are characteristic
  of stem cells. C, Nucleosome remodelling complexes can affect gene expression at
  relevant loci: TrxG complexes allow expression of self‐renewal factors whereas PcG
  complexes prevent transcription of tumour suppressors. D, Long noncoding RNAs modify
  gene expression by affecting the recruitment of transcriptional regulators. E, MicroRNAs
  modify gene expression by directly affecting transcription [Color figure can be
