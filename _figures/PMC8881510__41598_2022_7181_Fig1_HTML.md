caption: Proposed model for JA perception via COI1-JAZ co-receptor complex (A) and
  crosstalk between phytohormones in the defense signaling pathway (B) (adapted from
  Wasternack and Hause; Pieterse et al.). (A) During stress and wounding JAZ are recruited
  by the SCFCOI1 and MYC2 are released thus activating JA-defense genes (positive
  feedback loop). The newly synthesized JAZ genes during defense response binds to
  the MYC2 thus repressing the JA-defense genes (negative feedback loop). (B) Herbivorous
  insects induce JA- and ABA-dependent signaling pathways while necrotrophic pathogens
  induce JA- and ET-dependent signaling pathways. Solid lines are established interactions,
  dashed lines are hypothesized interactions, arrows indicate positive effects, and
  red inhibition lines represent negative effects. JA, Jasmonic acid; JAZ, JASMONATE
  ZIM DOMAIN; SCFCOI1, SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase; MYC2, bHLHzip transcription factor
  MYC2; ERF1, Ethylene Response Factor 1; ORA59, octadecanoid-responsive Arabidopsis
  AP2/ERF-domain protein 59; VSP2, VEGETATIVE STORAGE PROTEIN2; PDF1.2, PLANT DEFENSIN1.2.
