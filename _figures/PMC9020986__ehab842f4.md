caption: New insights into immune cell functions and phenotypes in ischaemic cardiac
  injury. (1) Cardiac macrophages in the healthy heart are mostly CCR2– and of foetal
  origin, as opposed to monocyte-derived CCR2 expressing macrophages, which infiltrate
  the heart after MI. Ischaemic injury reduces CCR2– TIMD4+ and TIMD4– resident macrophage
  abundance, whereas CCR2+ monocyte-derived macrophages expand and adopt heterogeneous
  phenotypes within infarcted tissue. (2) The cGAS-STING signalling pathway is activated
  in CCR2+ macrophages by extracellular DNA released from dying cells, thereby promoting
  an IRF3-dependent type I IFN release and monocyte recruitment. (3) Engulfment of
  dying cells by macrophages within the infarcted myocardium results in elevated macrophage
  fatty acid content, which stimulates mitochondrial respiration. This metabolic signalling
  pathway promotes an anti-inflammatory macrophage response during wound healing after
  MI. (4) The different post-MI healing stages are also accompanied by diverse neutrophil
  subsets, with an aged neutrophil phenotype accumulating in the circulation over
  time. Conversely, heart infiltrating neutrophils acquire a high expression level
  of the surface lectin SiglecF, resembling an activated phenotype previously observed
  in cancer. (5) Basophil-derived IL4 and IL14 production plays an essential role
  in the infarcted heart, by balancing the ratio of proinflammatory monocytes to reparative
  Ly6Clo macrophages. (6) A new macrophage phenotype expressing GATA6 has been identified
  in the pericardial cavity fluid, which is recruited to the heart in response to
  MI and plays a protective role by preventing excessive cardiac fibrosis. (7) The
  pericardial adipose tissue contains lymphoid clusters [fat-associated lymphoid clusters
  (FALCs)], which expand after MI. Activated dendritic cells migrate from the infarcted
  myocardium to pericardial adipose tissue FALCs and induce B and T cell proliferation.
  (8) Moreover, an increasing number of patrolling Ly6Clo monocytes, which express
  PDL1, interacts with T cells within pericardial FALCs and induces their apoptosis,
  possibly as an inhibitory mechanism to prevent sustained lymphocyte activation.
  (9) IL2 promotes ILC2 expansion in the circulation and the pericardial adipose tissue
  after MI, and is associated with an improved cardiac function, while genetic depletion
  of ILC2s worsened cardiac recovery post-MI. (10) An innate-like B cell subset within
  pericardial FALCs expresses high amounts of GM-CSF in response to MI, which induces
  IL23 and IL17 cytokine release by other pericardial immune cells. (11) The systemic
  cytokine increase triggers the production of the granulocytic factor G-CSF, which,
  in turn promotes de novo production of neutrophils in the bone marrow, thereby maintaining
  the neutrophil supply to the ischaemic heart.
