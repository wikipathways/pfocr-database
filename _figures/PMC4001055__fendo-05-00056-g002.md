caption: Spermatogenesis ROS endocrine gene transcriptional regulation. FSH acts through
  its receptors in Sertoli cells (FSHR) to regulate the spermatogenesis and LH stimulates
  androgen production by Leydig cells after binding to LHR. However, steroid hormones,
  i.e., androgen and estrogen, and other agents that bind or prevent binding to steroid
  hormone receptors, which are present in Sertoli cells, germ cells, and Leydig cells
  also regulate testicular function as several growth factors, e.g., insulin like
  growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), acting via their receptors
  possibly modulate AR and ERalpha and beta-mediated pathways. The pathway, mediated
  by adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), appears to be the primary intracellular signaling
  pathway in all testicular cells and stimulates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase
  (PKA). Thus, testicular function is disrupted by interactions between ROS and lipids,
  proteins, DNA, and several signaling pathways, some acting locally, e.g., AR and
  ER-mediated pathways, and others indirectly by modulating hypothalamus–pituitary
  function. Hormonal activation of transcriptional gene activity results in changes
  in cell differentiation and function. PMC, peritubular myoid cell; CRE, cAMP responsive
  elements; ARE, androgen-responsive elements; ERE, estrogen-responsive elements [modified
  from Ref. ()].
