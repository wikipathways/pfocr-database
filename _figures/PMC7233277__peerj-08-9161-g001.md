caption: (A) Construction of sample-specific networks based on gene expression data.
  A reference network can be established based on the expression profiles of n reference
  samples by calculating the correlation coefficients PCCn of gene pairs. Then, adding
  a new cancer sample sdx into the reference samples, a perturbed network is established
  by calculating the new correlation PCCn + 1 of the n + 1 samples. Because of sample
  sdx, the perturbed network is different from the reference network, and the difference
  ∆PCCn (PCCn + 1 − PCCn) of each edge in the background network constitutes the differential
  network. Then, the significance of each edge can be quantified by a statistical
  Z-test. The sample-specific network for sample sdx is composed by those edges with
  significant ∆PCCn. (B) The framework to identify the breast cancer-related gene–gene
  interaction network based on gene expression. Using the sample-specific network
  analysis method, m cancer sample-specific networks were constructed. Then, these
  constructed sample-specific networks were analyzed to identify breast cancer-related
  networks, stage-related networks and subtype-related networks, as well as gene-interaction
  biomarkers associated with the prognosis of breast cancer. Moreover, pathway enrichment
  analysis based on KEGG pathways and survival analysis based on the LASSO regression
  model were performed.
