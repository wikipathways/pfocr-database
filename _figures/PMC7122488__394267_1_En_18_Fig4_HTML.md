caption: 'The oxidative stress-induced Keap1 ↔ Nrf2 pathway. Under non-oxidative homeostatic
  conditions, the sensor Keap1is bound to the Nrf2 molecule resulting in its polyubiquitination
  and subsequent degradation via the proteasomal pathway. Oxidative stress modifies
  the ROS-sensing cysteine residues of Keap1 leading to loss of its polyubiquitination
  and degradation activity, dissociation of Nrf2 that becomes stabilized and accumulates.
  Then, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and forms a heterodimer with the sMAF transcription
  factor. The Nrf2/sMAF heterodimer binds to ARE and induces transcription of numerous
  cytoprotective antioxidant and detoxification genes. ARE antioxidant response element,
  Keap1 Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived protein with CNC homology (ECH)-associated
  protein 1, Nrf2 nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45- related factors 2, sMAF small musculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma, Ub-Ub-Ub poly-ubiquitin chain. Sources: Refs. [–, , ]'
