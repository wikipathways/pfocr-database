caption: The cell cycle pathway showed the most significant upregulation while the
  cardiac muscle contraction pathway showed the most significant downregulation in
  EXO1_high breast cancer patients. (A) The pathway mapping plot of cell cycle pathway.
  The red color indicated up-regulated genes and light green color indicated subpathways
  of cell cycle pathway; (B) The pathway mapping plot of cardiac muscle contraction
  pathway. The dark green color indicated down-regulated genes and light green color
  indicated subpathways of cardiac muscle contraction pathway.

  poor prognosis.
