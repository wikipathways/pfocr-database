caption: Schematic representation of the nuclear pore complex and the nuclear import
  and export cycles.A, the nuclear pore complex is embedded into the nuclear envelope
  and composed of nucleoporins (Nups) that are structurally arranged into the inner
  ring, cytoplasmic and nuclear rings, cytoplasmic filaments, and nuclear basket.
  Within the lumen of the nuclear envelope, a circular scaffold known as the luminal
  ring surrounds the nuclear pore complex. The central channel of the pore is lined
  with Nups that contain phenylalanine–glycine repeats (FG-Nups). B, the movement
  of macromolecules and complexes across the nuclear envelope is facilitated by nuclear
  transport receptors. In the canonical nuclear import pathway, a cargo is recognized
  by nuclear import receptors importin-α (imp-α) and importin-β (imp-β) and is ferried
  across the pore. Once in the nucleus, the binding of Ran-GTP to importin-β causes
  the disassembly of the import complex and releases the cargo. Importin-β bound to
  Ran-GTP is transported back to the cytoplasm, whereas importin-α is recycled by
  CAS protein (also known as exportin2). GTP hydrolysis of Ran releases importin-β
  for the next round of import. For nuclear export, a cargo with nuclear export signal
  is usually bound by CRM1 (also known as exportin1). After the export complex enters
  the cytoplasm, Ran-GTP is hydrolyzed to Ran-GDP, and this promotes dissociation
  of the complex. The export of mRNAs is different from that of proteins because mRNAs
  are bound by many proteins in the form of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes.
  mRNA export requires the nuclear transport receptor NXF1/NXT1 (also known as TAP/p15).
  Following the completion of export, the mRNP undergoes remodeling events where the
  transport receptors and many bound proteins are removed, whereas other protein factors
  such as ribosomes join. CAS, cellular apoptosis susceptibility; CRM1, chromosomal
  maintenance 1; imp-α, importin-α; imp-β, importin-β; mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein;
  NXF1, nuclear RNA export factor 1; NXT1, nuclear transport factor 2-like export
  factor 1.
