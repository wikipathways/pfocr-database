caption: Signal integration following BCR engagement. Schematic of distal signaling
  events following BCR engagement. (a) Phospho-BLNK serves as a scaffold for Grb2,
  and this acts to prime activation of Sos. Active PKCβ phosphorylates RasGRP3 to
  facilitate its activation by DAG. The guanine exchange factor function of RasGRP3
  converts GDP-Ras to GTP-Ras, which then acts to augment the guanine exchange factor
  function of Sos. Together RasGRP3 and Sos produce sufficient GTP-Ras to power activation
  of the MAPK cascade illustrated here by Raf, MEK, and ERK. (b) Active PKCβ acts
  to phosphorylate CARMA1 to induce assembly of the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex. This
  allows activation of TAK1 which facilitates activation of the NFκB pathway by phosphorylating
  IKK and of the JNK pathway by phosphorylating MKK4 and MKK7. Active PKCβ also acts
  in a feedback inhibition loop by phosphorylating Btk on serine 180. This catalyzes
  the removal of Btk from the plasma membrane away from its substrate, PLCγ2.
