caption: Overview of ovarian cancer cell metabolism. (A) Interaction of different
  metabolic pathways within ovarian cancer cells. There are connections between different
  metabolisms through metabolites. (B) The heterogeneity of ovarian cancer metabolism
  is characterized by abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. During the development
  of ovarian cancer, different metabolic phenotypes are gradually acquired, such as
  enhanced OXPHOS, PPP and FAO. ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; FAO, Fatty acid oxidation;
  OXPHOS, Oxidative phosphorylation; PPP, Pentose phosphate pathway; TCA, Tricarboxylic
  acid.
