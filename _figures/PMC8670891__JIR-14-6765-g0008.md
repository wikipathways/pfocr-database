caption: Schematic diagram for the mechanism of dexmedetomidine regulating vascular
  leakage by inhibiting ferroptosis via modulating metabolic reprogramming and inhibiting
  mitochondria fission. Dexmedetomidine enhanced the expression of G6PD by Nrf2 and
  activated the metabolic pathway of PPP, led to an increase of GSH, and reduced lipid
  peroxidation. Meanwhile, Dex antagonized sepsis-induced excessive mitochondrial
  fission to reduce ROS production.
