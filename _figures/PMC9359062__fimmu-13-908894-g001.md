caption: Summary of the immune-suppressive microenvironment induced by ALK-rearrangement.
  (A) Schematic diagram of the special immune TME of ALK-positive tumor. In ALK-positive
  tumors, CD30 is expressed continuously, and TCR signaling is inhibited. In the TME,
  the types of T cells changed, that is, the number of resting memory CD4+ T cells
  increased, while CD8+ T cells and activated memory CD4+ T cells were lacking. A
  variety of immunosuppressive cytokines are up-regulated, thereby inhibiting the
  killing ability of T cells and NK cells to tumor cells, and promoting the function
  of immunosuppressive cells. The special TME accumulates more Treg cells and TAM
  cells to promote immune evasion; (B) Mechanism of ALK rearrangement upregulating
  PD-L1 expression, which plays an essential role in mediating the process of PD-L1
  expression. ALK-rearranged protein can activate STAT3, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, and MEK-ERK
  signaling networks, which upregulate PD-L1 expression through transcription factors
  acting on the promoter region of PD-L1 gene. Activated mTOR can also recruit PD-L1
  transcripts to active polysomes at the post-transcriptional level. The JAK-STAT3-LATS-YAP/TAZ-PD-L1
  signaling pathway has gradually been shown to play an important role in mediating
  ALK-induced upregulation of PD-L1 in multiple cancer cell lines. Conversely, blocking
  the activation of the ALK pathway inhibits the expression of PD-L1.
