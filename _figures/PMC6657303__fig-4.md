caption: 'Schematic depiction of proadaptive and proapoptotic UPR pathways following
  ER stress. Protein misfolding triggers ER stress, which activates the UPR. UPR is
  aimed to restore homeostasis via proadaptive signaling; however, chronic/severe
  ER stress leads to cell death via the proapoptotic pathway. UPR is mediated via
  three transmembrane ER stress-sensors: IRE1, ATF6, and PERK. The three ER stress
  sensors are normally inactivated through binding with the molecular chaperone, Grp78.
  Misfolded proteins sequester Grp78 away, leading to activation of these proteins
  via either phosphorylation (PERK and IRE1) or translocation and cleavage at Golgi
  apparatus (ATF6). Several components of the proadaptive and proapoptotic UPR are
  activated following neonatal hypoxic–ischemic brain injury and contribute to ROS
  production/detoxification. See the  section for details. AP-1, activator protein-1;
