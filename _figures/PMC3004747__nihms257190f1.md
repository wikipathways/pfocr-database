caption: 'GDP-fucose can be synthesized in the cytoplasm from GDP-mannose (de novo
  pathway) or from free fucose (salvage pathway). Once synthesized, GDP-fucose is
  transported into the lumen of the ER/Golgi (drawn as a single compartment for simplicity)
  through one or more transporters (the ER transporter has not been identified). Fucose
  is transferred from GDP-fucose to acceptor substrates in the lumen of the ER (Pofut1,
  Pofut2) or Golgi (all other fucosyltransferases). Pofut1 fucosylates serine/threonines
  in Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGF) repeats, and Pofut2 fucosylates serine/threonines
  in Thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). Fucosylation leads to formation of cell-surface
  or secreted glycoproteins, some of which are shown on the surface of the cell or
  secreted. Although fucose occurs in many different types of structures, some specific
  examples are shown, including (from left to right): mucin-type O-glycans, N-glycans
  (both core and terminal fucosylation), O-fucose on TSRs, and O-fucose on EGF repeats.
  Note that Lewis type structures can occur on both N-glycan or mucin-type O-glycan
  cores. Known functions of fucosylated glycans are shown above each structure, including
  selectin recognition, pathogen binding, and a variety of signaling events (Notch,
  TGF-β1, EGF, integrins). For a more extensive review of fucosylation, see Becker
  and Lowe. Adapted from Smith et al. with permission **note: permission pending**.'
