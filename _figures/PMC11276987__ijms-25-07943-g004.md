caption: Unfolded protein response signaling with their regulating microRNAs. miRNAs
  have a crucial role in shaping the UPR, while miRNA expression is also regulated
  by UPR. miR-181, miR-30, miR-199a, miR-495, and miR-375 negatively regulate GRP78.
  On the other hand, miR-322 suppresses IRE1. XBP1 and RIDD signaling, members of
  IRE1 branch in UPR, regulate miR-153, miR-346, miR-34a, miR-17, miR-96, and miR-125b.
  Additionally, miR-34c, miR-665, and miR-30c are known to target XBP1, while miR-26a
  suppresses eIF2α, reducing the protein translation. Certain miRNAs also form a link
  between UPR branches. In this direction, PERK-mediated miR-30c activation inhibits
  XBP1 pathway and establishes a negative crosstalk between PERK and IRE1 branches
  of UPR. Reproduced from Demirel-Yalciner (2022) [80]
