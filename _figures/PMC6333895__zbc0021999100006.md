caption: Cell migration elicited by chemotactic GPCRs via the Gβγ–P-REX1–Rac pathway
  is mainly mediated by Gi over Gq or G13 because of the tight control that Gαq and
  Gα13 subunits exert on Gβγ. Based on our results, the model postulates that at the
  front of a migrating cell (left panel) Gi-coupled receptors release Gβγ to activate
  P-REX1/Rac and actin polymerization to move the cell forward, whereas Rho activating
  Gαq and Gα13 directly prevent Gβγ-dependent activation of Rac via P-REX1, contributing
  to explaining the general observation that chemotactic signaling transduced by GPCRs
  occurs via Gi. Because all heterotrimeric G proteins contain Gβγ, the lack of Rac
  activation by Gq and G13 is, according to our model, at least in part because of
  direct inhibition of Gβγ signaling by its Gαq and Gα13 counterparts. This model
  contributes to explaining why Gβγ signaling is preferentially linked to Gi-coupled
  receptors, which so far has been mainly attributed to higher abundance of Gi heterotrimers.
