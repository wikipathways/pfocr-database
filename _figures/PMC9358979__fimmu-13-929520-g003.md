caption: Aberrant mitophagy and redox disturbance cause multiple organs damage in
  SLE. SLE is a heterogeneous systemic autoimmune disease, affected multiple organs,
  such as kidney, nerves, gut and hematologic (non-immune cells). (A) Brain-Gut axis
  is novel therapeutic strategy on modulation of mitochondrial dyshomeostasis by neutralizing
  excessive ROS in microglial cells in neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). (B) Extracellular
  mitochondria (specifically platelets mitochondria and erythrocytes) serve as an
  immunogenic DNA, activated the cGAS–STING pathway, consequently trigger IFN-α production
  through binding to FcγRIIA in SLE. (C) The microbiota metabolites can directly interfere
  with the mitochondrial redox status in the host cells. Microbiota metabolites, such
  as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and tryptophan, play
  an essential role in regulation of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) integrity in
  SLE. (D) Impaired mitochondrial degradation in glomerular and tubular cells causes
  proteinuria and renal failure in LN. Iron loss-induced mitophagy is associated with
  the mitochondrial ferritin by nuclear receptor coactivator 4(NCOA4). Iron-induced
  injury of glomerular and tubular cells has been attributed to excessive mROS production,
  which contributes to drive NLRP3 inflammasome activation in SLE podocytes. Ubiquitin-proteasome
  system (UPS), Five respiratory complexes (complexes I–V), tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle.
