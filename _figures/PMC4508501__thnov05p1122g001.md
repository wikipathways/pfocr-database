caption: miRNA biogenesis process. A schematic representation of canonical miRNA biogenesis
  pathway. Each miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pri-miRNA) from genomic
  DNA within the nucleus; pri-miRNA is recognized by Drosha-DGCR8 and processed to
  pre-miRNA. Pre-miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm by exportin 5 (XPO5), where it
  is processed and cleaved by DICER complex to a double strand miRNA (miRNA*-miRNA).
  The duplex is cleaved, and only the mature miRNA is loaded into the RISC complex.
  The degree of homology of the miRNA “seed” to the 3′ UTR target sequence of the
  mRNA determines the mRNA translational repression or degradation.
