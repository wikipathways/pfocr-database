caption: 'Metabolic network analysis of identified rhythmic metabolites in iWAT. Hydrophilic
  metabolites with diurnal rhythm in the corresponding groups, (a) inter-tissue amino
  acid flux and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathway (b). Green boxes
  indicate metabolites involved in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism that
  are rhythmic in STD-VH-ZT12, CAF-GSPE-ZT12, or both groups; yellow boxes indicate
  metabolites that are rhythmic in both STD-VH-ZT12 and CAF-GSPE-ZT12 that are not
  involved in alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Abbreviations: ChoP, phosphorylcholine;
  GPC, glycerophosphocholine; Phe, phenylalanine; TAG, triacylglyceride; Glycerol
  3-P, glycerol 3-phosphate.'
