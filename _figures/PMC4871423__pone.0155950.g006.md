caption: 'Blocking RA-dependent signalling by androgen withdrawal therapy (AWT) first
  inhibits tumour growth, but soon alternative proliferative pathways are reactivated
  inducing tumour progression. Increased ErbB3 expression and subsequent reactivation
  of the PI3K pathway in response to AWT is a major mechanism of tumour resistance.
  Alternatively, we report here the nuclear accumulation of ErbB380kDa, a variant
  lacking the ligand-binding and transmembrane domain of ErbB3180kDa, in advanced
  PCa resistant to therapy (CRPC). As a co-regulator for the transcription of genes
  associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, ErbB380kDa
  is likely to be strongly involved in therapy resistance and progression to fatal
  PCa. DHT: dihydrotestosterone; AR: androgen receptor; ARE: androgen responsive elements.'
