caption: Proposed pathway for the induction of EC PAF synthesis by VEGF. The synthesis
  of PAF upon Flk-1 autophosphorylation by VEGF is predominantly mediated through
  the activation of a Ras-independent pathway (PLCγ and PKC) (solid line), promoting
  the downstream activation of the Raf and p42/44 MAPK pathway. In addition, VEGF
  activates the MKK-3/6 which induces the activation of p38 MAPK. Both p42/44 and
  p38 MAPK are known to activate the phospholipid remodelling pathway which leads
  to PAF synthesis. Meanwhile, Flk-1 autophosphorylation also activates PI3K, which
  appears to act as a negative regulator of PAF synthesis in BAEC (dashed line). Since
  VEGF-induced p42/44 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were not affected by Wortmannin
  or LY294002, PI3K likely exerts its inhibitory effect downstream of p42/44 and p38
  MAPK. Hence, the PI3K pathway might act on PAF synthesis in BAEC by downregulating
  the activity of the phospholipid remodelling pathway.
