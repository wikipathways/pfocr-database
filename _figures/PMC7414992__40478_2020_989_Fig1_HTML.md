caption: LT biosynthesis is part of metabolism of the omega 6 polyunsaturated arachidonic
  acid (AA), which is cleaved from plasmamembranes by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). AA
  is a substrate for several lipoxygenases. For the production of LTs it is first
  converted into 5-hydroxy-peroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and afterwards into
  LTA4, both steps mediated by a complex of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-Lox) and
  5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) []. From LTA4 arise either Leukotriene
  B4 (LTB4) formed by epoxide hydrolase or Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) formed by LTC4 synthase,
  which can be further metabolized to LTD4 and LTE4 []. LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 are summarized
  under the term cysteinyl-leukotrienes (CysLTs). CysLTs display different affinities
  towards the receptors cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 and 2 (CysLT1R []), CysLT2R
  []) and G-protein coupled receptor 17 (GPR17 [, ]). The enzyme 5-Lox is also involved
  in some steps of biosynthesis of specialized pro-resolving mediators from omega
  3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (DHA – docosahexaenoic acid; EPA – eicosapentaenoic
  acid)
