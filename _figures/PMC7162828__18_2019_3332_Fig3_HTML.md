caption: 'A schematic presentation of selected cellular processes influenced by KYNA.
  KYNA inhibits phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt), extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK 1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) []. The effect
  of KYNA on phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B PI3K/Akt pathway may lead
  to disruption of various cellular processes including proliferation, cell cycle,
  cell survival and migration. Interaction between KYNA and ERK pathway may affect
  the processes of differentiation, proliferation or apoptosis, whereas interaction
  between KYNA and p38 pathway may affect the processes of proliferation, cell motility,
  apoptosis, stress response and inflammation. Moreover, KYNA enhances the protein
  expression of β-catenin which is involved in adhesion, development, cell survival
  and proliferation. The potential relationship between AhR (a) and GPR35 (b) receptors
  and mentioned signalling pathways is presented; however, the specific mechanism
  of KYNA interactions has not been fully elucidated. a KYNA is an agonist of the
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor AhR. According to the biological effects of AhR activation,
  three possible types of interactions may be suggested: via PI3K/Akt pathway, ERK
  signalling pathway or by activation of the expression of xenobiotic and non-xenobiotic
  target genes (based on [–]). b KYNA activates G-protein-coupled receptor 35 (GPR35)
  which may lead to inhibition of phosphorylation of various signalling proteins,
  including Akt, ERK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38). Additionally,
  activation of GPR35 may lead to increase in β-catenin expression (based on [, ]).
  c KYNA enhances the protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor
  p21Waf1/Cip1 resulting in possible inhibition of cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6, cyclin E/CDK2,
  cyclin A/CDK2 and cyclin B/CDK1 complexes which may lead to cell cycle arrest and
  antiproliferative activity []'
