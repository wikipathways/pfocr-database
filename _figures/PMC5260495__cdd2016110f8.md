caption: A schematic diagram shows that CD9 binds to gp130 and stabilizes gp130 by
  blocking its ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation to promote the BMX-mediated
  STAT3 activation in GSCs. The binding of CD9 to gp130 prevents gp130 from ubiquitination
  and lysosomal degradation, thus facilitates the signal transduction of the IL-6-gp130-BMX-STAT3
  signaling pathway in GSCs to maintain GSC self-renewal and tumorigenic potential

  lysosomal degradation to promote STAT3 activation in glioma stem cells.
