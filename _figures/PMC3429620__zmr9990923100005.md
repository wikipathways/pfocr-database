caption: Depictions of microbial interactions. Examples of bacterial interactions
  with diatoms are shown, categorized as competitive (purple), synergistic (orange),
  and parasitic (blue). An example of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as evidence for
  past associations between diatoms and bacteria is also shown (green). Small rectangles
  with flagella represent bacteria; the large dark green rectangle (center) represents
  a diatom cell. Key reactions involved in the interactions are depicted within respective
  cells. The background gradient and dashed line represent the phycosphere. In the
  nutrient-poor regions of the oceans, bacteria and diatoms often encounter limiting
  resources for which competition may be established. Bacteria and diatoms both produce
  membrane-bound enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase and 5′-nucleotidases (triangles),
  to break down dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Unless coupled directly to an
  uptake mechanism, consequent release of orthophosphate into the surrounding seawater
  may result in competitive uptake by both organisms, with bacteria generally outcompeting
  diatoms at low concentrations (). One way to avoid such competition is to establish
  a synergistic mutualism, in which an exchange of resources increases the fitness
  of both organisms. For example, some diatoms lack a B12-independent methionine synthase
  gene (metE) and thus require an exogenous source of vitamin B12 to synthesize methionine.
  Many bacteria can produce B12, thus providing a source for diatoms (). In return,
  the bacteria would benefit from dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced by the diatoms.
  Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria have been shown to supply fixed nitrogen to diatoms,
  likely in the form of ammonia or dissolved organic nitrogen (). Some bacteria produce
  the highly photolabile siderophore vibrioferrin, which has been shown recently to
  supply soluble iron to algal cells, presumably in exchange for DOM (). In this case,
  bacterial growth is significantly enhanced in the presence of the algae, providing
  further evidence for a mutualistic interaction. A subset of bacteria possesses the
  ability to utilize a by-product of algal photorespiration, glycolate, with the potential
  consequence of shifting bacterial community dynamics over diel cycles (). In the
  category of parasitic interactions, we include interactions that directly parasitize
  or defend against such parasitism. Desbois et al. have shown that the fatty acid
  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) produced by the diatom P. tricornutum is an effective
  antimicrobial agent against known human pathogens (). The compound appears to be
  less effective against marine bacteria. Algicidal bacteria can attack diatoms through
  attachment and/or release of enzymes that degrade the diatom's organic matrix, which
  protects the silica frustule from dissolution. Furusawa et al. demonstrated the
  attachment of a Saprospira sp. to a diatom and subsequent release of fibril-like
  materials that appear to aid in decomposition of the cell wall (). The algicidal
  bacterium Kordia algicida appears to produce a diffusible protease responsible for
  the killing activity (). In a similar system, Lee et al. characterized the protease
  from a Pseudoalteromonas sp. as a serine protease (). Horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
  represents the footprint of ancient associations between bacteria and diatoms. Horizontal
  transfer of genetic material, hypothesized to originate from bacteria in close associations
  with diatoms, has shaped the metabolic potential of modern diatom species. In one
  example, a key offshoot pathway of the urea cycle in diatoms, catalyzed by carbamate
  kinase (CBK), appears to be encoded by a gene with no phylogenetic associations
  with other known eukaryotes ().
