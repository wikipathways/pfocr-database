caption: (A) Planktonic, free-swimming cells are flagellated, have low c-di-GMP, and,
  as a result of low sensitivity to QSSMs, exhibit low virulence even when a quorum
  is reached. Upon encountering a host cell surface, flagellum-mediated surface sensing
  leads to a rapid increase in c-di-GMP, although virulence remains low in reversibly
  attached cells. (B) Once cells commit to a surface and become irreversibly attached,
  virulence is further induced via type IV pili-mediated cAMP production. Vfr binds
  cAMP, activating the transcription of Vfr-regulated virulence genes, including those
  of the T2SS and T3SS. Virulence factors secreted by the T2SS include the elastases
  LasA and LasB, the protease, alkaline protease A, exotoxin A, and pyocyanin, while
  the T3SS secretes various cytotoxins directly into host cells. Vfr also regulates
  the LasR QS system, as well as the adhesin, PilY1, such that both LasR and PilY1
  are up-regulated upon surface attachment. Surface-attached cells demonstrate increased
  sensitivity to the las QSSMs, causing LasR targets to be more strongly induced.
  LasR and PilY1 are also important for mediating surface-induced cytotoxicity via
  their effect on the pqsABCD operon and production of the AQs, including HHQ. PilY1,
  as well as the Wsp surface-sensing pathway, lead to signalling cascades that result
  in increased c-di-GMP. (C) Eventually, once c-di-GMP is sufficiently high, surface-committed
  cells start to form microcolonies and biofilms. At this stage, the bacteria lose
  their motility, down-regulate, or lose many of their host-directed virulence mechanisms,
  such as the T3SS and the lasR QS system, and upregulate the T6SS, important for
  inter-bacterial competition. Figure created on BioRender.com.
