caption: Proposed role of Mms4–Mus81 in resolving stalled replication forks and meiotic
  recombination intermediates. (A) Replication fork arrest. A replication fork that
  encounters DNA damage (in this case, on the leading strand template) arrests and
  can be resolved by one of two pathways. In the left pathway, Sgs1 and Top3 (dark
  gray ovals) remove the nascent DNA (gray) from the parental duplex by virtue of
  its helicase and decatenation activities. The fate of these strands is not shown
  and they may be degraded. The ssDNA template formed in this step nucleates stabilization
  and replication proteins (gray circles), while the DNA repair machinery (white circles)
  fixes the damage. Newly loaded replication proteins (data not shown) re-establish
  fork movement. In the pathway at right, Mms4–Mus81 cleaves the leading strand template
  from the stalled fork. Following repair of the damage, ssDNA gaps are filled in.
  The DSB is repaired by a form of homologous recombination off the sister chromatid,
  which is initiated by the 3′ end of the cleaved arm invading the sister duplex.
  Extension of the invading strand creates a D-loop, lagging strand synthesis, and
  establishment of a replication fork. (B) Meiotic DSBs that occur in regions of heterogeneity
  initiate homologous recombination by pairing with target sequences on the homologous
  chromosome. The nonhomologous 3′ end is a substrate for cleavage by Mms4–Mus81.
  This creates the appropriate 3′ terminus, which allows elongation by DNA polymerase
  and subsequent formation of HJs.
