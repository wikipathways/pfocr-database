caption: 'Negative regulation of the autophagy pathway. Schematic representation of
  the autophagy pathway and its negative regulation in mammalian cells. Autophagy
  proceeds through a series of steps including signal transduction, membrane nucleation,
  elongation, and completion of the autophagosome, autophagosome maturation by fusion
  with a lysosome, followed by degradation of autophagic cargoes, and recycling of
  the resulting molecules. Negative regulation occurs at each dynamic step. Autophagy
  induction is directly and tightly controlled by the ‘nutrient sensor’ mTOR, which
  senses and integrates signals from numerous sources including growth factors, amino
  acids, hypoxia, and energy levels. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTOR associates
  with the ULK1 complex comprised of ULK1 (mammalian Atg1), mammalian Atg13 (mAtg13),
  and FIP200 (mammalian Atg17), and phophorylates ULK1 and mAtg13 to repress autophagy.
  On inactivation of mTOR by upstream signaling, it dissociates from the ULK1 complex,
  triggering the autophagy cascade. Autophagosome nucleation is confined to phosphatidylinositol-3phosphate
  (PtdIns(3)P)-containing vesicles and is driven by the Beclin1-associated PI3KC3
  complex. The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and its interactor, NAF-1, negatively regulate
  autophagy by sequestering Beclin1 from the complex, thereby restricting the production
  of PtdIns(3)-P. Similarly, the PtdIns(3)-P phosphatase, Jumpy, catalyzes the reverse
  reaction of PtdIns(3)-P hydrolysis to inhibit autophagy. Beclin1 can also be cleaved
  by caspases, which destroys its proautophagic activity. Two ubiquitin-like conjugation
  systems are involved in autophagosomal membrane expansion and completion: one is
  LC3–phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugation and the other is Atg12–Atg5 conjugation.
  The interaction of LC3 with the E2-like enzyme, Atg3, is inhibited by FLIP, whereas
  Atg5 cleavage by calpain attenuates Atg5–Atg12 conjugation, resulting in apoptosis
  through the formation of a complex with Bcl-xL in the mitochondria. Autophagosome
  fusion with the lysosome signifies the maturation stage of autophagy, a step that
  is least understood but found to be suppressed by the Rubicon complex (Rubicon–UVRAG–Beclin1–PI3KC3–p150).
  Finally, the end products of proteolysis suppress autophagy by upregulating mTOR
  signaling, serving as a negative feedback loop'
