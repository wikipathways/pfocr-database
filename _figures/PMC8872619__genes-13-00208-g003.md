caption: Network representation of lncRNAs and miRNAs gene targets for prostate cell
  senescence. Only genes related to DNA Repair are presented. The gene target EGFR
  (belonging to the Prostate Cancer KEGG pathway) is highlighted as is FOXM1, CDK1,
  (from the Cellular Senescence pathway). The lncRNAs LINC00152 and LINC00313 are
  not depicted as they do not have any gene target mapping to either the Prostate
  Cancer and Cellular Senescence pathways. Blue indicates down-regulated and red up-regulated
  in senescent cells relative to non senescent cells. Genes are presented as rectangles,
  miRNAs as triangles, and lncRNAs as octagons. EGFR, FOXM1, CDK1 are indicated with
  arrows.
