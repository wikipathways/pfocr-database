caption: Adhesion of colon cancer cells to endothelial cells expressing E-selectin
  induces a reverse signaling in the cancer cells that increases their motile potential,
  and a forward signaling in the endothelial cells that increases inter-endothelial
  permeability and enables extravasation. For example, adhesion of colon carcinoma
  cells to endothelial cells involves the binding of E-selectin on endothelial cells
  to Death Receptor-3 (DR3) on cancer cells. This interaction induces the reverse
  activation of p38, ERK and PI3 kinases in cancer cells, which increases their motile
  and survival potentials. In contrast, caspases (3 and 8) are not activated and caspase-dependent
  apoptosis is impaired. Reciprocally, the interaction between DR3 and E-selectin
  triggers the forward activation of the same MAP kinase pathways in endothelial cells.
  This results in myosin-light chain (MLC)-mediated cell retraction and in dissociation
  via ERK and Src activation of the VE-cadherin/β–Catenin complex and thereby destruction
  of adherens junctions leading to increased endothelial permeability and extravasation
  of cancer cells.
