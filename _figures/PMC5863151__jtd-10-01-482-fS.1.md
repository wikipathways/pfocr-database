caption: Estrogen pathway in lung carcinogenesis and its implications for targeted
  therapy. (A) Estrogen signaling in lung cancer. Lung adenocarcinoma microenvironment
  exhibits high levels of estrogen (E2) that come from circulation or are produced
  in situ by aromatase (ARO) which is overexpressed in LC. Estrogen receptor beta
  (ERβ) is also overexpressed in LC and dimers when is activated by estrogen. Through
  a non-genomic pathway it activates EGFR, MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, resulting
  in proliferation, cell survival, tumor growth and angiogenesis. In the non-genomic
  pathway, the E2/ER complex translocates to the nucleus and binds to DNA estrogen
  response elements (ERE) and through co-activators (Co-Ac) induces expression of
  several genes. Several of these have been seen in lung cancer to promote proliferation,
  cell cycle progression (Cycline-D, Id proteins, c-myc) and angiogenesis (VEGF).
  It remains under investigation whether CXCL12 is an estrogen-regulated gene, but
  CXCR4 is up-regulated by estrogen and CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling promotes proliferation,
  cell survival, angiogenesis, migration and metastases in lung cancer; (B) antiestrogenic
  drugs in LC treatment. Use of aromatase inhibitors, selective estrogen-receptor
  response modulators (SERMs) and ER-down regulators have shown promising results
  in lung cancer treatment in preclinical and clinical trials inhibiting ER, MAPK,
  AKT, EGFR, CXCR4 pathways signaling. Combined tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
  and antiestrogenic therapy has shown potentiated effects in lung cancer treatment.
