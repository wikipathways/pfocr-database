caption: 'A: A schema for glycolysis-, TCA-cycle-, and mitochondrial electron transport
  system-related metabolic pathway. The raw data of the metabolite assay is shown
  in . The selection of  can be found in . The upward pointing arrows indicate that
  the contents of the metabolites associated with these arrows were significantly
  (p≤0.05) induced by M4N in at least two out of three cell lines (LNCaP, AsPC-1,
  and L428 cells) under the additional condition that the effect of M4N on the contents
  of these metabolites in the third cell line was an induction without statistical
  significant difference, no significant change, or not examined. Meanwhile the downward
  pointing arrows indicate that the contents of the metabolites associated with these
  arrows were significantly (p≤0.05) suppressed by M4N in at least two out of three
  cell lines (LNCaP, AsPC-1, and L428 cells) under the additional condition that the
  effect of M4N on the contents of these metabolites in the third cell line was a
  suppression without statistical significant difference, no significant change, or
  not examined. The exceptions for these rules are glucose 6-phosphate (whose content
  was suppressed by M4N in all three cell lines but the difference was statistically
  significant only in L428 cells), 3-phosphoglycerate (whose content was significantly
  induced by M4N in LNCaP but not in AsPC-1 and L428 cells) and pyruvate (whose content
  was significantly induced by M4N in AsPC-1 and L428 cells but significantly suppressed
  in LNCaP cells). 3-Phosphoglycerate and pyruvate are marked with associated upward
  pointing arrows because the data () indicated that M4N accumulated these metabolites
  and stalled glycolysis, although how M4N affected these metabolites was variable
  depending on the cell line (refer to the text). The effect of M4N on ATP content
  in the whole cells is shown in . The effect of M4N on NDUFS1 expression is shown
  in . The result indicating the increase in mRNA expression of phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase 2 (PCK2) and asparagine synthase (ASNS) by M4N (80 μM) treatment for
  6 h was from deep RNA sequencing analysis shown in . B: A schema for lipid metabolic
  pathway. The meanings of the upward and downward pointing arrows in this schema
  are the same as those in the schema for glucolysis-, TCA-cycle-, and mitochondrial
  electron transport system-related metabolic pathway (Fig 5A). Long chain fatty acyl-carnitine
  includes palmitoylcarnitine (16:1) and oleoylcarnitine (18:1). When fatty acids
  are degraded through β-oxidation cycle, they need to be converted to acyl-carnitines
  to be transported inside the mitochondria. Thus the data indicated that M4N should
  suppress β-oxidation cycle by reducing production of long chain acyl-carnitines.'
