caption: Vitamin B6 salvage pathway. PLP is produced both via the de novo pathway
  in organisms containing PDX1 and PDX2 as well as by conversion from PNP or PMP via
  the PNP/PMP oxidase. PMP oxidation can also be catalyzed by transaminases. PN, PM,
  and PL are phosphorylated by the action of a PL/PN/PM kinase or by an additional
  PL-specific kinase for PLP. Phosphorylated derivatives are dephosphorylated by phosphatases.
  PL can also be converted to PN by a PL reductase. This pathway is based on data
  from E. coli, yeast, B. subtilis, and mammals.
