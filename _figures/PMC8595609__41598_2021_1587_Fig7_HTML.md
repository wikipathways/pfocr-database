caption: 'Overview of probable roles of differentially regulated TDFs during Fusarium
  wilt of pigeonpea. Green arrow: up-regulation; red arrow: down-regulation; black
  arrow: possible outcome due to up- or down- regulation of genes; golden arrow: elaborated
  pathway; blue font: genes differentially regulated in cDNA-AFLP; black font: other
  molecular factors with probable involvement, probable outcome of pathways. Inset
  (a): WRKY70-mediated cross-talk between Salicylic acid (SA)- and Jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent
  defense signaling; Inset (b): role of VQ4 during defense signaling against pathogen;
  Inset (c,d): regulation of RD19 (c), AIG1 and RPM1 (d,) related to effector triggered
  immunity (ETI); Inset (e): Regulation of genes related to vascular development.
