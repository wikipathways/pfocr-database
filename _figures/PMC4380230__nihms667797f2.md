caption: 'A, In diabetes, hyperglycemia triggers mainly increased ROS production through
  eNOS uncoupling and PPP impairment resulting in stalled glycolytic flux with glycolytic
  intermediates being diverted into alternative metabolic pathways leading to additional
  excess ROS and AGEs production. B, Atherosclerosis is characterized at a metabolic
  level mainly by eNOS uncoupling resulting in excess ROS production and loss of NO-dependent
  vasodilation. Abbreviations used: as in . 1,3BPG: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 3DG:
