caption: Shows that aging induces epigenetic changes such as DNA hypermethylation,
  which can be inhibited by EGCG and genistein. Resveratrol counteracts the histone
  modifications caused by aging. These epigenetic alterations disrupt molecular pathways,
  but polyphenols have the potential to modulate these pathways and protect against
  fat accumulation in the body
