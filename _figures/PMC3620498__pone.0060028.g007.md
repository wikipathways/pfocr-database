caption: Ectopic expression of Willin activates the Hippo signaling pathway and YAP
  translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It also promotes wound closure
  by directional migration without increased cellular proliferation and induces down-regulation
  of ephrinB2 and EGFR expression. Knockdown of Willin expression further supports
  the aforementioned findings.
