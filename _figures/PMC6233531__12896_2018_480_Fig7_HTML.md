caption: Scheme with simplified protein synthesis and folding pathways comparing CGTase
  expression by E. coli in the absence and presence of cyclodextrin. The unfolded
  CGTase protein is drawn as a green line, while the signal peptide is drawn as a
  bold brown line. The orange segments in the green lines represent amino acids with
  hydrophobic side chains, and the blue rings represent CD molecules. Unfolded CGTase
  is synthetized by the ribosome complex and transported through the Sec-dependent
  pathway with the help of cellular proteins SecB, DnaK, SRP and SecA, as well as
  the membrane protein Sec-complex. In the periplasmic space, unfolded CGTase is either
  folded into an active protein or misfolded and aggregated into inclusion bodies
