caption: Schematic model for the roles of p120 catenin in the signaling pathways  leading
  to growth factor–induced RhoA stimulation and cell migration.  Under unstimulated
  conditions Ras/PI3K and the small GTPases RhoA and Rac are  present in the cell
  in an inactive state, and p120 catenin is mainly bound to  cadherin complexes. On
  engagement of RTKs (Met) by growth factors (HGF) and  ensuing activation of Ras,
  signals are propagated downstream in order to  activate Rac1 transiently and RhoA
  steadily. The integrity of the PI3K  pathway, but not of the MEK pathway, appears
  to play a critical role in  activation of Rho GT-Pases. Long-term activation of
  RhoA, which is required  for epithelial-mesenchimal transition, on the one hand
  appears to be  negatively controlled by Rac and on the other hand is achieved through
  the  collaboration of a Ras-independent pathway originated at the cell surface and  involving
  the integrity of p120 catenin. All these pathways likely converge  either on a direct
  interaction of p120 with RhoA or on yet undefined  regulators of the GEF (e.g.,
  Vav2) or GAP families. It is postulated that in  order to coordinately modulate
  cell motility and weaken cell–cell  adhesion, RTK activation somewhat impinges on
  p120 catenin function, by  posttranslational modifications at the N-terminus or
  by affecting its  localization. One likely candidate is c-Src tyrosine kinase that
  lies  downstream of RTKs and may control cell motility acting both upstream, by  affecting
  p120 phosphorylation state, and downstream of RhoA.
