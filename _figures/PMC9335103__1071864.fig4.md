caption: Integrated network analysis of differentially expressed genes in the three
  disease groups. (A) STRING-based network (149 nodes; 209 edges) for differentially
  expressed genes between PTCL-EBV and ENKTL. NFKB1 and TLR8 are network hubs based
  on betweenness centrality calculations. (B) STRING-based network (45 nodes; 52 edges)
  for differentially expressed genes between PTCL-EBV and PTCL-NOS. BIRC3 and TLR8
  are network hubs based on betweenness centrality calculations. Nodes are sized based
  on their degree (i.e., number of incoming edges). Genes that fall within the most
  enriched gene ontology process for each network — which are (A) “Regulation of Immune
  System Process” and (B) “immune response” — are indicated in yellow. All other genes
  are colored light purple.
