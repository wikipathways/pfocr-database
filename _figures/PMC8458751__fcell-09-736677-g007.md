caption: The modified NAFLD pathogenesis map showing epigenetic regulatory signatures
  in steatosis and NASH. (A) Predicted NAFLD pathogenesis genes targeted by differentially
  expressed miRNAs in the group of patients with steatosis are highlighted; (B) Predicted
  NAFLD pathogenesis genes targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs in the group
  of patients with NASH are highlighted. Pink—genes targeted by downregulated miRNAs;
  light blue—genes targeted by upregulated miRNAs; purple—genes targeted by both up-
  and downregulated miRNAs. The pathway was imported from WikiPathways.
