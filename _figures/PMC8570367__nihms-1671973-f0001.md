caption: The glutaminolysis pathway and its inhibitors.Glutamine is an important nitrogen
  and carbon source for actively proliferating cells, especially glutamine-addicted
  cancer cells, and is an essential building block for numerous biosynthesis processes,
  such as the synthesis of glutathione, NADPH, nucleotides, and fatty acids. Glutamine
  can be imported from the extracellular space via alanine, serine, cysteine transporter
  2 (ASCT2). Glutamine is then converted to glutamate by either glutaminase 1 (GLS1)
  or glutaminase 2 (GLS2). Glutamate is then converted to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG).
  This reaction can be catalyzed by either glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) generating
  one equivalent of ammonia or by transaminases in which the nitrogen is incorporated
  into other amino acids. α-KG can be incorporated into the TCA cycle and its carbon
  converted to malate, oxaloacetate (OAA), and citrate subsequently. Malate can be
  transported from the mitochondrion to the cytoplasm, where it is a substrate of
  the malic enzyme 1 (ME1), thereby assisting in the production of NADPH from NADP+.
  OAA can be converted to aspartate and transported to the cytoplasm to participate
  in nucleotide synthesis. α-KG can also be transported to the cytoplasm as a source
  of acetyl-CoA, which is an essential substrate of fatty acid synthesis. There are
  several drugs developed to inhibit different parts of the glutaminolysis pathway.
  The first type is exemplified by glutamine analogs, such as DON, acivicin, and azaserine.
  The second group is represented by the SLC1A5 inhibitors, including GPNA and V-9302.
  Last, GLS1/2 is also a promising target for glutaminolysis inhibition. Several noncompetitive
  allosteric inhibitors have been identified, such as CB-839, BPTES, and compound
  968.
