caption: 'Upregulated protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway genes in
  the genotype SNJ201126. Genes indicated in green: Upregulated in response to water
  deficit stress only in SNJ201126. Genes indicated in blue: Upregulated in response
  to water deficit stress in both the genotypes. However, the upregulation was several
  folds higher in the genotype SNJ201126 (color figure online)'
