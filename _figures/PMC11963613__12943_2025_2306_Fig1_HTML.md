caption: This figure illustrates the role of the APC gene within the Wnt signaling
  pathway and its significance as a cancer biomarker. It begins by depicting the normal
  Wnt signaling process, highlighting the sequential activation of Wnt ligands, receptors,
  and the downstream destruction complex. A key focus is on the APC destruction complex,
  showing its role in regulating β-catenin levels under normal conditions. The figure
  also demonstrates how APC gene mutations disrupt this complex, leading to the abnormal
  accumulation of β-catenin, a critical event in cancer initiation and progression
