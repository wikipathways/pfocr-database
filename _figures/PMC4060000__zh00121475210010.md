caption: Schematic diagram demonstrating the effects of cytokines on signaling pathways
  mediating sustained contraction in colonic longitudinal smooth muscle cells. Sustained
  contraction in response to ACh is mediated by activation of Rho kinase and ZIP kinase
  and phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC20 via Gα12/LARG/RhoA pathway. IL-1β or TNF-α
  stimulates JNK activity and increases LARG expression leading to stimulation of
  RhoA/Rho kinase/ZIP kinase pathway and augmentation of sustained muscle contraction.
  Increase in sustained contraction by cytokines is facilitated by concomitant decrease
  in telokin expression and MLCP activity.
