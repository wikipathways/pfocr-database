caption: Several important types of RCD. Apoptosis includes both intrinsic and extrinsic
  pathways. The intrinsic pathway mainly depends on caspase-8 to activate BAX/BAK
  in the mitochondria, release cytochrome C, and promote the activation of pro-caspase-3
  and pro-caspase-7 forming caspase-3 and caspase-7. In the extrinsic pathway, caspase-8
  directly promotes the formation of caspase-3 and caspase-7, thus inducing apoptosis.
  Activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 can cleave GSDMD and GSDME to form GSDMD-NT and
  GSDME-NT, which can be adsorbed on the cell membrane and create holes, thus destroying
  the intracellular environmental homeostasis and inducing pyroptosis. TNF binding
  to receptors can activate CYLD and promote RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL to form trimers.
  Caspase-8 and the dimer formed by FADD in FAS bind to RIP1 to form complex IIa-RDA,
  which promotes this binding reaction and ultimately RIP1-RIP3-MLKL trimer binds
  to the cell membrane to induce necroptosis. The caspase family plays a major role
  in the pathogenesis of apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. Apoptosis and necroptosis
  tend to change the cell membrane structure and intracellular physical and chemical
  properties, and pyroptosis can directly drill into the cell membrane through the
  GSDM protein, destroying the integrity of the cell membrane. Therefore, reasonably
  inducing the occurrence of these kinds of RCDs can effectively eradicate cancer
  cells. Caspase-8 plays an important role in caspase-dependent RCD.
