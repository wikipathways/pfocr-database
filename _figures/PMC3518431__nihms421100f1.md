caption: 'Two major signalling pathways are depicted here: the pathway involving class
  I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB) and mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and a cyclical mTOR-independent pathway; the basic
  helix–loop–helix leucine zipper transcription factor EB (TFEB)-mediated pathway
  is also depicted. TFEB regulates the expression of the genes involved in the different
  stages of autophagy between autophagosome formation and cargo degradation (see ).
  In nutrient-rich medium, TFEB is phosphorylated by mTORC1 and is retained in the
  cytoplasm. In starved cells, TFEB is dephosphorylated and is translocated into the
  nucleus. TFEB is a potential target for drugs. Retaining TFEB in the cytoplasm would
  inhibit autophagy, as illustrated in the figure. By contrast, promoting the nuclear
  translocation of TFEB would stimulate autophagy. Activating the class I PI3K–PKB–mTORC1
  pathway by growth factors and amino acids blocks autophagy by inhibiting the initiation
  of autophagosome formation by the UNC51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex. Glucose starvation
  increases the AMP/ATP ratio, which activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
  This enzyme induces autophagy by inhibiting mTORC1 (via directly targeting elements
  of the complex) or by phosphorylating and activating tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC2)
  in the TSC1–TSC2 complex. Recent data suggest that mTOR interacts with TFEB, as
  the two proteins are colocalized on lysosomal membranes. Phosphorylation of mTOR
  inhibits TFEB acivity, whereas ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors enable TFEB dephosphorylation,
  thus allowing its nuclear translocation and activation. AMPK also phosphorylates
  and thus activates the ULK1 complex. Activators of AMPK (such as metformin) stimulate
  autophagy, as do inhibitors of mTORC1 (for example, rapamycin or rapalogues) and
  inhibitors of class I PI3Ks (for example, PI-103). Amino acids activate mTORC1 via
  RAG GTPases, and also via the vacuolar V-ATPase located in the lysosomal membrane.
  Inhibitors of V-ATPases, such as bafilomycin A1, block the maturation of autophagosomes.
  However, blocking V-ATPase also inhibits the amino-acid-dependent activation of
  mTORC1, which would have a stimulatory effect on autophagosome formation. Elevation
  of the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) by adenylyl cyclase downstream
  of G protein-coupled receptors blocks autophagy by activating the exchange protein
  directly activated by cAMP (EPAC), the small G protein RAP2B and phospholipase Cε
  (PLCε). Activation of PLCε results in the production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and, consequently, the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum
  via the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor (Ins(1,4,5)P3R). Influx of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm
  is also triggered by l-type Ca2+ channel agonists. Drugs acting at the various different
  steps of the cAMP–EPAC–PLCε– Ins(1,4,5)P3pathway regulate autophagy. Calpains activated
  by Ca2+ block autophagy by cleaving and constitutively activating Gsα proteins (also
  called Gαs), which increases cAMP levels. Thus, inhibitors of calpains would stimulate
  autophagy in this setting. The binding of B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) to beclin 1
  inhibits autophagy, and this effect can be counteracted by BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3)
  mimetics. DAG, diacylglycerol; IMPase, inositol monophosphatase; InsP, inositol
  monophosphate; Ins(1,4)P2, inositol-1,4-bisphosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate;
  RHEB, RAS homologue enriched in brain (GTP binding protein).'
