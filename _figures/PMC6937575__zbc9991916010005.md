caption: The CD38/cADPR/NAADP-signaling pathway. Type III CD38, present in the ER
  and plasma membrane, cyclizes cytosolic NAD to produce cellular cADPR (PDB entry
  2O3Q), which targets the ryanodine receptor in the ER and releases Ca2+ from the
  store. The activity of the type III CD38 is modulated by CIB1, a Ca2+-binding regulator.
  Type II CD38 is expressed on the cell surface and can be internalized through endocytosis
  to the endolysosomes, where the acidic lumen is conducive for NAADP production.
  Transporters internalized together with the type II CD38 facilitate the movement
  of NAADP (PDB entry 4F45) into the cytosol, where it targets Ca2+ channels, such
  as the two-pore channel, in the acidic Ca2+ stores. CZ48 (PDB entry 3ROM) is a mimetic
  of NMN and is cell-permeant. It induces dimerization and conformational changes
  in SARM1, releasing the catalytic TIR domain from the autoinhibition of the ARM
  domain. The amino segment of SARM1 is associated with the mitochondria, whereas
  the TIR is facing the cytosol. The activated SARM1 cyclizes NAD to produce cADPR
  in a manner similar to CD38.
