caption: Role of the IL-2 pathway and the Teff/Treg balance in the tissue. This figure
  depicts how the balance of Teff and Tregs and their complex interactions, notably
  the IL-2 pathway, results in destruction or protection of pancreatic islets (see
  text for details). A magnified view of the outcome of IL-2 signaling in Tregs is
  shown at the bottom. In islets or individuals in which protection is dominant (left
  panel), the Teff/Treg ratio is skewed toward regulation; Teff secrete significant
  amounts of IL-2; IL-2 binds to the IL-2 receptor, expressed at high levels on Tregs,
  which triggers a robust IL-2 signaling, including high levels of STAT5 phosphorylation;
  this, in turn, ultimately results in the transcription of many IL-2 dependent genes,
  including Foxp3, which are important to maintain their survival at the tissue site.
  In individuals genetically susceptible to diabetes (right panel), the survival of
  Tregs in the islets is compromised and they cannot control the Teff pathogenic response;
  the half-life or levels of secretion of IL-2 by Teff is deficient; IL-2 signaling
  is reduced because of lower expression of the IL-2 receptor and/or lower STAT5 phosphorylation;
  this results in altered transcription of IL-2-dependent genes and poor survival
  of Tregs in the islets.
