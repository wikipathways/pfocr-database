caption: LRRK2’s potential involvement in pre- and post-synaptic pathways. (A) Cartoon
  of a generalized presynaptic terminal showing processes in which LRRK2 has been
  implicated. Synaptic vesicles (SVs; large black circles), and their cycling (blue
  arrows) regulate the loading of neurotransmitters (small black circles), which are
  released by Ca2+-dependent fusion at the synaptic active zone into the synaptic
  cleft. SVs are retrieved by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (black triskelia), and/or
  bulk endocytosis, and subsequent clathrin coating/uncoating. Vesicles are recycled
  through endosomal intermediates back into the vesicle cycle. Various members of
  the Rab GTPase family, many of which are LRRK2 substrates, regulate nearly all steps
  of this cycle (see text), and other major molecular regulators are named, and marked,
  depending on the proposed LRRK2 association; putative LRRK2 kinase substrates*,
  physical LRRK2 binding+, and functional interactions with a mechanism to be determined∧.
  (i) Calcium (Ca2+) flux and buffering may be altered by pathogenic LRRK2 mutations,
  as LRRK2 regulates CaV2.1 voltage-gated calcium channels (Bedford et al., ), and
  mitochondrial homeostasis (Cherra et al., ; Verma et al., ); disruption of these
  processes would create downstream effects on Ca2+-dependent vesicular exocytosis.
  (ii) Exocytosis is dependent on numerous proteins that regulate synaptic vesicle
  availability, traffic, and active zone SNARE complex assembly/disassembly; N-ethylmaleimide
  sensitive factor (NSF; Piccoli et al., ; Belluzzi et al., ), syntaxin 1 (Piccoli
  et al., , ; Islam et al., ), α-syn (Bieri et al., ; MacIsaac et al., ), and snapin
  (Yun et al., ) have been linked to LRRK2, in addition to Rab3 (not shown), which
  colocalizes with α-syn and maybe an LRRK2 substrate (reviewed in Shi et al., ).
  (iii) Classical clathrin-mediated- and bulk-endocytosis both appear important in
  mature synaptic terminals (Clayton and Cousin, ; Clayton et al., ; Gross and von
  Gersdorff, ; Chanaday and Kavalali, ). LRRK2 is implicated in synaptic endocytosis
  via a functional interaction with Endophilin A (Matta et al., ; Ambroso et al.,
  ; Arranz et al., ; Soukup et al., ), synaptojanin (Piccoli et al., ; Islam et al.,
  ; Pan et al., ), auxilin (Nguyen and Krainc, ), and dynamin1 (Piccoli et al., ;
  Stafa et al., ). Early endosome formation, mediated by potential LRRK2 substrate
  Rab5b (Shin et al., ; Yun et al., ), is required for the transport of clathrin-dependent
  endosomes (reviewed in Shi et al., ). (iv) SV trafficking and recycling may involve
  LRRK2 in concert with VPS35 (Inoshita et al., ; Mir et al., ), Rab29 (aka Rab7L1;
  MacLeod et al., ), Rab10, Rab11, and Rab35 (Steger et al., ) which regulate cargo
  and membrane recycling from sorting endosomes back into the cycle or the endolysosomal
  pathway for degradation (reviewed in Taylor and Alessi, ). LRRK2 is also implicated
  in SV storage and mobilization through its phosphorylation/binding of synapsin-I
  (Beccano-Kelly et al., ; Cirnaru et al., ; Carrion et al., ; Marte et al., ; Marku
  et al., ). (B) Cartoon of a generalized postsynaptic structure showing processes
  in which LRRK2 has been implicated, and which are also regulated by numerous Rab
  GTPases (reviewed in Hausser and Schlett, ). While altered neurotransmitter receptor
  (depicted in red) composition and structural plasticity have been observed in mutant
  LRRK2 models (Sweet et al., ; Matikainen-Ankney et al., ), much less is known about
  LRRK2’s physiological role in postsynaptic processes. (i) Neurotransmitter receptors
  are removed from the plasma membrane by clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis
  (reviewed in Anggono and Huganir, ), likely involving LRRK2, Rab4, and Rab5 (Ehlers,
  ). (ii) As at the presynapse, VPS35 (Munsie et al., ), Rab10 (Glodowski et al.,
  ), and Rab11 (Park et al., ) play a role in endosomal sorting and traffic of internalized
  receptors, thereby implicating LRRK2. (iii) LRRK2 may regulate receptor insertion
  into postsynaptic membranes by exocytosis via phosphorylation of NSF (Nishimune
  et al., ; Huang et al., ) and/or Rab8 (Gerges et al., ; Steger et al., ). (iv) LRRK2
  has also been implicated in cell signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics, including
  altered morphology of dendritic spines (Matikainen-Ankney et al., ), functional
  interactions with ERM proteins (not depicted; Parisiadou et al., ) and/or protein
  kinase A (PKA; not depicted), which may additionally affect postsynaptic receptor
  expression in LRRK2 mutants (Muda et al., ; Parisiadou et al., ; Tozzi et al., ).
