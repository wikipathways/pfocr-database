caption: FGF2 functions through FGFR dependent or independent pathways. The binding
  of FGF2 to FGFR induces the formation of FGF2-FGFR-HSPG complex, which leads to
  receptor dimerization and transphosphorylation of tyrosine kinase domains. The major
  FGFR kinase substrate, FRS2α, is phosphorylated by the activated FGFR kinase and
  recruits the adaptor protein, GRB2 and SHP2. This results in subsequent activation
  of MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. In addition, the combination of FGF2 and FGFR also
  activates JAK and PLCγ, the former activates the STAT pathway, the latter hydrolyzes
  PIP2 into IP3 and DAG, and activates Ca2+ and PKC signaling, respectively. As compared
  to extracellular FGF2 signaling, cytosol FGF2 binds to RIG-1 to prevent RIG-1 degradation.
  While in viral infection, the binding of FGF2 with RIG-1 tends to prevent the binding
  of MAVS with RIG-1, and thus inhibit anti-viral innate immunity. (AKT, protein kinase
