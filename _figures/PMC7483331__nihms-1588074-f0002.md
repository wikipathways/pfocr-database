caption: The pathways for LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP autophagy), exosome biogenesis
  and release, and macroautophagy are indicated. The last stage of progression for
  all three pathways can be fusion with lysosomes for degradation of vesicular components.
  For the exosome pathway, the MVB can either be shuttled to the plasma membrane to
  release exosomes or fuse with autophagosome from the autophagy pathway to form amphisomes
  that subsequently fuse with lysosomes. Arrows between the pathways indicate the
  nature of the crosstalk between them, with the red line indicating inhibition and
  black arrows indicating activation or interaction. LC3 protein has been shown to
  negatively regulate exosome release while ATG5 and ATG16L1 proteins show positive
  regulation. CD63 and Alix proteins associated with released exosomes induce autophagy.
  It is not clear at this time whether regulatory cross talk exists between the LAP
  process and exosome biogenesis and release pathways.
