caption: Schematic of the molecular mechanism of the ascorbic acid anticancer effect.
  SDHB-low PCPGs exhibit an imbalance in intracellular iron levels due to abnormal
  activation of the HIF signaling pathway, which further leads to increased vulnerability
  to oxidative stress. Targeting of the ROS synthetic pathway with pharmacologic doses
  of ascorbic acid could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for cluster I PCPGs with
  complex II deficiencies.
