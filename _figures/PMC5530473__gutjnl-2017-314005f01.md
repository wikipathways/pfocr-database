caption: Considering the spectrum of colorectal cancer (CRC)—conventional adenomas
  progress by the sequential accumulation of genetic mutations and chromosomal instability
  causing microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is
  the result of defective DNA repair through inactivation of mismatch repair genes
  and is epitomised by the germline mutation of Mis-Match Repair (MMR) genes seen
  in Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis coli). The sessile serrated neoplasia
  pathway is often initiated by genetic mutation of BRAF or KRAS genes but then progresses
  by methylation of tumour suppressing genes (CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)).
  Both MSS and unstable tumours can result depending on the genes epigenetically silenced
  as the lesions progress. Comparatively, little is known about the traditional serrated
  pathway, but evidence is accumulating that this is a distinct molecular subtype.
  FAP, familial adenomatous polyposis.
