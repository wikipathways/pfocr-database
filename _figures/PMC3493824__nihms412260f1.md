caption: In addition to cytokine neutralization (IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, IL-12/23), direct
  cellular targeting is being used successfully in autoimmune disease. Rituximab targets
  B-cell surface marker CD20 resulting in B cell depletion, whereas belimumab targets
  the BLyS pathway that ultimately affects B cell maturation and survival. With respect
  to T cell effector function, abatacept blocks CD28 co-stimulation with CD80/86 after
  antigen presentation and T cell receptor engagement. In contrast, alefacept (CD2
  antagonism with a LFA-3 fusion protein) and efalizumab (LFA-1/ICAM-1 inhibition)
  decrease T cell activation or migration, respectively.
