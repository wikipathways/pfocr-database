caption: PtNPs change transcriptional networks. (A). Heatmap representing relative
  expression of differentially expressed transcription factors (TFs) in each sample.
  Seven and 29 TFs are enhanced and repressed by PtNPs. (B). KEGG pathway analysis
  conducted with differentially expressed transcription factors shown in the form
  of networks. JUN is identified as a key TF-modulating interconnector for other TFs
  regulating the KEGG pathways. TFs associated with pathways (IL-17 signaling, hormone
  production and secretion, hepatitis B infection, and T-cell differentiation) are
  altered. (C). Network showing interactions between JUN and other differentially
  expressed TFs. Dark-red and dark-blue nodes represent transcription factors with
  relatively higher and lower expression levels, respectively. Edge thickness represents
  the relative number of research references. (D). IGV genome browser images of expression
  level of JUN gene.
