caption: 'Metabolic Shifts in Phenolic Metabolism as a Result of a Mutation in the
  Lignin Biosynthetic Pathway.The relative increase and decrease of transcript and
  metabolite abundances in each of the mutants compared with WT24cm was mapped manually
  on the pathway as discrete features. Differences in metabolites are indicated via
  round-angled boxes, where red represents a significant increase and blue a significant
  decrease in abundance. Differences in transcript abundance are indicated with right-angled,
  framed boxes: significant increases and decreases are visualized via red and blue
  boxes with solid borders, respectively, whereas tendencies [log2(abundance in the
  sample/abundance in WT24cm)<−0.3 or >0.3] are visualized via boxes with a pale fill
  and dashed-line borders. Metabolites that were below detection limit are given in
  gray. The effects in the ccr1 and comt mutants are in (A) and (B), as indicated.
  The metabolic shifts in phenolic metabolism of pal1, pal2, c4h, 4cl1, 4cl2, ccoaomt1,
  f5h1, cad6, and the wild-type developmental stages are given in Supplemental Figure
  5 online. For abbreviations, see .'
