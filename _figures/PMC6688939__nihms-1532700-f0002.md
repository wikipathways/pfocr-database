caption: 'C21 inhibitor protein inhibits the kallikrein-kininogen pathway in multiple
  places as shown leading to decreased generation of bradykinin. However, patients
  with HAE are missing or have dysfunctional C1 inhibitor protein. FDA approved therapies
  for patients with HAE are shown in blue. Investigational therapies for patients
  with HAE are shown in yellow. Each of these therapies leads to decreased bradykinin
  generation by impacting the kallikrein-kininogen pathway as shown. Investigational
  therapies include CSL312, which is a recombinant fully human monoclonal antibody
  that blocks Factor XIIa, ADVM-53, which is a gene therapy aimed at correcting the
  C1-inhibitor deficiency, BCX7353, KVD900 and ATN249 which are oral kallikrein inhibitors,
  PKKRx which is an anti-sense oligonucleotide to reduce the production of prekallikrein,
  and PHA121 which is an oral bradykinin receptor antagonist.Abbreviations: HAE: hereditary
  angioedema; FDA: food and drug administration; PKK: prekallikrein'
