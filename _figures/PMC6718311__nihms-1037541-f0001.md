caption: '(A) MAPKs are activated by an evolutionary conserved signaling pathway that
  is initiated by a MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK), which phosphorylates and activates
  a MAPK kinase (MKK), which then phosphorylates and activates the MAPK (e.g. JNKs).
  Two MKKs are involved in JNKs activation: MKK4/MEK4/SEK1 and MKK7/MEK7. Among the
  14 MKKKs known to activate MKK4/MKK7, members of the mixed-lineage kinase proteins
  (e.g. DLK, MLK2, MLK3) play a crucial role in neuronal cell death. Components of
  this pathway are integrated within scaffold proteins which coordinate their activation
  and subcellular distribution. Particularly, JNKs are activated within scaffold proteins
  of the JNK-interacting protein (JIP) family which include JIP1, JIP2, and JIP3 (JSAP1/Syd).
  Both JIP1 and JIP3 have been associated with JNKs activation in the context of neuronal
  death. JNKs, particularly JNK3 isoforms, activate the intrinsic pathway through
  direct phosphorylation of pro-and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members or through
  phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun which induces BH3-only proteins transcription.(B)
  neuronal JNK signaling pathway is restricted by (1) antagonism of JIP by Akt/PKB,
  (2) Phr1/ Mycbp2-mediated proteasomal degradation of DLK and (3) dephosphorylation
  of JNKs by the DUSP (dual specificity phosphatases) / MKP (MAPK phosphatases) DUSP1
  and DUSP16.'
