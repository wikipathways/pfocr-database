caption: Amino acid limitation causes a decrease in mTOR signaling which leads primarily
  to an increase in IGFBP-1 secretion. A concurrent induction in the AAR pathway signals
  an increase in IGFBP-1 secretion and phosphorylation, potentially through CK2, to
  regulate IGF-I bioavailability and decreased downstream fetal growth.
