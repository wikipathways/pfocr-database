caption: Comparison of gene expression changes in human bladder cancer and our mouse
  model based on KEGG pathway analysis. The information derived from the gene expression
  analysis of the transformed bladder cell lines has been superimposed onto the human
  KEGG pathway display. Red border, genes upregulated in human; green border, genes
  downregulated. Pink boxes, genes upregulated in mouse; green boxes, genes downregulated
  in mouse. No shading, no change in expression of this gene in mouse; gray shading,
  gene was not on the array. The majority of genes deregulated in human bladder cancer
  is also deregulated in the mouse model for bladder cancer (Myc, Mdm2, Ccnd1, Cdkn2a/b,
  Rb1, etc.) and followed the same directionality as the human genes.
