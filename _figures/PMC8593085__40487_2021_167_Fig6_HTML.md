caption: Schematic depicting activation of cGAS/STING pathway by PARP inhibition,
  leading to downstream type 1 interferon production resulting in a direct immunosuppressive
  effect by the cancer cell, as well as increased natural killer (NK) cell and CD8
  cytotoxic T cell activity causing direct anti-tumour killing. IFN interferon, TBK-1
  tank-binding kinase 1, interferon regulatory factor 3, APC antigen-presenting cell
