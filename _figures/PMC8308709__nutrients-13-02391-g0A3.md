caption: Schematic diagram of the HICA pretreatment effects on myotube atrophy under
  cachexic conditions. TNFα/IFNγ co-exposure increases NF-κB and STAT3 phosphorylation
  and, thus, accelerates the translocation of these molecules to the nucleus, resulting
  in the increasing transcription of their targets. Acute inflammatory proteins such
  as iNOS, IL-6, and atrogin-1 are increased directly or indirectly by NF-κB and STAT3
  activation. These acute inflammatory proteins cause decreases of protein synthesis
  and increases of protein breakdown via the ubiquitin–proteasome system. As a result,
  the net balance of protein anabolism and catabolism becomes negative, leading to
  myotube atrophy. Moreover, iNOS overexpression should produce enough NO to enhance
  the oxidative stress. The HICA pretreatment cannot attenuate the NF-κB and STAT3
  phosphorylation induced by cytokine exposure, although it activates the AMPK pathway.
  However, the HICA effect, which involves low basal protein synthesis via the inactivation
  of ERK signaling and activation of p38 MAPK and AMPK signaling should inhibit the
  translation of acute inflammatory proteins from their mRNA. Additionally, the HICA
  pretreated myotubes may experience resistance to stress via activation of the p38MAPK
  pathway, leading to a resistance to NO-induced oxidative stress. As a result, myotube
  atrophy induced by HICA pretreatment under the cachexia condition is caused via
  a mechanism that does not involve a direct impact on the NF-κB and/or STAT3 pathways.
