caption: 'Cell populations involved in the sleep and arousal systems. The ventrolateral
  preoptic nucleus (VLPO), located in the hypothalamic area, releases γ-aminobutyric
  acid (GABA) and galanin (Gal) to promote drowsiness. This field also innervates
  one-third of all arousal pathways. A: The first arousal pathway is the cholinergic
  pathway, in which cholinergic cell populations located in the pedunculopontine tegmentum
  (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) of the pons provide most of the input to
  the reticular nuclei of the thalamus. Indeed, the paraventricular nucleus of the
  thalamus, which originates from the reticular formation, is densely innervated by
  orexin (ORX) fibers. B: The monoaminergic pathway integrates inputs from monoaminergic
  cells, including noradrenaline (NA) from the locus coeruleus (LC), serotonin from
  the raphe nucleus (Raphe), histamine (His) from the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN),
  and the dopamine (DA) from periaqueductal gray (vPAG). The relay projects to the
  lateral hypothalamus (LH) to coordinate a homeostatic response while also receiving
  ORX and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) from the LH and basal forebrain (BF)
  neurons, which contain GABA and acetylcholine (ACh). C: The third arousal system
  consists of glutaminergic neurons and hypocretin neurons or ORX. Starting from the
  VLPO, these neurons extend to all monoaminergic populations from the second pathway
  to stimulate the release of neurotransmitters. This contributes to the flip-flop
  switch model, which highlights the role of ORX in inhibiting the VLPO and thereby
  relieving the inhibition of monoaminergic cells.'
