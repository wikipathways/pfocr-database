caption: The occurrence and regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in a cell. Ferroptosis
  inducers such as erastin, sorafenib and sulfasalazine inhibit SLC7A11 insystemXc−
  andimpede the uptake of cystine by cells, thus leading to a decline in intracellular
  cysteine and a subsequent reduction in glutathione (GSH), which requires cysteine
  for its synthesis; this ultimately results in declination of anti‐oxidative ability
  of cells. Through the sulphur‐transfer pathways, cellular methionine can be used
  to supplement the cysteine level. As a key component in ferroptosis, GPx4 can bind
  with GSH and suppress cellular lipid peroxides to prevent cellular ferroptosis.
  Class 2 ferroptosis inducers such as RSL3 can directly suppress GPx4 to induce ferroptosis.
  The MVA pathway plays an important role in regulating GPx4 maturation. Iron, which
  is indispensable to ferroptosis, can be transported from outside to the inside of
  the cells by transferrin. Ironchelators can impede ferroptosis. Mitochondria are
  the most important organelle involved in ferroptosis; they contain six ferroptosis‐related
  genes and release ferroptosis‐inducing lipid peroxides through the electron transport
  chain. In addition, a number of intracellular molecules/proteinscan regulate ferroptosis;e.g.
  P53 inhibits SLC7A11 and promotes the production of lipid peroxides. HSPB1 can inhibit
  ferroptosis by impeding the increase in intracellular iron. Some anti‐oxidants,
  such as vitamin E, liproxstain‐1 and ubiquinone (Co Q10), can impede ferroptosis
  by directly suppressing lipid peroxides.
