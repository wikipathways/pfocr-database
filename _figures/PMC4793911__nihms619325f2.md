caption: Major cellular mechanisms controlling contraction in gastrointestinal smooth
  muscle cells. Mechanisms leading to enhanced contraction are depicted in red, and
  pathways linked to decreased contraction are shown in blue. Ca2+ required for excitation–contraction
  coupling can enter cells through VDCC or NSCC. The open probability of VDCC is enhanced
  (circle with + sign) by depolarization caused by opening of NSCC and influx of Na+
  or Ca2+. Openings of VDCC are decreased by a variety of K+ channels expressed by
  SMCs; most inhibitory agonists regulate Ca2+ influx by activating K+ channels. Ca2+
  entry can also be supplemented by release of Ca2+ from IP3 receptor-operated Ca2+
  channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Ca2+ release from sacroplasmic
  reticulum can also occur through ryanodine receptors (not shown). IP3 is synthesized
  by PLCβ in response to agonist binding to G-protein-coupled receptors and coupling
  through Gα q/11. [Ca2+]i binds to calmodulin and activates myosin light chain kinase,
  which phosphorylates MLC20 to facilitate cross-bridge formation. Phosphorylation
  of MLC20 is balanced by the action of MLCP. Dephosphorylation of MLC20 reduces cross-bridge
  cycling and leads to muscle relaxation. Factors that lead to inhibition of MLCP
  increase contraction and, in effect, enhance Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile
  apparatus. The opposite is true for factors that activate MLCP. A pathway that increases
  Ca2+ sensitization (and therefore increases contraction) occurs through binding
  of G-protein-coupled (Gαq/11 or Gα12/13) receptors and regulation of the GDP-GTP
  exchange factor (Rho-GEF), RhoA and activation of Rho kinase. Rho kinase and protein
  kinase C can phosphorylate CPI-17 (at T38), a protein that when phosphorylated inhibits
  the catalytic subunit of MLCP (PPlc; circle with negative sign). Rho kinase can
  also phosphorylate the regulatory subunit of MLCP (MYPT) at T696 and T853. Phosphorylation
  of MYPT decreases the activity of MLCP, preserving phosphorylation of MLC20. ZIPK
  also phosphorylates CPI-17 and MYPT. Cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways decrease
  Ca2+ sensitivity. NO, for example, binds to guanylyl cyclase (composed of GCα and
  GCβ subunits) and generates cGMR cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG),
  which can phosphorylate RhoA and reduce activation of Rho kinase, thus reducing
  Ca2+ sensitization, or it can phosphorylate telokin (S13), which stimulates MLCP
  (circle with + sign). Binding of receptors coupled through Gαs activates adenylate
  cyclase and production of cAMP. PKA can also phosphorylate telokin and increase
  MLCP activity. Abbreviations; [Ca2+]i, cytoplasmic Ca2+; DAG, diacylglycerol; IP3,
