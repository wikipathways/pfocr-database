caption: 'General phenylpropanoid pathway up to cinnamic acid thioesters’ biosynthesis.
  (* engaging step of the pathway). Red-dotted box: alternative pathway for p-coumaric
  acid biosynthesis. Arrow represents one biochemical reaction. PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia-lyase. TPAL, tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase.
  4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA-ligase. Phenylalanine will undergo deamination by the enzyme
  phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (E.C. 4.3.1.24), which generates a molecule of NH3 and
  trans-cinnamic acid. Tyrosine/phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (E.C. 4.3.1.25) can realise
  the same reaction as PAL and can also convert tyrosine into p-coumaric acid. Cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase (E.C. 1.14.14.91) adds a hydroxyl group to the para position of trans-cinnamic
  acid, generating p-coumaric acid. 4-coumarate-CoA-ligase (E.C. 6.2.1.12) uses an
  ATP molecule to convert p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA, releasing an AMP and
  a pyrophosphate molecule'
