caption: Molecular targets and therapeutic interventions in non-small cell lung cancer
  treatment. The depicted schematic provides a concise overview of the key molecular
  targets in NSCLC and the suite of targeted therapies designed to intervene. It encompasses
  a spectrum of inhibitors for pathways such as EGFR, ALK, VEGFR, MET, and RET, as
  well as agents that modulate the KRAS, BRAF, MEK, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascades.
  Featured as well are the CDK4/6 inhibitors, a novel class of drugs that govern cell
  cycle progression. Each therapeutic agent is specified by its target, underscoring
  the targeted approach integral to contemporary NSCLC treatment paradigms
