caption: Metabolic pathway changes of intracellular M. tuberculosis. Detailed representation
  of the changes in selected subnetworks identified with genome-wide reaction pair
  analysis. Metabolites are indicated by circles, and genes are indicated by ovals.
  Red color indicates increase or upregulation (log2 FC ≥ log2 1.5; P value < 0.05),
  and blue color indicates decrease or downregulation (log2 FC ≤−log2 1.5; P value
  of <0.05); all data come from at least three biological replicates. Metabolite profiles
  show the mean fold change values from at least three independent experiments shown
  for infection (blue and red) and control (gray) experiments with 95% confidence
  intervals (t test). The dashed lines correspond to |log2 FC| = log2 1.5. (A) Human
  cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and cholesterol catabolism in M. tuberculosis.
  (B) Decreasing levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and 5-hydroxytryptophan indicate
  potential uptake of these aromatic amino acids by intracellular M. tuberculosis,
  whereas their biosynthesis is downregulated. (C) The methylcitrate cycle feeding
  propanonyl-CoA into central carbon metabolism is transcriptionally activated during
  infection. (D) Decreasing levels of leucine/isoleucine and valine indicate potential
  uptake of these branched-chain amino acids by intracellular M. tuberculosis, whereas
  their biosynthesis is downregulated. The pathway maps are adapted from pathway maps
  in the KEGG Pathway database (), with permission from the publisher.
