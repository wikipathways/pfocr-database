caption: Consequences of lamin B1 accumulation on redox balance, senescence and neurological
  defects. Oxidative stress leads to an increase of levels of lamin B1 through activation
  of p38 MAPK. Our data show an important role for lamin B1 protein in the control
  of oxidative stress, by regulating the ROS levels and improving cell viability.
  In case of persistent oxidative stress (such as in A-T cells), prolonged accumulation
  of lamin B1 levels leads to senescence and/or neurological defects. Indeed, lamin
  B1 can impact on nuclear architecture morphology and senescence, as shown in the
  present report, as well as on myelin gene synthesis as it was reported in .
