caption: A) The microtubular pool of PP2Ac is the target of MID1 activity, leading
  to its proteasomal-dependent degradation upon poly-ubiquitination (Blue circles).
  Since mTOR/Raptor association is dependent on PP2A, the degradation of the latter
  leads to an increased formation of the mTOR/Raptor complex, activating its signalling
  pathway (phosphorylated form, yellow circles). B) MID1 loss-of-function reduces
  PP2Ac degradation, leading to de-phosphorylation and decreased association of mTOR
  and Raptor, causing a drop of active mTORC1 complex formation and signalling. (For
  interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is
