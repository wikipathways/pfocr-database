caption: Summary of altered metabolites and metabolic pathways in this study. The
  metabolome of liver tissue and hepatic exosomes in PCOS between young (YP, left
  green part) and middle age (MP, blue right part) are compared. The common alterations
  of the two age groups are downregulation of glycolysis and TCA cycle, as well as
  upregulation of gluconeogenesis. The major substrates for gluconeogenesis in YP
  and MP hepatic cells are fatty acids and amino acids, respectively (purple boxes).
  In YP hepatic cells, the urea cycle, protein digestion and pyrimidine metabolism
  seem to be upregulated, while the glutathione metabolism seems to be upregulated
  in MP hepatic cells. The arrows indicate up- or down-regulation of metabolites in
  (green) young- or (blue) middle-age groups detected in the liver or exosomes. The
  purple dotted lines indicate the gluconeogenesis pathway in hepatic cells. The red
  dotted lines indicate the processes in which the elevated metabolic products are
  transported into exosomes.
