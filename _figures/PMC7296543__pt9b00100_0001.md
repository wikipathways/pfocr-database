caption: 'The canonical signaling pathway of TLRs. The canonical pathway of TLR signaling
  includes the MyD88-dependent pathway and MyD88-independent pathway. In the MyD88-dependent
  pathway, the binding of TLR ligands causes the attachment of MyD88 to TIR, resulting
  in the phosphorylation of IRAKs and downstream TRAF6 and TAK1 which leads to the
  nuclear translocation of inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1
  as well as the activation of mitogen-associated protein kinases (MAPKs), leading
  to transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. However, the TIR domain of
  TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 directly recruits MyD88 to either activate TRAF6 or TRAF3 which
  leads to IRF7 activation and interferons secretion. The MyD88-independent pathway
  is a major model adopted by TLR3 and TLR4. The recruited TRIF activates TRAF3 and
  its downstream TBK1 and IRF3 to regulate the gene transcription of type I interferons.
  TRIF also activates TRAF6 which is responsible for late stage pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  The final recognition of LPSs to TLR4 is a concerted result of different accessory
  proteins: LBPs, CD14, MD-2. Abbreviations: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MyD88, myeloid
  differentiation primary response protein 88, TIRAP, MyD88 adapter-like protein;
