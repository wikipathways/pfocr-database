caption: Simplified pathway model. At the top, a detail of KEGG non-small cell lung
  cancer pathway is shown. At the bottom, the corresponding digital circuit is shown.
  SOS gene is activated by GRB2 and therefore a buffer gate is used. KRAS and BRAF
  genes are activated by two genes and therefore two OR gates are used. Finally, MEK
  is activated by BRAF and ERK by MEK gene and two buffer gates are used
