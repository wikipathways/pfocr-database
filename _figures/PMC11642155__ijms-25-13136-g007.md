caption: Schematic diagram of results summarized in this paper. The use of 0.2 T–0.4
  T SMF (MMF) improved the bone quality of HLU reloading mice by affecting bone metabolism
  and iron metabolism. Through study of the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation
  of primary BMSCs, it was proved that MMF promoted osteogenic differentiation and
  activated the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, inhibiting adipogenic differentiation.
