caption: 'Schematic depiction of reported effects of mammalian caspases in autophagy-related
  effectors. Central red arrow depicts the activation of caspases during the apoptotic
  cascade for the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway. Following activation of cell-surface
  expressed death receptors and DISC formation, pro-caspase 8 is converted to caspase-8
  in ways which can also involve the ATG16L1-complex, and targeting of pro-caspase-8
  oligomers to the autophagosomal surface by p62. Sequestration of pro-caspase-8 to
  the autophagosome can lead to caspase-8 activation, or downregulation, due to the
  extensive retention of the protease by the autophagosome, and its consequent degradation
  by lysosomal hydrolases upon autolysosome formation (not shown). It remains unclear
  whether pro-caspase-10 is regulated in a similar manner. Initiator caspase-9 is
  activated during the intrinsic pathway by cytochrome-c release from damaged mitochondria
  and the assembly of the apoptosome. The initiator caspases then cleave the pro-forms
  of their effectors, resulting in the upregulation of the executioner caspases -3,
  -6, and -7, altogether leading to the apoptotic dismantling cells. The side arrows
  on each caspase depict its known interactions with ATG targets and other autophagy-related
  proteins. The resulting outcome on autophagy is shown with an ‘X’ over, or a ‘+’
  behind the arrows that indicate the otherwise physiological effect of the autophagic
  protein on the pathway. Alternatively the arrows may point towards other effectors
  and functions which directly impact autophagy. As shown above the same protein can
  be targeted by multiple caspases. (Not shown: Caspase-1 interactions, as it is a
  member of the inflammatory caspase group and associated mostly with the pyroptotic
  rather than the apoptotic response)'
