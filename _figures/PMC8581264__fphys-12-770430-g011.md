caption: Roles of endothelial MLNR and its signal transduction pathway on LGA SMC
  relaxation. Green arrows indicate the signaling pathways in EC and SMC during motilin-
  or acetylcholine-induced relaxation of the dog LGA. Red arrows with flat heads indicate
  the blocking effect of inhibitors on the signaling pathways. The drugs in red indicate
  an inhibitory effect on MLNR signaling pathways, and those in blue indicate no inhibitory
  effect. EC, endothelial cell; LGA, left gastric artery; MLNR, motolin receptor;
  and SMC, smooth muscle cell.
