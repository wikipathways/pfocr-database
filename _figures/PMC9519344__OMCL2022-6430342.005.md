caption: Stress factor-induced UPRmt is blocked and mitochondrial dynamics and biosynthesis
  dysfunction. Under the influence of stress factors, mitochondrial quality control
  can synergize with UPRmt. Hypoxia/ischemia, inflammation and hyperglycemia/hyperlipidemia
  induce mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn leads to the activation of mitochondrial
  fission kinesins MFF/Fis1/Drp1 and the inhibition of the expression of mitochondrial
  fusion proteins OPA1/Mfn1 and Mfn2. This in turn leads to aggravated mitochondrial
  fission and mitochondrial dysfunction. This further leads to PGC1a and NRF1/NRF2-mediated
  mitochondrial biosynthesis impairment, decreased Tfam and mitochondrial transcription
  levels, and disturbance of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
  levels, which may be important pathways of mitochondrial damage. At this time, UPR
  is activated, which may indirectly compensate for mitochondrial biosynthesis dysfunction
  and maintain cardiomyocyte function and cardiac function.
