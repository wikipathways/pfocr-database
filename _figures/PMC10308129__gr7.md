caption: The roles of KLF10 in tumors and many other diseases. KLF10 can increase
  the expression of PTEN to blunt AKT activity, thereby inhibiting multiple myeloma
  (MM) and bladder cancer. In MM, microRNA-410 inhibits the expression of KLF10, which
  can be blocked by lncRNA OIP5-AS1 (see the pathway indicated by orange lines). KLF10
  can also inhibit the activity of Wnt signaling to suppress MM. In bladder cancer,
  the inhibitory effect of miR-197–3p on KLF10 expression can be suppressed by LINC00641
  (see the pathway indicated by green lines). KLF10 may promote DEN-induced liver
  cancer. KDM6A can transactivate the expression of Klf10, and in turn KLF10 can bind
  on KDM6A gene promoter to increase its expression, forming a positive feedback loop.
  Furthermore, KLF10 can recruit Dnmt1 to inhibit the expression of Nephrin and thus
  exacerbates diabetic nephropathy (see the pathway indicated by blue lines). Through
  recruiting HDAC1 to suppress the expression of SNAI2, KLF10 can inhibit TGFβ-induced
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to suppress cancer invasion. By decreasing
  the expression of MCP1, KLF10 can attenuate acute viral myocarditis (VMC). KLF10
  can activate TGFβ/SMAD signaling pathway, and then stimulate the expression of collagen
  Ⅱ, Aggrecan, thereby alleviating intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In osteoarthritis
  (OA), KLF10 can increase the expression of Axvr1 and decrease the expression of
  Inhbb and thus exacerbates OA. KLF10 can protect against cardiac hypertrophy in
  male mice. However, KLF10 may be not good for ameliorating heart infarction. KLF10
  can be beneficial in promoting skin repairment.
