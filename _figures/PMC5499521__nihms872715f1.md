caption: TFH cell differentiation is initiated by activation of CD4 naïve T cells
  by dendritic cells in presence of IL6, IL21 and IL12 leading to STAT3/STAT4 activation.
  Activation of ICOS induces the upregulation of BCL6 and CXCR5, allowing them to
  migrate to B cell follicles to induce germinal centers formation. Stimulation of
  TFH cells and antigen presentation by B cells leads to full development of TFH cells,
  whose mission is supporting B-cells and facilitating the generation of long-lived
  plasma cells and memory B cells. Malignant transformation of TFH leads to the development
  of AITL following a multistep tumor model where TET2 and/or DNMT3A mutations would
  be acquired first, followed by specification into the TFH lineage guided by expression
  of the RHOA G17V mutant and enhanced by hyper activation of the TCR signaling pathway.
  Deregulated expansion and/or function of TFH could induce the generation of cytokines
  (IL4, IL6, IL21 and IL10) which play a prominent role in the early stages of lymphoma
  progression and in setting the abundant inflammatory component of AITL tumor lesions.
