caption: Model of the AMPK/PPARδ pathway inhibits tumor growth. Activated AMPK induced
  PPARδ-S50 phosphorylation, leading to accumulation of misfolded PPARδ and inhibition
  of PPARδ transcription activity and subsequently decreased cancer cell metabolism
  and tumor growth. AMPK, 5′AMP-activated protein kinase; PPARδ, peroxisome proliferator–activated
  receptor δ.
