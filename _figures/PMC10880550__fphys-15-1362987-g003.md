caption: The effects of acetylcholine on smooth muscle cells and ICC-IM via M2/3 receptors.
  GI smooth muscle mainly expresses M2 (80%) and M3 (20%) receptor, and ICC-IM expresses
  M3 receptor. In case of TRPC channels, smooth muscles mainly express TRPC4 and TRPC6.
  Both M2/3 receptor are important for TRPC4 function via Gi and Gq proteins, whereas
  M3 receptor activates TRPC4 and TRPC6 via the Gq-PLC-DAG pathway. M2 receptor alone
  activates TRPC, but in this case, it also works through Gi-AC-cAMP-PKA as well as
  Gi protein itself
