caption: Important role of mTOR related pathway in metabolic reorganization of breast
  cancer. PI3K and Ras regulate Akt and ERK, which in turn induce changes in intermediate
  metabolism to promote anabolic processes. Potential Notch signaling crosstalk with
  other pathways in breast cancer. In addition, they also induce the activation of
  mTORC1, thus further supporting the rewiring of cellular metabolism and anabolic
  metabolism progress. Through various mechanisms Akt, ERK and mTORC1 stimulate aerobic
  glycolysis, lipid synthesis, the pentose phosphate, oxidative phosphorylation, autophagy,
  thus producing the major components necessary for cell growth and proliferation.
  These networks of signaling cascades, their interconnection and regulation allow
  the cells to maintain energetic balance and allow for the physiological adaptation
  to the ever-changing environment.
