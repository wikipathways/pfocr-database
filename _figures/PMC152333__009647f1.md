caption: Scheme of Amide Amino Acid Metabolism (Top), the Asp Family Pathway (Center),
  and the Pathway of Lys Catabolism (Bottom).Dashed arrows with minus signs represent
  end-product feedback inhibition loops. α-AASA, α-amino adipic semialdehyde; AAT,
  Asp aminotransferase; AS, Asn synthase; 3-ASA, 3-aspartic semialdehyde; ASN, asparaginase;
  AK, Asp kinase; CGS; cystathionine γ-synthase; DHPS, dihydrodipicolinate synthase;
  GOGAT, Glu synthase; HSD, homoserine dehydrogenase; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; LKR,
  Lys-ketoglutarate reductase; SDH, saccharopine dehydrogenase. The broken arrow at
  bottom indicates several enzymatic steps leading to the production of acetyl-CoA.
