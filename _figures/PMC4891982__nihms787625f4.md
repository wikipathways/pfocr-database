caption: (a,b) Production of malate M+4 and pyruvate M+3 from [U-13C]glutamine (12
  h labeling) (a) and abundance of pyruvate M+3 relative to malate M+4 (b) in normoxic
  proliferating or differentiating (day 5) 3T3-L1 cells. (c) Associated production
  in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes of M+3–labeled 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), PEP,
  pyruvate (pyr) and lactate (lac). (d) Central carbon metabolic flux in differentiating
  3T3-L1 adipocytes based on metabolic flux analysis informed by nutrient uptake,
  waste excretion and biomass production flux, as well as LC-MS analysis of intracellular
  metabolite labeling in cells fed [U-13C]glucose or [U-13C]glutamine. Shown are relative
  flux values (normalized to glucose uptake) from the best fit flux sets for a simplified
  network with ME1 only (blue), a network with inclusion of mitochondrial enzymes
  ME2 or ME3 (ME1/2/3, red) and constraint of the ME1 flux using 2H-labeling data
  (ME1(constrained)/2/3, purple numbers). Flux values <10% different from the ME1
  only values are not shown. Inset, confidence intervals for malic enzyme and pyruvate
  carboxylase flux. For complete flux distributions and confidence intervals, see
  . GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; glyc, glycerol; OAA, oxaloacetate; αKG, α-ketoglutarate;
  cit, citrate; Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA. ***P < 0.001, t-test; data are mean ± s.d., n
  = 3 (a–c) independent culture dishes analyzed in parallel (similar results were
  obtained on three independent occasions).
