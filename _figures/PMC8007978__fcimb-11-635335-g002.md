caption: Metabolism of macrophages is beneficial to host defense or pathogen survival
  of during Mtb infection. HIF-1α, which is expressed in macrophage infected with
  Mtb, lowers the level of pyruvate by upregulating lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH)
  and producing lactate. Pyruvate is a carbon source for Mtb and is used for proliferation.
  Thus, lowering the pyruvate level is advantageous for host defense. The glycolysis
  induced by Mtb infection limits Mtb survival through IL-1β induction. Elevated glycolytic
  flux and downregulated succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in Mtb-infected macrophages
  triggers succinate accumulation. Succinate exhibits a pro-inflammatory reaction
  by inducing HIF-1α activation and IL-1β production. The pro-inflammatory mitochondrial
  ROS produced by succinate oxidation can limit necroptosis and Mtb replication by
  lowering ROS levels with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) supplements. The
  enzymes participating in the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of
  macrophages infected with Mtb are downregulated. Itaconate inhibits SDH-mediated
  oxidation to increase succinate levels and induce IRG1-mediated anti-inflammatory
  responses. Arginase-1 (Arg1) contributes to the survival of pathogens in the early
  stages of infection, but controls infections during chronic infection. In macrophages,
  IDO-mediated tryptophan depletion induces immune tolerance, whereas inhibition of
  tryptophan synthesis using a specific gene deficiency in Mtb has a synergistic effect
  on Mtb growth inhibition. Macrophages infected with Mtb promote intracellular lipid
  metabolism to promote lipid droplet (LD) formation and differentiation into “foamy”
  macrophages, a characteristic of granulomas. This process is dependent on de novo
  cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (FAS). Autophagy inhibited by the miR-33 locus
  blocks lipid catabolism and promotes cellular lipid accumulation. LD components,
  such as triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol ester (CE), are nutrient sources for
  Mtb. Statins that inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in hosts with chronic Mtb infection
  can be a host-directed drug target. Since the production of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in
  Mtb-infected macrophages induces necrosis and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces apoptosis,
  preferential PGE2synthesis in the host may be an important host-directed therapy
  (HDT) for antimycobacterial responses. The blue pathway should be enhanced, and
  the red pathway weakened in favor of the host. In the immune metabolism of host
  cells infected by Mtb, increased expression and activity are green, and decreased
  expression and activity are purple.
