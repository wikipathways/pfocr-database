caption: Hypothetical model for HVA1 response under drought and heat stress. Under
  drought stress conditions, HVA1, by interacting with another unknown transcription
  factor, leads to the transcription of genes such as NAC, DREB, and Rab. These transcription
  factors further activate Dehydrin and other drought-responsive genes, which help
  in acquiring drought stress tolerance in plants. In the case of heat stress conditions,
  HVA1 activates HsfA6 and ABI19 via the ABA-mediated pathway. HsfA6 then leads to
  the expression of HSPs, which play a major role in providing protection against
  heat stress.
