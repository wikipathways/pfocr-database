caption: The N-terminus of PAR1 is cleaved by the protease thrombin exposing a new
  N-terminal domain that functions as tethered ligand that interacts intramolecularly
  with the receptor. Activated PAR1 is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated by an unknown
  E3 ubiquitin ligase at the plasma membrane and/or possibly on endosomes. The ubiquitin
  moiety is not required for sorting into the degradative pathway and may be removed
  by an unknown DUB. Sorting into the degradative pathway occurs by the sequential
  action of AP-3 and ALIX, both of which interact directly with discrete linear peptide
  tyrosine-based motifs within the C-tail. Entry into ILVs also requires the action
  of ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4. The function of ubiquitin moieties on PAR1 remains to
  be determined.
