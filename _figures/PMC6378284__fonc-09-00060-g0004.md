caption: A schematic illustration of YAP/TAZ regulation of TE and ICM specification
  in preimplantation embryo. During preimplantation, the outer blastomeres of the
  embryo form an outer epithelial trophoectoderm (TE) that envelopes the remaining
  blastomere and the inner cell mass (ICM). The Hippo pathway plays a crucial role
  in the cell fate determination. In the outer cells, nuclear YAP and TEAD4 regulate
  specification of the TE lineage through activation of the TE-specific genes such
  as Cdx2 and Gata3. In the inner cells, cell-cell adhesions influence the Hippo signaling.
  Activated Hippo pathway impairs YAP nuclear localization in the ICM lineage, thereby
  limiting TEAD4 transcription and abrogating the expression of outer TE-specific
  genes.
