caption: Diagram showing the effects of knockout or blockade of specific elements
  of the alternative, classical and lectin pathways of complement activation on the
  pathogenesis of anti-MPO induced murine crescentic glomerulonephritis. Note that
  disruption of the alternative pathway, and blockade of C5 and C5aR inhibits disease;
  but not disruption of the classical or lectin pathways, depletion of C6 or blockade
  of C3aR (shown only in vitro). This figure is based on data reported in references
  14, 16, 17 and 20.
