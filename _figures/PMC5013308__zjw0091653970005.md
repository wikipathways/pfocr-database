caption: Pathway map of quantitative comparisons of metabolic proteins in RKO cell
  lines. Pairwise comparisons of metabolic PRM measurements of A, RKO Mut versus RKO
  WT and B, RKO Par versus RKO WT. Peptides with the lowest CV and largest normalized
  peak area were used for quantitative comparisons, and normalized peak area for all
  detected peptides are shown in supplemental Fig. S4. The legend for each pairwise
  comparison shows fold changes relative to the cell line listed first in each comparison.
  Proteins with a CV < 0.25, an ICC > 0.6, and a p < 0.05 and that are higher in the
  first cell line are shown in red (at least a twofold difference) or light red (between
  1.2- and 1.9-fold difference). Proteins with a CV < 0.25, an ICC > 0.6, and a p
  < 0.05 and that are lower in the first cell line are shown in green (at least a
  2-fold difference) or light green (between 1.2- and 1.9-fold difference). Proteins
  with a CV < 0.25, an ICC > 0.6, but a p > 0.05 or with a CV < 0.25 but an ICC <
  0.6 are listed in gray (no difference). Proteins with a CV > 0.25 or with no detectable
  peak area are shown in white.
