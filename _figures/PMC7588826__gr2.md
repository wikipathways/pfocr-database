caption: Quality control of secretory and membrane protein targeting. (a) NAC competes
  with SRP for binding to the large ribosomal subunit, preventing nonspecific interactions
  with ER translocons. NAC also acts to prevent cytosolic aggregation independent
  of its role on the ribosome. (b) Mitochondrial membrane proteins that have been
  incorrectly targeted to the ER are recognised by the ER-SURF pathway and redirected
  to mitochondria. Failed mitochondrial targeting can also lead directly to degradation
  as detailed in Ref. []. (c) Integral membrane proteins subject to quality control
  in the mitochondria are extracted by Msp1, before being transferred to the ER and
  being targeted for degradation by Doa10/Cdc48. (d) If excess or aberrant substrates
  reach the translocons of the outer mitochondrial membrane they can cause a clog.
  This clog is resolved by the actions of Msp1 and the adaptor protein Cis1, as part
  of the mitochondrial stress response termed ‘MitoCPR’. The declogger Ste24 performs
  a similar function at the ER.
