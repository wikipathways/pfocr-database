caption: Naïve T cells rely on oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) and maintain robust mitochondrial
  quality control. After activation with co-stimulation through receptors including
  CD28 that activate the mTORC1 pathway, effector T cells increase glucose and glutamine
  (Gln) metabolism to support effector function. If antigen is cleared, effector cells
  can enter a long-lived memory state with stem cell-like properties. If antigen remains,
  as often occurs in long-term tumor elimination processes, inhibitory receptors such
  as PD-1 and CTLA4 can reshape T cell metabolism to reduce pathways that characterize
  effector T cells and lead to multiple metabolic impairments. Exhausted T cells demonstrate
  reduced glucose and glutamine metabolism, low quality dysfunctional mitochondrial,
  and a dependance on fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Potentially contributing to T cell
  disfunction in the tumor microenvironment are low levels of oxygen (pO2), low levels
  of tryptophan (Trp) metabolized by the kynurenine pathway including indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), low levels of arginine (Arg) metabolized by arginase (ARG1),
  high levels of lactate, and potentially competition for glucose with cancer cells.
