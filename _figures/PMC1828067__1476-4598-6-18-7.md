caption: A schematic representation of osteopontin/αvβ3 signaling in the regulation
  of prostate cancer cell migration. PC3 cells bind osteopontin through integrin αvβ3
  in an RGD-dependent manner. Integrin αvβ3 increases Rho GTPase activity through
  down stream signaling pathway that involves RANKL [62] or tyrosine phosphorylation
  of several signaling molecules such as Src, PYK2, FAK, and p130Cas associated with
  integrin [10,64]. Rho activation increases CD44 surface expression [10,32] that
  resulted in the activation of MMP-9. The interaction of CD44 with MMP-9 on the cell
  surface may have a role in the degradation of ECM to facilitate cell migration.
  Bisphosphonates (BPs) inhibit CD44 surface interaction with MMP-9 either partially
  or completely. The signaling pathway and the target molecules that exhibit the inhibitory
  effects of BP treatment are indicated by dotted arrows and 'X'. A decrease (indicated
  by inverted red arrow) in CD44 surface expression, MMP-9 interaction with CD44 on
  the cell surface, MMP-9 secretion, and cell migration was observed in cells treated
  with BP. PC3/OPN cells treated with BPs reproduce the changes observed in PC3/SiRNA
  and PC3/OPN (RGA) The possible reason for these effects may be due to reduced αvβ3
  -signaling in PC3/OPN (RGA) and PC3/SiRNA cells or targeting of αvβ3-signaling pathway
  by BPs.
