caption: Mechanism of small RNA (sRNA) regulation in plant responses to heat stress.
  Heat stress signaling can be perceived by putative sensors on the cell membrane,
  which induce the expression of heat stress responsive genes. HSFA1s function as
  master regulators to active the downstream heat stress responsive transcription
  factors and genes. Heat-induced miR398 downregulates CSDs and CCS. Accumulation
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cells acts as signals to alter the expression
  of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs), and miR319 functions in this pathway
  via unknown targets. HSFA1s directly activate the expression of HTT genes, targets
  of TAS1, which upregulate HSF and heat shock protein (HSP) genes. The miR156-SPL
  module promotes sustained expression of heat stress-inducible genes in response
  to recurring heat stress and prolong the heat stress memory. In addition, the retrotransposition
  ONSEN is activated by HSFAs, although, siRNAs regulate its activity, which can be
  inherited to its progeny. miR159-GAMYB modules function in gibberellin (GA) signaling.
  miR160, miR167, miR390, and miR393 target AUXIN RESPONSIVE FACTOR (ARF) or TAARs
  that act in the auxin response pathway and show morphological adaptations under
  heat stress. Arrowed lines represent promotional effects and flat lines represent
  repressive effects. Dashed lines indicate hypotheses that need to be confirmed.
