caption: Potential methods to inhibit inflammation in COVID‐19 patients. Infection
  with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) activates cytokine
  signaling and induces inflammation and cytokine storms. Colchicine, tocilizumab,
  siltuximab, anakinra, canakinumab, and baricitinib can inhibit the transduction
  of cytokine signaling in different ways. Colchicine inhibits the production of interleukin‐1β
  (IL‐1β). Tocilizumab binds to the interleukin 6 receptor (IL‐6R) to prevent the
  function of IL‐6. Siltuximab acts by targeting IL‐6. Anakinra targets IL‐1R to inhibit
  inflammation. Canakinumab is an anti‐IL‐1β antibody that can block transduction.
  Baricitinib inhibits the JAK/STAT pathway, which mediates cytokine signaling. Furthermore,
  baricitinib interacts with adaptor‐associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) to inhibit
  the entry of SARS‐CoV‐2.
