caption: Notch/SKP2/CDK pathway model. (A) In basal conditions, mitogen stimulation
  promotes reentry into the cell cycle by inducing SKP2 expression, which in turn,
  mediates p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 degradation. (B) Activation of Notch by its physiologic
  ligands synergies with mitogen stimulation and enforces SKP2 transcription, leading
  to increased degradation of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 and to enhanced G1-S transition.
