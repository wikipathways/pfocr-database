caption: WNT ligand is palmitoylated by Porcupine (PORCN) in the endoplasmic reticulum,
  and transported to the plasma membrane via Wntless (WLS). Once secreted and binds
  receptors FZD and LRP5/6 and this interaction recruits AXIN to the cell membrane
  and destabilizes the destruction complex, composed of APC, AXIN1, CK1, and GSK3β.
  Reduced β-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3β and CK1 decreases protein turnover, enabling
  it to translocate into the nucleus, where it can associate with co-activators and
  promote the transcription of a plethora of target genes, including MYC, CCND1, FZD,
  AXIN2. The secreted ligand, RSPO, forms complex with LGR4/5/6 and RNF43, preventing
  RNF43-dependent degradation of FZD receptors, and potentiating WNT signaling. In
  the absence of WNT or RSPO ligand, the destruction complex efficiently phosphorylates
  β-catenin, tagging it for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Red boxes indicate
  various nodes of existing small molecule inhibitors designed for WNT-targeted therapies.
