caption: Photobiological H2 production by heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. Vegetative
  cells of cyanobacteria produce carbohydrates (CH2O) by oxygenic photosynthesis (the
  Calvin cycle). Under nitrogen-limited conditions, a subset of cells forms developmentally
  specialized heterocysts that do not produce O2 because they lack photosystem II
  activity. Heterocysts are surrounded by peptidoglycan, glycolipid, and polysaccharide
  layers, which restrict the entry of O2, and a small amount of O2 that diffuses into
  heterocysts is removed by respiration; thus, the inside of heterocysts is kept microoxic.
  The microoxic environment protects the O2-labile nitrogenase from inactivation by
  O2, and the enzyme is utilized for the unidirectional H2 production. Electrons required
  for nitrogenase reaction depend on sucrose provided by vegetative cells. Sucrose
  is degraded by the metabolic pathway involving the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway
  (OPPP), generating NADPH used for the reduction of ferredoxin (Fd) by photosystem
  I (PSI) and for the formation of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is also formed
  by photophosphorylation involving photosynthetic electron transport system and PSI.
  In wild-type cells, H2 produced is absorbed by the Hup. By inactivating the gene
  encoding Hup, the mutant cells can accumulate H2 even in the presence of O2 produced
  by photosynthesis. By creating selective mutations in the gene encoding nitrogenase,
  the mutated nitrogenases direct the electron flux through the enzyme selectively
  toward proton reduction in the presence of N2

    Vegetative cells of cyanobacteria produce carbohydrates (CH2O) by oxygenic photosynthesis
