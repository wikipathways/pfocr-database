caption: Oncolytic mechanism of Herpes Simplex Virus. Viral RNA activates the double-stranded-RNA-
  (dsRNA-) dependent protein kinase (PKR) by phosphorylation, which causes eIF2α phosphorylation
  and inhibition of translation of the viral genes. HSV Υ-34.5 gene encodes the ICP34.5
  protein that acts to dephosphorylate eIF2α allowing protein synthesis to continue.
  In many cancer cells with activated Ras, PKR is not phosphorylated. Deletion of
  the Υ-34.5 gene from HSV results in attenuation of viral replication in normal cells
  but allows a lytic infection in cancer cells that have defects in this signaling
  pathway.
