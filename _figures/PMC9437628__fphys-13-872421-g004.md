caption: (A) Betweenness Centrality of TNF-α mediated sphingomyelin signaling pathway-
  Betweenness Centrality of a node represents the number of shortest paths between
  other pair of nodes that pass through that node. In this figure, the betweenness
  centralities of the pathway entities are represented by the color and size of the
  nodes, varying from dark wine to amber yellow and large to small, respectively.
  Nodes with dark wine color and large size have high betweenness centrality, whereas
  nodes with light golden color and small size have low betweenness centrality. Color
  of intermediate nodes vary from punch pink to amber. (B) Closeness Centrality of
  TNF-α mediated sphingomyelin signaling pathway- Closeness Centrality of nodes determines
  their average distance to all other nodes. The closeness centralities of the pathway
  entities are represented by the color and size of the nodes, varying from dark blue
  to yellow and large to small respectively. Dark blue nodes with large sizes have
  high closeness centrality, whereas yellow color nodes having small sizes have low
  betweenness centrality. Color of intermediate nodes vary from pine green to light
  green.
