caption: 'Modification of PtdIns Mediated by PI3K, PTEN, SHIP, INPP4 and the PI3K
  signaling pathway in cancer: The phosphorylated state of inositol lipids inserted
  in the cell membrane is controlled by inositol kinase and phosphatase enzymes. As
  proposed in “The Two PIP hypothesis” [], the presence of both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2
  at the membrane triggers downstream signaling events that more effectively promote
  cancer cell survival. Downstream targets of AKT are both pro-survival (activation
  of mTORC1, RAF) and anti-apoptotic (inhibition of GSK-3, FOXO) permitting increased
  cancer cell survival and proliferation.'
