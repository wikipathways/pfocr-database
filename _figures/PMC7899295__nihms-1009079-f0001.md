caption: A positive feedback loop connects WNT and telomere capping. In normal healthy
  cells, telomeres have sufficient length and shelterin occupancy to ensure the capped
  state, which in turn supports normal expression of WNT pathway components. This
  positive feedback loop is highlighted by the shaded box. As telomeres shorten, they
  begin to uncap, activating DNA damage responses (DDRs). The DDR upregulates miR-34a,
  which has many targets including WNT pathway factors, leading to the downregulation
  of WNT pathway factors and target genes, including those expressing the shelterins
  TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, and POT1. Thus, the normal mutual support between WNT signaling
  and telomere capping is lost. Reactivating the WNT pathway using agonists such as
  GSK-3 inhibitors upregulates shelterins, which promote telomere capping, thus restoring
  the beneficial feedback. Furthermore, in cells that can express some telomerase
  (e.g., normal, but also DKC1 mutant, epithelial stem cells), upregulation of TERT
  by WNT (top pathway) can elevate telomerase activity, thus lengthening telomeres
  and further promoting capping.
