caption: Mechanism between FABP4 and several cancers in obesity. There are some findings
  about the mechanism. Circulating FABP4 functions as a tumor promoting factor obesity-associated
  breast cancer through the IL-6/STAT3/ALDH1 pathway. FABP4 could additionally activate
  the PI3K/AKT pathway participating in the tumor growth and survival, such as prostate
  cancer. The rise of FABP4 leads to a series of metabolic changes in cells, resulting
  in a significant reduction of miR-409-3p expression, which promotes the occurrence
  and development of ovarian cancer. Moreover, FABP4 could stimulate the proliferation
  and migration of HCC cells, promoting liver cancer progression.
