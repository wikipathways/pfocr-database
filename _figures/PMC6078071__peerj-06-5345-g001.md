caption: C5 pathway for the heme biosynthesis is shaded in yellow. In this study,
  we regard the steps converting protoporphyrin IX to Chl a as the “Chl a biosynthetic
  pathway,” and shaded in green. The non-mevalonate pathway is shaded in blue. The
  first two pathways belong to “Porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism” (map00860),
  while the third pathway belongs to “Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis” (map00900)
  in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG pathway, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).
  Enzymes involved in the three pathways, as well as their gene names and corresponding
  KOIDs, are shown in red.
