caption: Salt sensing in mammalian cells.The SIK1 pathway is depicted with its presently
  known signaling components. Increases in Na+ permeability (from basal = ~9 to ~14 mM,
  []) promote transient increases in intracellular Ca2+ via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.
  Sequential activation of calmodulin, calmodulin kinase 1 (CaMK1), and salt-inducible
  kinase 1 (SIK1) leads to phosphorylation of a phosphomethylesterase 1 (PME-1), promoting
  its dissociation from the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is then activated.
  Dephosphorylation of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit (NK-inactive) triggers the increase
  in its catalytic activity (NK-active)
