caption: 'The top portion represents the segregation of acute activity in POMC and
  NPY/AgRP cells. Each receptor type is dedicated by a color to represent receptor
  expression and is shown on the bottom left hand side of the figure. The signaling
  pathway of each receptor type is then shown by arrow movement. In POMC neurons,
  Leptin and Adiponectin act through Phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathway leading
  to activation of a putative transient receptor protein 5 (TRPC5) channel. Serotonin
  acts via Phospholipase C and TRPC5. Insulin acts through PI3K as well but ultimately
  targets an ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP). In AgRP cells, Adiponectin,
  Leptin, and Insulin act through a PI3K-KATP dependent mechanism. Ghrelin acts through
  a mixed cation channel. Adiponectin Receptors (AdipoR); Ghrelin Receptors (GhsR);
  Glucagon-like peptide Receptors (GLP-1r); Insulin Receptors (InsR); Leptin Receptors
  (LepR); Serotonin 2C Receptors (5-HT2cR). The bottom portion of the figure shows
  cell subtypes based on transcriptional profiling data in Campbell et al. []. Neuron
  clusters are named after the specified gene. POMC has three subtypes: n14.Ttr, n15.Anxa2,
  and n21.Glipr1; AgRP has 2 subtypes: n12.Sst and n13.Gm8773. The size of each partition,
  although not to scale, is meant to represent the expression value of each specified
  receptor in relation to the other subtypes of the cell (POMC or NPY/AgRP).'
