caption: Signaling network connecting Rheb and AMPK. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is
  mainly involved in cell proliferation and the Ras/PI3K/Akt/TSC pathway in survival
  and cell growth. However, by activating ERK/RSK1 or Akt, both pathways converge
  to inhibit the TSC1/2 complex. Similarly, high ATP:AMP ratios inhibit AMPK, which
  may also lead to the inactivation of TSC1/2 and thus activation of Rheb/mTORC1 and
  consequently the translation of mRNAs important for cell growth. Despite its tumor-suppressive
  roles, AMPK increases the cytoplasmic levels of p27, thereby potentially promoting
  cell migration and/or autophagy. Our findings indicate that in normal cells Rheb
  can negatively regulate its activity by activating AMPK (red arrow) independently
  of mTORC1.
