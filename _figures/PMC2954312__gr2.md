caption: Crosstalk between the three distinct oscillators that function in the mouse
  PSM.(a) Schematic diagram of a signalling and a responding cell in the mouse PSM,
  detailing cyclic genes of the Notch, Fgf and Wnt pathways. Notch and Fgf-regulated
  cyclic genes oscillate asynchronously to cyclic genes of the Wnt pathway . A large
  number of the cyclic genes are involved in negative feedback loops . The very basic
  circuitry of the three signalling pathways is represented here. N.B. Hes7 expression
  is Fgf-dependent in the caudal PSM only. Hashed line represents interactions that
  to date have only been shown in tissues outside of the PSM . (b) The crosstalk indicated
  between the three pathways in this part of the figure are interactions that have
  been demonstrated specifically within the PSM largely through the analysis of mouse
  mutants and some pharmacological studies . As such, it is not clear if these interactions
  are direct. These analyses rely on analysis of mRNA expression of the various pathway
  components as indicated by italicised gene names. The interactions are colour coded
  such that regulation of the Wnt or Fgf pathway components by the Notch pathway are
  indicated in pink, input from the Wnt signalling pathway to the regulation of Notch
  or Fgf components are in blue. Regulation of the Notch or Wnt pathway components
  by the Fgf pathway is indicated in green. Dll1, Delta-like 1; DACT1, dapper homologue
