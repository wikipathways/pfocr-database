caption: 'Mechanisms of immune exclusion through Wnt/beta-catenin pathway: Activation
  of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in tumor leads to noninflammatory milieu through multiple
  mechanisms. a By acting on Batf3-lineage CD103+ dendritic cells, decreasing CCL4
  production by inducing the gene expression of the transcription repressor ATF3.
  This in turn reduces CD8+ T cell priming and infiltration. b By interacting with
  tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) through Snail (a soluble factor product of a
  Wnt-regulated gene) which can in turn increase beta-catenin activity by IL-1β. c
  β-catenin can enhance Treg survival through unknown mechanisms'
