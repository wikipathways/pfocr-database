caption: 'The carbon-sulfur and carbon-amine bonds modification podophyllum compounds
  showed that the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways were activated
  by the carbon-sulfur bond modified aromatic heterocyclic podophyllum derivatives.
  Only the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was activated by the carbon-amine bond
  modified aromatic heterocyclic podophyllum derivatives. Symbols: the pathways were
  activated by Compound 4β-S-(1, 3, 4-trizole-2)-4-deoxy-podophyllotoxin (Compound
  1S) (); the pathways were activated Compound 4β-NH-(1, 3, 4-trizole-2)-4-deoxy-podophyllotoxin
  (Compound 1N) ().'
