caption: Resistance-associated BTK (C481) mutation and possibilities of its overcoming
  in ibrutinib-treated CLL patients. (A) After the occurrence of BTK (C481) mutation,
  ibrutinib does not bind to BTK causing the loss of its therapeutic effect leading
  to BCR and NF-kB pathway activation, both signaling pathways pivotal for maintenance
  and proliferation of CLL cells. Additionally, activating mutations in PLCG2 gene
  may result in continuous BCR signaling independently on BTK activation. To overcome
  the resistance by mutations in BTK/PLCG2 genes, other pathways may be targeted.
  (B) Idelalisib targets phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), resulting in the downregulation
  of PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, irrespectively on the BTK mutation status. (C) Venetoclax
  targets BCL-2, thus leading to the apoptosis of CLL cells. As the previous treatment
  with BCR inhibitors results in an increased dependence on BCL-2 expression together
  with the fact that venetoclax complements ibrutinib-mediated apoptosis, a deep therapeutic
  effect on venetoclax is achieved.
