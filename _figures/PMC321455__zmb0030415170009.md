caption: A model depicting the relationship between the p19Arf-p53 tumor suppressor
  pathway and the Rho GTPase signaling module in the regulation of cell proliferation
  and transformation. In addition to malfunction in checkpoint and apoptosis control,
  deficiency of p19Arfand/or p53 may alter transcriptional balance and promote cell
  growth by upregulating PI 3-kinase and Rho GTPase activities. Mitogenic signals
  that cause activation of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 could further modulate cell cycle
  and apoptotic machineries and cooperate with p53 deficiency to promote cell hyperproliferation
  and transformation.
