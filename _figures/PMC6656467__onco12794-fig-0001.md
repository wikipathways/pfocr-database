caption: 'BRAF mutations in the context of mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  molecular alterations. (A): BRAF is an integral component of the intracellular MAPK
  pathway. (B): BRAF V600E mutations encode for a constitutively active BRAF protein,
  leading to overactive MAPK pathway signaling, aberrant proliferation, and cell growth,
  which can drive cancer initiation and progression. (C): In cells that do not harbor
  a BRAF mutation, BRAF inhibitors can lead to paradoxical hyperactivation of BRAF,
  leading to enhanced MAPK signaling and increased cellular proliferation. (D): However,
  mutant BRAF‐specific inhibitors, such as dabrafenib, provide antitumor activity
  in BRAF V600‐mutant tumors by mitigating hyperactive signaling.'
