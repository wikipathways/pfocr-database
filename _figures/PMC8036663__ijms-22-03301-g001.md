caption: 'Glioblastoma (GBM)-associated reactive microglia. Activation phases scheme.
  It is proposed that the pro-inflammatory (M1) activation of microglia and macrophages
  includes two metabolic steps: early and late activation. (A) The early activation
  is mediated by P2X7Rs (1). Activated microglia relies on a glycolytic metabolism
  (2) followed by mitochondrial oxidation with an intact TCA cycle (3). A part of
  glucose is used in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to obtain the substrates
  for biosynthesis and NADPH for the reduction of GSGG, gaining antioxidant power
  (4). (B) In the M1 late activation, microglia and macrophages overexpress P2X7Rs
  and GLUT (1). Despite the upregulation of Nrf2, excessive ROS are produced (2).
  ROS leads to mitochondrial impairment (3). TCA cycle has a deficient step in IDH
  and SDH with consequent accumulation of citrate and succinate (4), which favor the
  production of inflammatory cytokines. The brain microglial ROS may result in the
  formation of the NF-kB p50 radical, leading to the loss of function of Arg-1 and
  the consequent production of NO from L-arginine (5). NO drives the switch toward
  the aerobic glycolytic metabolism with the release of lactate. (C) M2 activation.
  The lactate in the ECM and the tumor-induced hypoxia stabilize the HIF1-α while
  the condition of glucose starvation constrains the cells to FAO metabolism (1) and
  mitochondrial rewiring. Glutamine-derived compounds enter the TCA cycle (anaplerosis)
  or are involved in the GSH synthesis (2). HIF-α and 2-HG restrain the inflammatory
  genes and promote anti-inflammatory behavior (3). Arg-1 upregulation reduces the
  substrate availability for the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) with consequent
  NO reduction (4). All the figures consider the metabolic changes and do not include
  the nuclear compartment. More detail in the text. ECM = extracellular matrix; ATP
