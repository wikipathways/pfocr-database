caption: Ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis induction contributed to the EMT inhibition
  was through activation of Nrf2 in action of mechanism of DpdtbA. Ferritinophagy
  induction caused ROS production, accordingly triggered to ferroptosis and Nrf2 response.
  The activation of Nrf2 led to downregulation of snail, ultimately achieving the
  EMT inhibition.
