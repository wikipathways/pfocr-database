caption: Schematic of the glycerol metabolic pathway in E. coli. Protein members of
  the glycerol metabolic pathway includes glycerol facilitator (GlpF/AQP), a member
  of the aquaporin family of major intrinsic proteins. The soluble glycerol kinase
  (GK) phosphorylates glycerol to G3P. Another membrane protein constituent of this
  pathway is the transporter for the uptake of G3P (GlpT) with concomitant exit of
  Pi. Oxidation of G3P to DHAP is catalyzed by the monotopic membrane enzyme, glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GlpD), a primary dehydrogenase. Concurrent with oxidation of G3P
  is reduction of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to FADH2, which passes on electrons
  to ubiquinone (UQ) forming the reduced form (UQH2) and ultimately shuttling electrons
  to oxygen or nitrate.
