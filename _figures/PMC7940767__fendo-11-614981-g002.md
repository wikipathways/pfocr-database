caption: Simplified overview of the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway in the control of GH synthesis
  and secretion in somatotrophs. The modulation of GH synthesis starts with the activation
  of GPCRs and the control of the activity of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) enzyme by
  the action of either stimulatory Gα (Gαs) or inhibitory (Gαi) subunits. The activation
  of AC increases cAMP levels, which activates the protein kinase A (PKA). CREB is
  one of its targets, and phosphorylated CREB can stimulate the expression of the
  transcription factor pit–1, which upregulates GH mRNAs. The stimulation of phosphodiesterases
  (PDE) by PKA could elicit a negative feedback, limiting cAMP levels. The activation
  of adenylyl cyclase and the protein lipase C (PLC) induced by GHRH causes the rise
  in either cAMP or IP3, respectively, stimulating the calcium (Ca2+) influx, which
  in turn potentiates the exocytosis and release of GH. This mechanism involves the
  activation of Na+ channels to depolarize the plasma membrane to regulate Ca2+ influx
  by Ca2+–channels, and the mobilization of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. It
  was reported that cGMP could stimulate GH release independently of cAMP. Otherwise,
  the limitation of cAMP levels and the activation of K+ channels reduce the secretion
  of GH. Figure created with BioRender.com tools.
