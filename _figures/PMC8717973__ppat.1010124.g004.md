caption: PanAms are converted into CoA antimetabolites (CoA-PanAms) using 3 enzymes
  of the CoA pathway and reduce acetyl-CoA levels. Mutations in AcAS and ACS11 determine
  the resistance phenotype against iPanAms, which is indicated by the increased concentration
  of PanAms needed to kill parasites with mutations (yellow and orange lines) compared
  to wild-type parasites (gray line). Parasites are more resistant when both AcAS
  and ACS11 are mutated (dark orange line) than parasites with a single mutation in
  one of these enzymes (yellow and light orange lines). CoA-PanAm blocks the activity
  of the CoA-utilizing enzyme AcAS (red boxes), thereby reducing acetyl-CoA levels
  that may lead to downstream effects on protein modification or fatty acid metabolism
  in asexual blood stages. It is hypothesized that CoA-PanAm cannot bind to the mutated
  AcAS (dashed line), resulting in a normal level of acetyl-CoA. Whether ACS11 is
  a target of CoA-PanAm is still unknown. AcAS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; ACS11, acyl-CoA
