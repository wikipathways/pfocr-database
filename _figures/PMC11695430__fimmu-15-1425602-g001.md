caption: Protein signaling pathway involving both DAMPs and selected cytokines in
  ICD modulation. ICD inducer triggers HMGB1 secretion, CALR surface exposure, HSPA4/HSP90AA1
  surface exposure and secretion, and inflammatory cytokine secretion from dying cancer
  cells or damaged cells. Subsequently, HSPA4/HSP90AA1 and inflammatory cytokines
  can activate both NK and DC cells. NK cells secrete INFG and TNF to activate Th1
  and Th17 to secrete IFNG and IL17A, respectively. Moreover, DC cells secrete IL12A
  and IL12B to activate Th1 cells and secrete IL6 and IL23A to activate CTL cells
  for IFNG secretion
