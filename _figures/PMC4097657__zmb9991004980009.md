caption: Distinct mechanisms of Ste2 downregulation by the α-arrestins Ldb19, Rod1,
  and Rog3. The α-factor receptor (Ste2), a polytopic integral membrane protein, exists
  primarily in three conformational states. In näive cells, Ste2 undergoes spontaneous
  stochastic dissociation from its cognate heterotrimeric G protein (not shown for
  clarity) at a certain rate and thereby becomes destabilized. When it does so, it
  may misfold. Current evidence suggests that Ldb19/Art1 has a primary role in a PM
  quality-control pathway that mediates Rsp5-dependent ubiquitinylation and endocytic
  removal of such misfolded PM proteins. In the presence of α-factor, Ste2 undergoes
  a ligand-induced conformational change that activates and dissociates its cognate
  G protein; however, in this case, the receptor is stabilized by bound pheromone.
  Because Rog3-imposed inhibition of pheromone signaling does not obligatorily require
  its association with or modification by Rsp5, it may act similarly to classical
  arrestin or β-arrestin by binding to the C-terminal tail of the receptor and sterically
  preventing additional rounds of G-protein activation by the pheromone-bound receptor.
  Later during response to pheromone, Ca2+ influx will stimulate the CN-dependent
  dephosphorylation of Rod1, making Rod1 competent to mediate Rsp5-dependent ubiquitinylation
  and endocytic removal of the pheromone-bound receptor, a prime example of a stimulus-induced,
  late-stage, negative-feedback control.
