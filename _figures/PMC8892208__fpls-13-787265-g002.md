caption: Basic stoichiometries for sucrose and TAG synthesis and cellular energy cofactor
  budget. (A) Stoichiometries for the assimilation of CO2via the Calvin–Benson–Bassham
  (CBB) cycle into sucrose (green shading) or TAG based on balancing a generic plant
  stoichiometric model (see ) with fatty acid composition of TAG as in iTJC1414x4.
  Flux values are normalized relative to one mol of CO2 net assimilation. Oxygen consumption
  shown for TAG synthesis is due to fatty acid desaturase reactions. (B) Balance of
  ATP and NADPH between supply (photosynthetic light reactions) and demands (biosynthetic
  pathway). In modeling scenarios, the light reactions are thought to supply ATP and
  NADPH at a fixed ratio. If the supply ratio is above the demand ratio, then a surplus
  in ATP supply occurs that must dissipate in other processes. If the supply ratio
  is lower than the demand ratio of a biosynthesis pathway, then an NADPH surplus
  should result. However, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation allows for adjustment
  of the supply ratio. Otherwise, a NADPH surplus exists. CET, cyclic electron transport;
  F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; LET, linear electron
  transport; 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; PP, pentose phosphates; RuBP, ribulose 1,5-bis-phosphate;
  RubisCO, ribulose 1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase; S7P, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate;
