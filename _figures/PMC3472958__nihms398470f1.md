caption: Synthesis of VLCFAs and LCBs are shown as separate arms, the products of
  which are linked by ceramide synthase. Relative to phytoceramides produced from
  PHS, dihydroceramides are typically produced from DHS at minor levels (grey). The
  mechanism by which Cka2 regulates sphingolipid biosynthesis is unclear (question
  mark), but has been suggested to involve ceramide synthase (). Complex sphingolipids
  include additional head groups such as mannose and inositol (not shown). Modified
  from .
