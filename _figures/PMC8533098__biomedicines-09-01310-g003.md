caption: 'Metabolic characterisation of AD and PD subclasses. Flux balance analysis
  (FBA) was performed on iADPD1-3 genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), and flux values
  were compared with those of iADPDControl. Key metabolites and reactions within the
  androgen metabolism pathway are shown and key dysregulations are displayed as coloured
  arrows: red indicates increased flux compared to iADPDControl; blue indicates decreased
  flux compared to iADPDControl. Dysregulations associated to each GEM are shown in
  coloured boxes. The dashed line indicates multiple reactions are involved. Human
  Metabolic Reactions (HMR) identifiers are shown for androgen metabolism reactions
  with dysregulated fluxes. For full data, refer to .'
