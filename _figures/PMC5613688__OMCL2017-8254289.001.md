caption: LPS-induced abortion by regulating strong cellular network. After induction
  of LPS, binding protein interacts with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and activates
  downstream adaptor proteins MYD-88, which subsequently stimulate IKK complex, resulting
  in ubiquitination and phosphorylation of IkBα proteins that translocate NF-κB into
  the nucleus for production of several proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-β,
  IL-6, and PGF2E which causes microvascular damage leading to thrombosis, ischemia,
  necrosis of decidual cells, and finally abortion. On the other hand, flavonoids
  prevent abortion by inhibition of IKK complex proteins and bring NF-κB into its
  inactivated form in cytoplasm. These beneficial effects of flavonoids are mediated
  by activation of PI3K/Akt pathway; hence, it prevents development of free radicals
  by supplementation of flavonoids during pregnancy.
