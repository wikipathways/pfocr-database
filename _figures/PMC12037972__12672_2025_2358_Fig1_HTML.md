caption: The overview of serine-glycine-one-carbon (SGOC) metabolic pathway. Serine
  biosynthesis diverges from glycolysis, utilizing the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3-PG). The initial step in serine synthesis involves the PHGDH, which converts
  3-PG into 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (3-PHP). Subsequently, 3-PHP is transformed into
  phosphoserine and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) through the activity of phosphoserine aminotransferase
  1 (PSAT1), utilizing glutamate as the nitrogen donor. Finally, the catalytic action
  of phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) converts phosphoserine into serine. The removal
  of exogenous serine activates its biosynthetic pathway. Serine can be converted
  into glycine and CH2-THF, a one-carbon unit, through a reaction catalyzed by SHMT,
  which occurs in either the cytosol or the mitochondria. The activation of de novo
  serine and glycine biosynthesis, along with one-carbon metabolism, generates reductive
  equivalents that help maintain redox homeostasis and produce α-ketoglutarate and
  S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which are crucial for regulating DNA and histone methylation
