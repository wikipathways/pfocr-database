caption: Summary of transcriptomic, biochemical and metabolic findings, and the regulatory
  crosstalk on the recognized OP-targeted pathways in R. arenarum larvae. The OP pesticides
  AZM and CPF interfere in differential ways with the expected responses of protective
  enzymes, downregulating gene expressions in the regulatory pathways and their active
  states. The downregulation of MAPKs negatively affects the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant
  response and a cascade of antioxidant enzyme genes under ARE regulation. Nrf2-ARE
  and AP-1 downregulation in turn inhibit downstream the synthesis of polyamines essential
  for normal development and growth. The AhR pathway is negatively regulated by OP
  pesticides, affecting downstream gene expression of several detoxifying enzymes.
  In turn, the activities of some of the antioxidant enzymes may act by diminishing
  ROS impact and oxidative stress caused by OP metabolization, collaborating in the
  downregulation of Nrf2 pathway. Polyamines also downregulate the transcription and
  activation of their synthesizing enzymes and upregulate some of their metabolizing
  enzymes, acting in concert with some transcription factors, and this delicate balance
  in their levels is affected by AZM and CPF.
