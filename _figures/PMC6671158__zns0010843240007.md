caption: Model of the proposed p75NTR- and GIRK channel-mediated cell death signaling
  pathway. Death signaling is activated by metalloprotease cleavage of p75NTR after
  stimulation by mature or proneurotrophins (NGF). The C-terminal fragment of p75NTR
  activates Rac, which in turn activates PIPKI, with signal transduction assisted
  by colocalization of signaling molecules within lipid raft-like membrane domains.
  The locally generated PtdIns(4,5)P2 (PIP2) then binds to the C-terminal domain of
  neighboring GIRK2 subunits, activating GIRK1/2 heterotrimeric channels. The resulting
  efflux of potassium through the GIRK channels lowers the intracellular potassium
  concentration, releasing inhibition of the apoptosome, and resulting in capsase
  activation and ultimately cell death.
