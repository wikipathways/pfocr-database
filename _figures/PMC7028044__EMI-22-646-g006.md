caption: Expression changes of metabolism genes in rice stamens in response to Ustilaginoidea
  virens infection. Rice stamens were collected from mock‐ and U. virens P4‐inoculated
  spikelets of rice accession Pu6 and subjected to comparative RNA‐Seq analysis. Differentially
  expressed genes (DEGs) (absolute Log2 Fold change ≥1 and P value < 0.05) were mapped
  to the Metabolism pathway with MapMan software. Red points represent upregulated
  genes, while blue points represent downregulated ones. Dotted line rectangles represent
  pathways of particular interest. Expression data are included in .
