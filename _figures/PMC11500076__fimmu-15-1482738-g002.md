caption: The STING signaling in dendritic cells (DCs). The STING pathway in DCs plays
  a vital role by taking up tumor-derived DNA, leading to increased type I IFN expression.
  This enhances DC cross-presentation, survival, lymph node homing, and the expression
  of Th1 chemokines, crucial for immune cell trafficking (Created with Biorender)
