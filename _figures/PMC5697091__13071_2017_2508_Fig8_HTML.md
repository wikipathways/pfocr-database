  the differently expressed genes between Cryptocaryon irritans-infected and non-infected
  S. marmoratus, 72 h (group D) and 96 h (group E) post-challenge and uninfected fish
  were sampled as control (group A). c group D vs group A; d group E vs group A. Red
  indicates significantly increased expression; green indicates significantly decreased
  expression, and pink indicates unchanged expression. Blue denotes genes that were
  not identified in the expression profile analysis
