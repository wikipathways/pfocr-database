caption: A hypothetical model for the role of lncRNAs in rheumatoid diseases. Lnc-DC
  was down-regulated in the plasma of SLE. Lnc-DC regulates the expression of STAT3
  which plays a crucial role in Th17 differentiation. The downregulation of lnc-DC
  in SLE might regulate Th17 cell differentiation and thus involved in the pathogenesis
  of SLE. MALAT1 increases the expression of caspase3 and caspase9 and promotes the
  apoptosis of RAFLS cells in RA. MALAT1 is involved in the regulation of expression
  of E2F1 and thus the cell growth and apoptosis. Also, MALAT1 can inhibit the activity
  of PI3K and thus suppress the proliferation of RAFLS in RA. Th9 cells can produce
  IL-9 which promoting the activity of PI3K in RAFLs. The expression level of MALAT1
  was increased in SLE and its expression was correlated with the expression of IL-21
  and SIRT1 signaling in SLE. MALAT1 can affect the expression of IFI44 which was
  identified as one of the classifier genes to differentiate pSS from healthy controls.
  NEAT1 was up-regulated in monocyte of SLE patients with unknown mechanism. NEAT1
  targeted to MAKP pathway in SLE. TMEVPG can regulate the expression of INF-γ which
  inducing the expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10 and thus involve in the pathogenesis
  of SLE and pSS. Gas5 is down-regulated in CD4 T and B cells of patients with RA
  and patients with SLE. mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)can induce the accumulation
  of GAS5 during growth arrest of cells. GAS5 can induce cell cycler arrest at the
  G0/G1 phase by inhibiting the transcription of gene such as glucocorticoid receptor
  and androgen. GAS5 also acted as microRNA sponge to absorb and quench microRNA like
  miR-21 which is essentially involved in promoting Th17 cell differentiation and
  contribute to pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. lncRNA C5T1, located in
  a susceptibility locus of RA, positively regulate the expression of C5 which has
  been suggested to play an essential role in pathogenesis of RA and its animal models.
  The yellow color indicates lncRNAs, the blue color indicates the molecular interacted
  with lncRNAs, and the red color indicated the cells that lncRNAs function. The dash
  arrows indicate the interaction was predicted and the solid arrows indicates the
  interaction were confirmed by related assay.
