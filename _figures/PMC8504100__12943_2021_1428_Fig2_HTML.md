caption: 'Crosstalk between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune components
  in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). CAFs can orchestrate an immunosuppressive
  TME via interacting with the immune microenvironment in tumor. Through the secretion
  of multiple chemokines, cytokines and other effector molecules such as transforming
  growth factor-beta (TGF-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12),
  C–C chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) along with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2), CAFs modulate immune cells-mediated antitumor immunity through the following
  pathways: Promoting the trans-differentiation or polarization of immune cells such
  as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), mast
  cells (MCs), dendritic cells (DCs) and T lymphocytes into certain protumorigenic
  cell subsets; Facilitating the activities of immune inhibitory cells in terms of
  recruitment, activation and immunosuppressive effects including M2-type TAMs, N2-type
  TANs, regulatory DCs (rDCs), regulatory T(Treg) cells and myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells (MDSCs); Restricting the cytotoxic activity and cytokines production of effector
  immune cells like natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).
  Notably, several infiltrating immune cells such as TAMs, TANs, MCs and DCs can in
  turn exert promoting effect on CAFs activation and function, thereby contributing
  to the formation of immune suppressive loops. Moreover, CAFs can also upregulate
  the expression of immune checkpoint molecules such as programmed cell death protein
  1 (PD-1)/programmed death receptor ligand-1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associate
  protein-4 (CTLA4)/B7 in both themselves and other cells in the TME to induce T-cells
  dysfunction. Meanwhile, CAFs are able to remodel extracellular matrix (ECM) to facilitate
  immune suppression through the production of fibronectin, collagen and metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) as well as the activation focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway.
  Finally, immune checkpoint molecule overexpression on CAF surface as well as matrix
  deposition around would inhibit CAF apoptosis and facilitate their activation and
  function'
