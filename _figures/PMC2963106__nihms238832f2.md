caption: Binding of the HIFα–HIFβ heterodimer to the HRE in the promoter region results
  in transcriptional upregulation of genes important to the cell’s response to hypoxia.
  These include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth
  factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX),
  erythropoietin (EPO), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), and BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19
  kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3). Binding of ligands, such as VEGF, to their respective
  cell surface receptors, such as VEGFR, leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the
  receptor and subsequent downstream signaling through several kinase-dependent pathways,
  such as the PI3K–Akt–mTOR pathway and the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway. Note that mTOR
  leads to upregulation of basal levels of HIFα. Also shown within these pathways
  is a subset of the known therapeutic target sites for the monoclonal antibody to
  VEGF (bevacizumab), the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib and sunitinib), and
  the mTOR inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus). AKT, protein kinase B; HIFα,
  hypoxia-inducible factor alpha; HIFβ, hypoxia-inducible factor beta; HRE, hypoxia
  response element; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase.
