caption: Model of the role of Piezo1 and Gq/G11 proteins in endothelial response to
  different flow patterns. (A and B) Laminar flow (A) and disturbed flow (B) activate
  the same initial signaling processes involving the mechanosensitive cation channel
  Piezo1 and the purinergic receptor P2Y2, as well as Gq/G11-mediated signaling and
  activation of the mechanosignaling complex consisting of PECAM-1, VE-cadherin, and
  VEGFR2. In cells exposed to laminar flow, integrins are not activated and this initial
  signal transduction pathway promotes atheroprotective signaling including activation
  of eNOS through PI-3-kinase and AKT. Through incompletely understood pathways, eNOS
  is also activated by cAMP acting through protein kinase A (PKA). In cells exposed
  to disturbed flow, activation of the initial signaling pathway results in integrin
  activation, which promotes via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) NF-κB activation and
  atherogenic signaling, as well as reduced eNOS activation by promoting cAMP degradation
  via activation of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D).
