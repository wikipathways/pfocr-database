caption: Model of potential mechanism of AICD-mediated gene regulation. The two different
  APP cleavage pathways have been shown to occur in distinct subcellular localizations.
  While the non-amyloidogenic pathway by α- and γ-secretase cleavage takes place at
  the plasma membrane, the amyloidogenic APP processing is discussed to take mainly
  place in endosomes. The APP intracellular domain (AICD) generated by non-amyloidogenic
  APP processing is rapidly degraded by, e.g., the proteasome, insulin-degrading enzyme
  (IDE), Cathepsin B, and Caspase-3 into smaller fragments. In contrast, AICD generated
  by amyloidogenic APP processing can be stabilized by binding to Fe65 or JIP-1 and
  translocated to the nucleus, where the gene regulatory AFT (AICD, Fe65, Tip60) or
  AJT (AICD, JIP-1, Tip60) complexes are formed. Alternatively to Tip60, the transcription
  factor CP2/LSF/LBP1 is hypothesized to interact with Fe65 and activate AICD-mediated
  gene transcription. Binding to the MED12 protein links these complexes to the RNA
  polymerase transcription apparatus. Additionally binding of AICD to MINT1/X11α or
  the interaction of Dexras1 with the PTB2 domain of Fe65 results in an inhibition
  of Fe65/AICD induced transcription.
