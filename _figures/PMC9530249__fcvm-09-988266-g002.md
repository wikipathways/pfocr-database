caption: NF-κB and ER stress in three phases of AS. (A) Atherogenesis. Endothelial
  dysfunction as an initial event in atherogenesis is induced by NF-κB and downstream
  inflammatory mediators. The SREBP pathway is induced by ER stress and aggravates
  endothelial dysfunction. SREBP- and NF-κB-induced NLRP3 inflammasome contributes
  to atherogenesis. Chemokines induced by NF-κB attract lymphocytes and trigger endothelial
  inflammation. NF-κB also promotes the recruitment and differentiation of monocytes
  by increasing the levels of adhesion molecules and M-CSF of endothelial cells. After
  differentiated into macrophages, UPR markers are activated, which protects macrophages
  from ER stress-induced apoptosis. (B) Plaque progression. This phase is characterized
  by foam cell formation, VSMC migration and proliferation, ECM accumulation, and
  NC formation. ROS/NF-κB regulates the migration and phenotypic switch of VSMCs.
  Circ-Sirt1 inhibits NF-κB and thus alleviates the progression of AS. Macrophages
  uptake oxLDL via CD36 and this triggers the NF-κB signaling pathways, which promotes
  the transformation into foam cells. XBP-1 also regulates foam cell formation, endothelial
  apoptosis and VSMC calcification. Inhibition of ER stress promotes the formation
  of M1 subtype and subsequent foam cell formation. In macrophages, activated NLRP3
  inflammasome causes pyroptosis and apoptosis via caspase. (C) Plaque rupture. This
  phase is characterized by less SMCs and collagen, and more lipids and macrophages,
  which could involve NF-κB-FasL pathway. Macrophages induce plaque rupture by secreting
  MMPs, which is regulated by TLR4/NF-κB and RAGE/NF-κB signaling. Apoptosis of macrophages
  and VSMCs is induced by the prolonged ER stress, including PERK and IRE-XBP1. CHOP
  is also a mediator of apoptosis, vascular remodeling and plaque necrosis, whose
  expression is promoted by UPR signaling. Nrf2, as a synergistic mediator between
  NF-κB and ER stress, has an athero-protective role by upregulating some antioxidant
  enzymes. Additionally, NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated up-regulation of MMPs predisposes
  plaque to rupture.
