caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of ferulenol (2) and its isomeric structure
  (3) reconstructed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS carrying pCDFDuet-AtaPT-CstDXS, where
  4HC (1) was the fed precursor. Note that both products can be formed without any
  supply of prenyl donors (i.e., FPP) and secreted into the culture medium. PYR =
  pyruvate; G3P = glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; IPP = isopentenyl pyrophosphate; DMAPP
  = dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; GPP = geranyl pyrophosphate; FPP = farnesyl pyrophosphate;
  IDI = isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase; IspA = geranyl pyrophosphate synthase
  and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase.
