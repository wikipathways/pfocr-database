caption: A dataset describing release of five cytokines after three hours under conditions
  identical to those under which protein phosphorylation was measured was combined
  with the phospho-protein dataset. PKN2D was further extended to include links from
  protein signals that occupied unique principle component space () to nodes of cytokine
  release after three hours. Training this network to the data indicated that the
  growth and survival pathways were not needed to describe cytokine release. Thus,
  the PKN was revised to link only Stat3, NFκB, c-Jun, and Hsp27 to the cytokine release
  nodes, and this PKN was trained to the experimental dataset of both cytokine release
  and protein phosphorylation. In contrast to the cFL models describing only signaling
  activation, we found that the family of 141 cFL models fit the cytokine response
  data with a wider distribution of MSE. The resultant sub-family of seven filtered
  cFL models that fit the data with a MSE less than the average plus one standard
  deviation of the family MSE is shown. Nodes represent proteins that were either
  ligand stimulations (green), inhibited (orange), phosphorylation states measured
  (blue), cytokine secretion measured (yellow) or could not be removed without introducing
  potential logical inconsistency (white). The grey/black intensity scale of the gates
  corresponds to the proportion of individual models within the family that include
  that gate. The graph of the cFL models was generated by a CellNOpt routine using
  the graphviz visualization engine (www.graphviz.org) followed by manual annotation
  in Adobe Illustrator.
