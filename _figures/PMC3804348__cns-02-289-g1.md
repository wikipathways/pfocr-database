caption: 'Receptor tyrosine kinase/PI3K/Akt signaling via upregulation of SREBP-1
  promotes fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol uptake. ACC and FAS are direct downstream
  genes of SREBP-1 and key molecules in the regulation of de novo fatty acid synthesis.
  LDLR is upregulated by SREBP-1 to promote cholesterol uptake. Activation of LXR
  stimulates ABCA1 expression and promotes cholesterol efflux; it also reduces LDLR
  levels via upregulating Idol, a ubiquitin ligase E3. The light red boxes designate
  the molecules upregulated in glioblastoma (GBM) and could be potential therapeutic
  targets in GBM. The light blue boxes signify the molecules that negatively regulate
  GBM growth. Fatostatin is a SREBP-1 inhibitor; GW3965 is a LXR synthetic agonist;
  HMG-CoA R is a key enzyme in the pathway of de novo cholesterol synthesis; and statin
  is a HMG-CoA R inhibitor.HMG-CoA R: HMG-CoA reductase; LDLR: Low-density lipoprotein
  receptor; RTK: Receptor tyrosine kinase.'
