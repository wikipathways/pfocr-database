caption: Two hypothetical biosynthetic pathways for the formation of a C20 []-ladderane
  fatty acid. Locus in K. stuttgartiensis (and D. psychrophila) identified as potentially
  responsible for catalysing steps in the pathway have been indicated. (a) the precursor
  PUFA molecule is synthesised from a C20:0 fatty acid using a desaturase to insert
  double bonds. The PUFA is then folded into a ladderane using a radical cascade mechanism,
  analogous to a previously proposed polycyclisation mechanism []. (b) Alternatively,
  the ladderane moiety could be synthesised via an as yet unknown pathway and brought
  into FASII via an unusual paralogue of FabF, attached to an acyl chain and released
  from FASII. The post-processing step is thought to be the same, irrespective of
  the pathway the ladderanes are synthesised. The last step shows the ester linkage
  of the ladderane fatty acyl group to L-glycrol 3-phosphate, during the synthesis
  of ladderane glycerophospholipids.
