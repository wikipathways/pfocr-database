caption: SMYD3 as a new enhancer in Ras-driven cancers via its cytoplasmic functions.
  Mutant Ras-induced activation of ERK1/2 is promoted by SMYD3-mediated methylation
  of the cytoplasmic kinase MAP3K2, which impedes its binding to the phosphatase PP2A,
  leading to the up-regulated activity of the canonical RAS pathway. Thereby the impact
  of phosphatase PP2A, a negative regulator of Ras-ERK1/2 signaling, is inhibited,
  resulting in the formation of various adenocarcinomas. The PP2A phosphatase complex
  binds to MAP3K2, attenuating the MAPK pathway. Its methylation impacts this interaction.
  Activation of the MAPK and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling module is potentiated by SMYD3-mediated
  methylation of MAP3K2. SMYD3, SET and MYND domain containing protein 3; MAPK, MAP
  kinase; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
