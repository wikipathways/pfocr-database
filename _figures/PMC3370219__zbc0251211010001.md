caption: Direct and indirect pathways for Asn and Asn-tRNAAsnsynthesis. A, schematic
  representation of the direct pathway of Asn-tRNAAsnsynthesis. AspRS1, bacterial-like
  aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. B, schematic representation of the indirect pathway that
  usually compensates for the absence (red cross) of AsnRS or AS. AspRS2, archaeal-like
  non-discriminating aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. C, increase in the number of protein
  partners when the indirect pathway is used, especially in the case of Cac. Based
  on the bacterium gene content, there is triplication in AspRSs (AspRS2o, AspRS2,
  and AspRS1) and duplication in GatCABs (GatCABo and GatCAB). Cac also encodes for
  two truncated asparagine synthetases (AsnB), Nt-AS and Ct-AS. D, schematic representation
  of the operon organization of aspS2ogatCABo regulated at the transcriptional level
  by the NT-box. The latter is found at the 5′-UTR of the operon. Asn may come from
  other sources than asparagine synthetase-dependent amidation of Asp.
