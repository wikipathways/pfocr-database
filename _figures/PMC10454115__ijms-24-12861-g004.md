caption: An overview of the mechanisms of Pi, Tf, Td, and Cr in AS. Td infection induces
  the secretion of IL-8 and MCP1 by ECs, promoting the adhesion and aggregation of
  monocytes towards the sub-endothelial space. Pi, Cr, and Tf can activate macrophages
  via the TLR2/4 signaling pathway, leading to increased production of inflammatory
  mediators. Additionally, Tf can also promote macrophage-derived foam cell formation
  induced by ox-LDL (drawn by Figdraw)
