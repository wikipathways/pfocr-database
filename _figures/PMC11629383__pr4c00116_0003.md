  A. POU5F1 (green) has 7 copies in the human genome. POU5F1P1 (blue) is protein coding,
  while the other copies are noncoding according to Ensembl (version 110). POU5F1P5
  is disconnected from the tree as it was not included in the cited study.48 B. Boxplot
  of the expression of each gene in the tissue with the highest detection according
  to GTEx58 (version 1.1.9). The expression is reported in transcript per million
  (TPM) and was highest in the kidney for POU5F1, cervix for POU5F1P1, nerve and brain
  for POU5F1P3 and POU5F1P4, testis for POU5F1P6, adipose tissue for POU5F1P7 and
  POU5F1P2, and skin for POU5F1P5. The relatively low expression (maximum of 12 TPM)
  can be explained by the fact that GTEx data are derived from adult tissue samples,
  while POU5F1 is known to be expressed in undifferentiated cells. Additionnaly, GTEx
  de facto excludes multimapping reads, which would underestimate the expression levels
  as POU5F1 shares a high sequence homology with its pseudogenes. C. POU5F1P1-encoded
  protein has a 95.8% homology with POU5F1. Mutations include 4 amino acid substitutions
  (pink) in the POU DNA-binding domains (purple), the HOX (green) box, and the disordered
  region in-between (yellow). The model was built by SWISS-MODEL on template 3l1p.1.
  D. POU5F1 (green) and NANOG (yellow) are both transcription factors maintaining
  cell pluripotency and self-renewal ability. Both the parental genes and their pseudogenes
  are associated with cancer,40 although the function of POU5F1B (blue) and NANOGP8
  (violet) proteins remains unknown. The parental genes POU5F1 and NANOG are mostly
  expressed in embryonic cells147 while the POU5F1P1 and NANOGP8 are expressed in
  differentiated cells and cancer cells. POU5F1B expression is associated with the
  upregulation of tumor-growth-inducting genes (e.g., EGF21, IL-8, AREG),36 whereas
  POU5F1 expression causes stemness properties of cancer cells. Both POU5F1 and POU5F1B
  could be regulated through the β-catenin-TCF complex and the WNT/NOTCH or PI3K pathways
  in cancer cells. NANOGP8 is thought to be involved in the same phenotypes than NANOG18
  such as tumor growth (through CDK4/6 and Cyclin D1 regulation), pluripotency, and
  self-renewal (activating embryonic stem cell (ESC) associated genes). SNAIL1 and
  p53 can activate and/or inhibit NANOG and NANOGP8 expression. NANOG and NANOGP8
  induce the expression of SNAIL2, which inhibits the E-cadherin promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT). Similarly, NANOG and NANOGP8 can activate the STAT3 regulatory
  pathway, causing antiapoptotic effects. E. NANOG (yellow) has 11 pseudogenes in
  the human genome. The processed pseudogene NANOGP8 (violet) and unprocessed pseudogene
  NANOGP1 (gray) are protein coding.51 F. Boxplot of the expression of each gene in
  the tissue with the highest detection according to GTEx58 (version 1.1.9). The expression
  is reported in transcript per million (TPM) and was highest in the testis for NANOG,
  NANOGP1 and NANOGP8, brain for NANOGP4, NANOGP5 and NANOGP11, adipose tissue for
  NANOGP3 and NANOGP10, skin for NANOGP2 and NANOGP9, liver for NANOGP6, and artery
  for NANOGP7. As reported above (B) for POU5F1 and its pseudogenes, the expression
  may be underestimated due to the analytical pipeline. G. In human PeptideAtlas,
  no unique peptide is reported for NANOG or NANOGP8 proteins. The theoretical coverage
  shows the limited regions likely to be observed by proteomics. A peptide with a
  variant (K82N) is reported as multimapping due to the reported variant rs2889551.
  The alignment of the nucleotide sequences highlights the identity between NANOG
  and NANOGP8 at this locus and question the exactitude of the variant call for NANOG
  (dark blue for identical nucleotides)
