caption: '(A) This cartoon of arenal tubular epithelial cell shows how Wnt signaling
  occurs primarily through β-catenin–dependent pathways in the absence of urine flow.
  Ligand binding by the frizzled receptor results in inactivation of the β-catenin
  destruction complex through the presence of disheveled (Dvl), increased β-catenin
  levels, and upregulation of effector gene expression of the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway. (B) Stimulation of the primary cilium, e.g. by urine flow, results in increased
  expression of inversin (Inv), which then reduces levels of cytoplasmic Dvl by increasing
  its proteasomal degradation. This allows reassembly and activation of the β-catenin
  destruction complex, thereby switching from the canonical to the non-canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway. The model is consistent with the finding that overexpression
  of β-catenin (equivalent to canonical Wnt signaling) leads to renal cysts in a mouse
  model (from: Germino Nature Genet 37:455, 2005).'
