caption: A, NvNotch is similar in organization and residue identity to those found
  in Bilaterian animals. B, Several DSL domain-containing sequences were isolated
  from N. vectensis. The Nematostella Delta contains one DSL domain, EGF repeats and
  a predicted transmembrane domain. Two additional DSL domain-containing sequences
  are unusual in the presence of multiple DSL domains. One of these sequences was
  found to contain a transmembrane domain. C, Four Hes genes (NvHes1-4) and three
  Hes-like (NvHl1-3) genes are present in N. vectensis. Conserved domains of the NvHes
  and NvHl genes are the bHLH domain (b and HLH), the orange domain (OR) and the C-terminal
  WRPW peptide. NvHes1 lacks a WRPW domain but maintains an orange and HLH domain.
  Positions of domains are indicated by numbers which refer to residues of the predicted
  protein.
