caption: Schematic representation of HSPB5 pathways present in skeletal and cardiac
  muscle tissue. Several stimuli such as heat shock, reactive oxygen species, ischemia,
  and osmotic and reticulum endoplasmic stress, lead to sustained activation of pathways,
  especially p38MAPK-MAPKAPK2, which result in progressive phosphorylation of HSPB5
  at serine 59. HSPB5 is proposed to function at different levels of interrelated
  cellular pathways. HSPB5 can interfere with the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
  at various steps. In particular, it interacts with Bax and Bcl2 inhibiting their
  translocation into mitochondria, as well as with cytochrome-c preventing cytochrome-c-mediated
  interaction of Apaf-1 with procaspase-9 to form apoptosome. HSPB5 suppresses apoptosis
  also by binding to the pro-caspase 12 and pro-caspase-3 and preventing its maturation
  into the proteolytically active enzyme. HSPB5 interacts with IKKβ and enhances its
  kinase activity, which leads to phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα,
  a negative regulator of NFκB, facilitating the nuclear translocation of the transcription
  factor. Moreover, in unfavorable conditions such as redox unbalance and reticulum
  endoplasmic stress, a series of pathways are activated to induce the transcriptional
  activation of HSPB5 as well as its interaction with actin filaments. HSPB5 participates
  to homeostasis of skeletal muscle via modulation of Ago2, a potent endonuclease
  belonging to the central core of RISC complex, as well as at post-translational
  level; it controls all steps of the protein life cycle such as folding, aggregation,
  refolding, and degradation. Black lines indicate activation; red lines indicate
  inhibition; dash lines represent the translocation into the nucleus. Ago2, argonaute
