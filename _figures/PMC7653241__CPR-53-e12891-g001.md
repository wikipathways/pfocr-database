caption: 'S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis and metabolism. Methionine (Met)
  is converted into SAM by MAT in an ATP‐dependent process. SAM is linked to four
  key metabolic pathways: transmethylation, transsulphuration, polyamine synthesis
  and 5′‐deoxyadenosyl 5′‐radical–mediated biochemical transformations. In transmethylation,
  SAM donates its methyl group to many substrates, including DNA, RNA and proteins,
  which are catalysed by specific methyltransferases (MTs). After transmethylation
  reactions, SAM is converted to S‐adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is hydrolysed
  by a reversible enzyme called SAH hydrolase (AHCY) to form homocysteine (Hcy) and
  adenosine. Hcy has two fates: to be remethylated to regenerate Met or to enter the
  transsulphuration pathway. In transsulphuration, Hcy is first converted to cystathionine
  and then to cysteine (Cys) and α‐ketobutyrate, catalysed by the enzyme cystathionine
  β‐synthase (CBS). Then, Cys is converted to various sulphur‐containing molecules,
  including glutathione (GSH), taurine, hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and sulphate (SO4),
  which is catalysed by the enzyme cystathionase (CSE). Both CBS and CSE require vitamin
  B6 as a cofactor. α‐Ketobutyrate is converted to succinyl‐CoA, which is metabolized
  in the mitochondria. Hcy is remethylated to regenerate Met via two routes: the MS
  pathway and the betaine homocysteine S‐methyltransferase (BHMT) pathway. In the
  MS pathway, 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) donates a methyl group to Hcy, which
  requires folate and vitamin B12. In the BHMT route, Hcy uses betaine as a methyl
  donor. In polyamine synthesis, SAM is first decarboxylated to form decarboxylated
  SAM (dcSAM). Then, putrescine uses dcSAM as a propylamine donor, which is transformed
  to spermidine (SPD) and spermine (SPM), yielding 5′‐methylthioadenosine (MTA) as
  a by‐product. MTA is used to regenerate methionine through the methionine salvation
  pathway. In 5′‐deoxyadenosyl 5′‐radical–mediated biochemical transformations, SAM
  initiates various radical chemical reactions, which are catalysed by a large family
  of SAM radical enzymes. These enzymes share a CX3CX2C motif forming a characteristic
  [4Fe‐4S] cluster. SAM is converted to [4Fe‐4S]‐methionine and a 5′‐deoxyadenosyl
  5′‐radical through binding to the [4Fe‐4S] cluster'
