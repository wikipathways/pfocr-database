caption: 'Hypothesis: Excess estradiol and reduced progesterone & testosterone seen
  in male and female patients with Graves’ and Hashimoto’s disease may increase growth
  factors and IGF-1 receptors, helping to facilitate the well characterized TED inflammatory
  pathway elicited by IGF-1R; it also may result in a vicious cycle with local IL-6,
  which will create more E2 by aromatizing local androgens, which will stimulate the
  creation of more IL-6, in addition to other downstream inflammatory effects. E2,
  estradiol; ERα, estrogen receptor α; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor;
  GH, growth hormone; P4, progesterone; *E2 has varying direct effects on IGF-1 depending
  on age, gender, concentration; **Luteinizing hormone, which is also increased in
  women in Graves’ disease, meaningfully increases IGF-1R as well.'
