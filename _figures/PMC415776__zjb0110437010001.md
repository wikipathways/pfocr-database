caption: 'l-Lysine catabolism by P. putida. l-Lysine has been proposed to enter into
  the periplasmic space through the OprD porin (). Subsequently, it is transported
  to the cytoplasm (the present study) and is metabolized through two branches that
  converge at δ-aminovaleric acid (, ). Further metabolism of δ-aminovaleric acid
  yields glutaric acid that is channeled to Krebs cycle intermediates. The thick arrows
  indicate the main catabolic pathway (Revelles, unpublished). The enzymatic steps
  are indicated as follows: 1, l-lysine decarboxylase; 2, cadaverine aminotransferase;
  3, 1-piperideine dehydrogenase; 4, l-lysine monooxygenase; 5, 5-aminovaleramide
  amidase; 6, 5-aminovalerate aminotransferase; 7, glutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.'
