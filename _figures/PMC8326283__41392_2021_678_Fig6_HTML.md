caption: Phase separation and immune response. a LLPS is involved in innate immune
  responses. Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)- cytosolic DNA (such as viral DNA) condensates
  are formed by the multivalent interactions between cGAS and DNA via LLPS. The cGAS-DNA
  condensates may function as a reaction crucible, which can concentrate the reactants
  (ATPs and GTPs) and enzymes (activated cGAS) to efficiently produce cyclic GMP–AMP
  (cGAMP), which initiates anti-viral immune responses via the TBK1/IKK signaling
  pathway. Similarly, RLRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5, can also sense the viral nucleic
  acids (DNA or RNA), thereby initiating anti-viral immune responses via the TBK1/IKK
  signaling pathway. However, whether RLRs can phase-separate with nucleic acids to
  promote anti-viral immune responses is still not clear. Ras-GTPase-activating protein
  SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a positive regulator of innate immune responses
  (including RIG-I-mediated cellular anti-viral pathway and cGAS-STING pathway) and
  a stress granule core protein. SARS-CoV-2 N protein forms condensates that incorporate
  RNA and G3BP1, which suppress the interaction between G3BP1 and cGAS or RIG-I, thereby
  inhibiting the anti-viral immune responses of the host cells. b LLPS mediates T-cell
  receptor (TCR) signal transduction. After being phosphorylated by Lck, a kinase
  of the Src family, the cytoplasmic domains of TCR will recruit and activate the
  tyrosine kinase ZAP70. Thereafter, the multiple tyrosine residues of LAT, a transmembrane
  protein, are phosphorylated by activated ZAP70. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues
  recruit the SH2 and SH3 domain-containing protein GRB2, Gads, and Sos1, thereby
  activating T cells through several downstream signaling pathways, such as the MAPK
  pathway. These molecules can form condensates to exclude CD45, which can dephosphorylate
  the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domains of the TCRs to inhibit T-cell activation
