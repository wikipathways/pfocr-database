caption: Signaling cascades implicated in developmental cell death and tissue homeostasis.
  Prevention of classic apoptosis pathways by genetic deletion of Bax and Bak (intrinsic)
  or impaired death receptor (DR) signaling (extrinsic) does not lead to major developmental
  abnormalities during embryogenesis or in surviving adults. Hence, additional cell
  death pathways have been implicated in the removal of excess cells during development.
  These pathways may involve caspases (green boxes) or not (blue boxes). Caspase-dependent
  cell death modalities involve apoptosis, ultimately engaging effector caspases 3,
  6, and 7 and immunologically silent cell death that ultimately leads to corpse removal
  by phagocytes. Pyroptosis—a pathway activated by Caspases 1 and 11 in innate immune
  cells, mainly macrophages—leads to the cleavage of Gasdermin D and possibly other
  members of this family that ultimately triggers plasma membrane rupture. Lysosomal
  cell death involves lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and can be induced
  by several triggers, such as Ca2+ overload, H2O2, extensive DNA damage, or possibly
  even DR signaling, leading to the release of cathepsins. These enzymes were reported
  to trigger either a necrotic, apoptotic, or apoptosis-like response, e.g., by involving
  the BCL2 family protein BID. Accordingly, caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent
  forms of lysosomal cell death have been reported. Entosis is a cell death that is
  triggered by signals from neighboring cells expressing E-cadherins or α-catenin,
  and those cells are engulfed, followed by phagosome-to-lysosome fusion, leading
  to cell degradation. Necroptosis is characterized by the activation of RIPK3 and
  phosphorylation of MLKL. It requires engagement of cell surface receptors, such
  as toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TNFR family members, or the interferon receptor
  (IFN). Engagement of these or other intracellular receptors, including DAI or TLR3,
  under conditions where Caspase 8 is inhibited triggers necroptosis. Caspase 8 can
  cleave and thereby inhibit RIPK1/RIPK3, which are needed to activate MLKL's pore-forming
  potential, leading to plasma membrane rupture during necroptosis. Programmed necrosis
  is induced by excess of Ca2+, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, or
  heavy metals, causing persistent mitochondrial membrane permeabilization through
  the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore that spans both the inner and
  outer mitochondrial membrane. Finally, ferroptosis is triggered by deprivation of
  cysteine, leading to glutathione (GSH) depletion and inhibition of the detoxifying
  enzyme GPX4, thereby causing lipid peroxidation and plasma membrane rupture by so-far
  undefined mechanisms.
