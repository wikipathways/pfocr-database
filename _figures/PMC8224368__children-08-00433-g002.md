caption: 'Susceptibility genes in Kawasaki disease in Japanese patients encoding molecules
  associated with T-cell activation. The present case had three significant single
  nucleotide variants (SNVs): ORAI1 (rs3741596), CD40 (rs4813003), or BLK (rs2254546).
  The types of SNVs, base substitutions, and genotypic patterns of the case are shown
  in parentheses. The single underline shows an alternative allele with risk for KD,
  and the double line means a neutral polymorphism. Shaded molecular names are encoded
  by the representative disease susceptibility genes in Japanese KD patients. Solid
  lines with arrows indicate activation, while dashed lines with arrows denote the
  suppression of the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. Abbreviations: BLK, B lymphoid
  tyrosine kinase; CASP3, caspase-3; FCGR2A, Fc fragment of IgG low-affinity IIa receptor;
  He, heterozygous genotype; Ho, homozygous genotype; ITPKC, inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate
  3 kinase C; IP3: inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate; IP3R, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
  receptor; KD: Kawasaki disease, NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; ORAI1,
  calcium release-activated calcium modulator 1; PLC, phospholipase C; Syk, spleen
  tyrosine kinase.'
