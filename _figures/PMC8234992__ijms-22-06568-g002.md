caption: Tripartite synapse consisting of glutamatergic neurons and astrocytic endfoot.
  Glutamate (Glu) is a ubiquitous excitatory neurotransmitter that causes cell death
  through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  ([Ca2+]i). The elevation of [Ca2+]i activates neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)
  leading to the production of nitric oxide (NO), which is a major cell death mediator
  of neurons. Released glutamate, therefore, must be taken up by astrocytic Na+-dependent
  glutamate transporters. Glutamate uptake stimulates astrocytic Na+, K+-ATPase, thereby
  enhancing glycolytic metabolism (aerobic glycolysis) in astrocytes. The increased
  lactate/pyruvate, end-products of glycolysis, then fuel the neuronal tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle as energy substrates (astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle model).
  Mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which injure neurons
  both acutely and chronically, in the central nervous system. Glutamate in astrocytes
  is converted into glutamine (Gln) and then recycled back to glutamatergic neurons
  (glutamate–glutamine cycle). Glu can also serve as an energy substrate, α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG). The activation of glycolysis in astrocytes increases flux into the pentose-phosphate
  pathway (PPP), a shunt pathway of glycolysis, at glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). In addition
  to allosteric regulation, the transcriptional regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme
  of PPP, G6P dehydrogenase, is under the Kelch-like enoyl-CoA hydratase-associated
  protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related factor 2 (Nrf2)
  system. Increased flux to the PPP increases the ratio of the reduced form and the
  oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH/NADP+), which
  is used to convert the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG) to the reduced form of
  glutathione (GSH). Glutathione can be transferred to neurons via Gln, cysteine (Cys),
  and glycine (Gly).
