caption: 'Deregulated alterations of glucose metabolism in HCC. Deregulation of glucose
  metabolism during the initiation and progression of HCC has been early and well
  emphasized, including glucose transporters, enzymes and substrates in glycolysis,
  pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis and TCA cycle. Newly discovered functions
  of metabolic intermediates have also been referred, as histone lactylation by lactate.
