caption: The aetiology of growth failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is multifactorial
  and includes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), genetic factors such as parental
  height and primary renal disease, prematurity and malnutrition, which especially
  limits growth in children with congenital CKD. CKD–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD),
  metabolic acidosis, anaemia, loss of electrolytes and water and disturbances of
  the somatotropic and gonadotropic hormone axes also contribute to growth failure.
  CKD is a state of growth hormone (GH) insensitivity that is characterized by deficiency
  of functional insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) due to reduced GH receptor expression
  in target organs such as the liver and disturbed GH receptor signalling via the
  Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)
  pathway due to inflammation-induced suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) expression
  and increased IGF binding capacity due to excess of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs).
  Finally, reduced release of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH),
  due to uraemia-related inhibitory factors such as angiotensin II (ANGII) and steroid
  treatment, might result in decreased circulating levels of bioactive luteinizing
  hormone (LH), hypogonadism and reduced pubertal growth spurt. The GH insensitivity
  in CKD can be overcome by the administration of supraphysiological doses of recombinant
  human GH, which stimulates IGF1 synthesis, normalizes somatomedin bioactivity, promotes
  longitudinal growth and likely improves adult height. FSH, follicle-stimulating
  hormone; PTH, parathyroid hormone.
