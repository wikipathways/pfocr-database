caption: Protective mechanisms of phytochemicals in AMD. This figure illustrates the
  protective mechanisms employed by phytochemicals in mitigating the progression of
  age-related macular degeneration (AMD). It highlights the activation of the Nrf2
  signaling pathway, which enhances antioxidant defense systems, and the regulation
  of apoptosis through the PI3K/AKT pathway. This figure also details how these compounds
  suppress oxidative stress in RPE cells and exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting
  pathways such as TLR4/NF-κB and MAPK. Additionally, the anti-angiogenic properties
  of phytochemicals are showcased, specifically their role in downregulating the HIF-1α/VEGF/VEGFR2
  signaling axis, which is crucial for preventing choroidal neovascularization
