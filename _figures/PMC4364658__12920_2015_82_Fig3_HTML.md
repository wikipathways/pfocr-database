caption: 'MiRNA targeted the signaling pathways of upregulated genes from macrophages
  in ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. The data which compared macrophage in ruptured
  atherosclerotic plaque with in stable plaque were obtained from GEO database. SAM
  was used to analyze the significantly differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05).
  Those genes enriched pathways and miRNA target gene pathways were clustered by DAVID
  based on Reactome pathway. A: Whole blood miRNAs target pathways. B: plasma miRNAs
  target pathways. Illustration combined the miRNA target pathways which were also
  involved in the coronary atherosclerosis plaque.'
