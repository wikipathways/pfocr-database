  could decrease miR-206 expression, while miR-206 was able to repress the pentose
  phosphate pathway genes (G6PD, PGD, TKT, and GPD2), reducing pentose phosphate pathway-related
  NADPH production and ribose synthesis and then giving rise to blockage of lung cancer
  cell proliferation. In addition, TGF-β1 enabled miR-206 to decline, whereas restoration
  of miR-206 significantly suppressed the level of Samd3 and TRIB2, leading to inhibit
  proliferation. However, miR-206 also directly repressed Bcl2 and c-Met expression,
  contributing to inhibition of cell proliferation in lung cancer.
