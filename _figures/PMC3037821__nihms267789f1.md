caption: 'The p160 ROCK is activated by several upstream pathways, including activated
  Rho-GTP and activated caspase 3. ROCK has a wide range of targets that are regulated
  when phosphorylated by ROCK. Downstream signaling of ROCK can influence many different
  biological responses, including cell migration, cell adhesion and apoptosis. ROCKi
  are believed to primarily inhibit the activity of ROCK 1 and 2, but may influence
  the activity of other kinases.ERM: Ezrin, radixin and moesin; GF: Growth factor;
  GFAP: Glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFR: Growth factor receptor; GPCR: G-protein-coupled
  receptor; MLC: Myosin light chain; MLCP: Myosin light chain phosphatase; NF-L: Neurofilament
  protein; NHE: Na+/H+ exchanger; PRK: Protein kinase C-related kinase; ROCK: Rho-associated
