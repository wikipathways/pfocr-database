caption: 'Schematic of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis, cargo content, and physiological
  roles. EV biogenesis begins with the formation of interluminal vesicles (ILVs) to
  generate multivesicular bodies (MVBs) via either an endosomal sorting complexes
  required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent or -independent pathway. (a) ESCRT-dependent
  biogenesis requires the involvement of the ESCRT machinery to assist in the inward
  budding and pinching off of the ILVs. (b) ESCRT-independent biogenesis relies on
  increased ceramide concentrations generated by neutral Sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2),
  causing the membrane to bud inward to form ILVs. (c) MVBs contain many ILVs that
  can be targeted towards the plasma membrane for extracellular release. (d) The MVB
  fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the ILVs, which upon extracellular release
  become EVs. (e) EVs can carry a variety of cargo, both cytosolic and membrane associated,
  including lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. (f) The biological consequences of
  EV release can be physiological, such as the elimination of cellular waste and cell-cell
  communication, or pathological, where disease-associated cargos contribute to cancer,
  inflammation, neurodegenerative disease, and infectious disease progression. Abbreviation:
  SM, sphingomyelin. Figure created with BioRender (BioRender.com).'
