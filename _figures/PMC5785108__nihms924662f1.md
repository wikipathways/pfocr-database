caption: Nociceptive stimuli are conducted from the periphery to the dorsal horn of
  the spinal cord, and then transmitted to the supraspinal regions via the spinothalamic
  tract (STT,  ) and spinoparabrachial tract (SPBT,  ). The major descending modulatory
  control pathway (DMCP,  ) is displayed on the right. This pathway crosses the midline
  at the level of the medulla. Coloured areas indicate the position of synapses, and
  therefore sites of additional neuronal processing and endocannabinoid signalling,
  in each pathway. The positions of laminae I–VI in the dorsal horn are indicated
  by dotted lines, while the black region in the brain represents the lateral ventricles.Thal.,
