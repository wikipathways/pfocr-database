caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of estrogen signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
  progression and immune modulation. (A) YAP signaling and ERα: Estrogen binding to
  ERα suppresses YAP (Yes-associated protein) signaling in HCC cells. This is achieved
  by enhancing YAP phosphorylation, preventing its nuclear translocation, and inhibiting
  downstream oncogenic pathways. The suppression of YAP by ERα contributes to tumor-suppressive
  effects, highlighting ERα as a potential therapeutic target in HCC. (B) JAK1/STAT3
  signaling and ERα: Estrogen binding to ERα modulates the JAK1/STAT3 pathway in HCC
  cells by stabilizing suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3). Cytokine stimulation
  activates JAK1, which then phosphorylates STAT3. Phosphorylated STAT3 translocates
  to the nucleus to regulate target genes involved in inflammation, immune response,
  and tumor progression. Estrogen’s modulation of this pathway helps control the immune
  response and liver inflammation, contributing to reduced susceptibility to HCC.
  Inhibition of STAT3 activation by estrogen enhances anti-tumor immunity and inhibits
  HCC growth. (C) JAK1/STAT6 signaling and ERβ: In HCC cells, estrogen signaling through
  ERβ suppresses the JAK1/STAT6 pathway. Cytokine stimulation activates JAK1, which
  then phosphorylates STAT6, promoting its nuclear translocation and activation of
  target genes involved in tumor progression and immune suppression. Estrogen’s modulation
  of the JAK1/STAT6 axis reduces STAT6 activation, leading to a less immunosuppressive
  tumor microenvironment and enhancing anti-tumor immunity in HCC cells. (D) LCAT
  signaling and ERα: Estrogen activation of ERα induces the upregulation of lecithin
  cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) in HCC cells, leading to enhanced high-density
  lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) production. This HDL-C production suppresses cholesterol
  biosynthesis, inhibiting tumor growth. Furthermore, HDL-C synergizes with lenvatinib,
  enhancing anti-tumor efficacy. Targeting the LCAT/HDL-C axis may improve immunotherapy
  and treatment outcomes in HCC'
