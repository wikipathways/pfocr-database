caption: Schematic of the major pathways of serine metabolism in a mammalian liver.
  Shown in red, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, the first enzyme branching from glycolysis
  in a three-step serine biosynthetic pathway uses NAD+ as a cofactor to oxidize 3-phosphoglycerate
  into phosphohydroxypyruvate. The product is then subsequently converted into phosphoserine
  via transamination by phosphoserine aminotransferase and, ultimately, to serine
  via phosphate ester hydrolysis and the enzyme phosphoserine phosphatase. Classic
  work by Snell [] suggests preferential upregulation of the serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  branch, leading to nucleic acid synthesis coupled with downregulation of the serine
  dehydratase and serine aminotransferase branches in some subsets of cancer cells,
  adapted from Snell [].
