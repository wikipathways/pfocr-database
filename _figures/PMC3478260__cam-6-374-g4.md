caption: Figure 4. L1CAM can trigger different signaling pathways. Schematic illustration
  of distinct signaling pathways triggered by L1CAM due to the interacting with different
  binding partners. (A) L1CAM homophilic interactions promote static cell-cell binding
  and trigger predominantly the MAPK pathway. This signaling can be modulated by interactions
  with growth factor receptors (GFR). (B) The binding of L1CAM to integrins triggers
  NFκB activation and renders cells more motile and invasive. Cleavage of L1CAM from
  the membrane generates soluble L1CAM. The intracellular fragment L1-ICD can translocate
  into the nucleus and activate gene transcription. (C) Upregulation of L1CAM by TGF-β
  allows L1CAM-integrin downstream signaling via FAK-Src. This pathway induces production
  and release of IL-1β that in turn activates NFκB via binding to the IL-1 receptor
  (IL-1RI).
