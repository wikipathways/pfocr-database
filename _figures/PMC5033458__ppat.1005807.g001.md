caption: (A) Gram-negative bacteria possess a unique branch from the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) that generates ADP- heptose precursors (ADP-hep) for incorporation
  of heptose (green hexagon) into the inner core of the LPS structure. Hep-1,7-PP
  (HBP) is synthesized in the second step of this pathway and is released from bacteria
  during growth or lysis. (B) Summary of the manners by which gram-negative bacteria
  can present HBP to mammalian cells and activate the TIFA-signaling pathway. TIFA
  is an intrinsic anti-parallel dimer, possessing a Threonine residue (Thr9), a central
  forkhead domain (FHA), and a C-terminal TRAF6 binding site (T6BP; green rectangle).
  Upon HBP detection, Thr9 is phosphorylated, driving head-to tail oligomerization
  via intermolecular pThr9-FHA interactions. TIFA oligomers or the ‘TIFAsome’ recruits
  and activates TRAF6, driving canonical NF-κB activation and inflammatory signaling.
  Inset fluorescence micrograph depicts HBP-induced TIFAsome formation (green, white
  arrow) in human colonic epithelial cells treated with HBP for 2 hours. Nucleus is
  stained with DAPI (blue), scale bar 5 μm.
