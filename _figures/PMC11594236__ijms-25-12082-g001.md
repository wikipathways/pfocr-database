caption: 'Cellular mechanisms involved in OA synovitis in osteoarthritis. OA is a
  multifactorial disease characterized by several risk factors such as mechanical
  stress, injury, metabolic dysregulation, but, above all, loss of chondrocyte cellular
  homeostasis that affects all other cells resident in the joint tissues. Deregulation
  at the cellular level triggers inflammatory mechanisms and determines the establishment
  of a self-sustaining low-grade inflammation, also known as “inflammaging”. The triggering
  of synovitis in OA is not entirely clear due to the overlap and mutual dependence
  of the mechanisms involved. The most accepted theory is that the loss of chondrocyte
  homeostasis is the first step in the chain of events. Chondrocytes are the only
  cell type of articular cartilage. Activation of inflammation-related signaling pathways
  induces the release of cartilage matrix-degrading enzymes such as MMP-13 and MMP-3,
  responsible for ECM remodeling in articular cartilage. ECM fragments (through the
  DAMPs they expose and the subsequent interaction of DAMPs with PRRs of immune cells)
  and proinflammatory mediators (such as cytokines) stimulate the inflammatory response
  of the synovium (1). Activation of inflammation leads to the recruitment of innate
  immune cells from the bloodstream (2) along with the activation of immunocompetent
  cells that reside in the synovium (mainly macrophages). The interaction between
  different immune cells in the synovium (3) fuels the production of multiple proinflammatory
  factors (4) that cause further tissue damage (5). This endless cycle is pivotal
  in sustaining the inflammatory milieu leading to the progression of the OA. Abbreviations:
  DAMPs, danger-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns; PRRs, pattern recognition receptors; CCL, C-C motif chemokine ligand;
  IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; MMP, matrix metalloprotease'
