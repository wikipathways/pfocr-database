caption: The network is composed of several pathways coordinately promoting tip-targeted
  exocytosis and positive and negative feedback loops, which may balance each other
  to maintain a certain size of the apical ROP1 cap that defines tip growth domain
  or may allow the oscillation of the ROP1 activity. ROP1 is locally activated in
  the PM to determine the site of exocytosis and activates multiple pathways leading
  to polar exocytosis. The RIC4 pathway promotes F-actin assembly and induces the
  accumulation of exocytic vesicles to the tip, and promotes positive feedback loops
  to increase the area of active ROP1 probably by targeting ROP1 upstream components
  such as RopGEFs and PRK2. Positive feedbacks coupled with diffusion rapidly generate
  the apical cap of active ROP1 that defines the tip growth domain. Meanwhile, ROP1
  also activates the RIC3–calcium pathway. RIC3-dependent Ca2+ promotes tip F-actin
  disassembly and facilitates exocytosis. Polar exocytosis is also promoted by another
  likely ROP1 effector, RIP1/ICR1, which subsequently target recruits the SEC3 exocyst
  subunit that mediates the tethering of exocytic vesicles on the PM. Polarized exocytosis
  brings the REN1 RhoGAP to the apical PM, which deactivate PM-localized active ROP1.
  Thus the REN1-based negative-feedback globally inhibits ROP1, prevents excess ROP1
  activation in the apical PM, and restricts the enlargement of the apical cap to
  the tip growth domain.
