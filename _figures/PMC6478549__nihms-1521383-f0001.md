caption: 'Cellular metabolism begins with the entry of glucose and subsequent metabolism
  in glycolysis (10-step series of reactions in the cytoplasm). Glycolysis yields
  two pyruvate molecules; this gets converted to lactate by the enzyme LDH or is shuttled
  into mitochondria for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). The TCA cycle yields 3
  NADH molecules and 1 FADH2 molecule which serve as electron donors for the electron
  transport chain and production of ATP. Other major metabolic pathways employed by
  fibroblasts include the pentose phosphate pathway and de novo serine/glycine metabolism.
  These pathways rely on metabolic intermediates from glycolysis. Additionally, activated
  lung utilize glutaminolysis for promoting pro-fibrotic activities. Glutaminolysis
  refers to the process by which glutamine is converted to alpha-ketoglutarate. Abbreviations:
  GLUT1, Glucose transporter-1; HK, Hexokinase; G6PD- glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  6GPD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; NADPH- nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; PFKFB3, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3; PFK, phosphofructokinase-1;
  PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT1, phosphoserine aminotransferase; PSPH,
  phosphoserine phosphatase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2; LDH, lactate
  dehydrogenase; GLS, glutaminase; NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; FADH2,
  flavin adenine dinucleotide; ETC, electron transport chain; ATP, adenosine triphosphate.'
