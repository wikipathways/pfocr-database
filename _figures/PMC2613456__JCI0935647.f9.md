caption: DCs play an important role in inducing the differentiation of Th17 cells
  through the TLR9 effector pathway that upregulates the Notch ligand dll4. In vivo
  granuloma formation induced by BCG/Mycobacterium Ag demonstrates larger granuloma
  formation in Tlr9–/– mice with decreased numbers of Th17 cells and mDCs in the lungs
  when compared with lung granulomas from WT mice. Further, Tlr9–/– mice showed an
  increase in IL-10 with a concomitant decrease in Th17 cell–related cytokines (IL-17,
  IL-6, IL-21, IL-23, and TNF-α) and a decrease in the levels of the chemokines CCL20
  and CCL22, important for DC migration, compared with levels in WT mice. The decreased
  expression of dll4 and the perturbation of the indicated cytokine and chemokine
  expression levels led to the abrogation of the Th17 phenotype in the Tlr9–/– mice
  with the concomitant increase in granuloma size. Accompanying these phenomena, there
  was a decrease in Th17 cells and mDCs in the lungs of Tlr9–/– mice and an increase
  in lung macrophages. L, lymphocyte; M, macrophage.
