caption: Glucose is taken up by glucose transporters (GLUT) and phosphorylated inside
  the myocyte by hexokinase. Glucose 6-phosphate may and enter a number of pathways.
  Glycolysis and glucose oxidation result in ATP generation which may inhibit AMP
  kinase. Fructose 6-phosphate is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate and enters
  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway ultimately leading to O-GlcNacylation of proteins.
  Glucose 6-phosphate can also enter the pentose phosphate pathway and generate xylulose-5-phophate.
  In our experiments we utilized several substrates, activators, or inhibitors to
  assess whether glucose 6-phosphate regulates mTOR activation. These are underlined.
  Inhibitors or activators are in italics as well. AICAR 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide. GFAT glutamine:fructose 6-phosphate amidotransferase, HK hexokinase.
