caption: 'The binding of an inflammatory stimulus, such as the bacterial endotoxin
  lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to the membrane-bound CD14-toll like receptor (TLR) complex
  in inflammatory cells (i.e., macrophage, microglia and dendritic cells) results
  in the stimulation of two different pathways involved in the transcription activation
  of several inflammatory mediators: nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) and a mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. In unstimulated cells, NFκB is sequestered in the
  cytosol by its inhibitor IκB. Cellular stimulation results in IκB phosphorylation
  by a specific kinase (IKK), triggering IκB ubiquitination, and proteosomal degradation,
  releasing NFκB to translocate to the nucleus where it binds to specific κB promoter
  elements. Interaction between NFκB and coactivators such as the cAMP-response element
  binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) is required for maximal transactivation.
  Such coactivators bridge various transcriptional activators and components of the
  basal transcriptional machinery. Meanwhile, the activation of MAPK kinase kinase
  1 (MEKK1) activates different MAPKs, leading to the phosphorylation/activation of
  cJun by Jun kinase (JNK), of TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) by p38MAPK, and of Elk1
  by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). cJun, which together with cFos
  comprise the activator protein-1 (AP1), which acts to transactivate various inflammatory
  genes through its binding to AP1 sites and cAMP-response elements (CRE). TBP participates
  in the initiation of transcription by recruiting the basal transcriptional machinery
  and various transcription factors through its binding to TATA-box sequences. On
  the other hand, the binding of IFNγ to its receptor initiates the phosphorylation/activation
  of the Janus kinases Jak1/Jak2, resulting in the generation of the phosphorylated
  signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) dimers, their translocation
  to the nucleus and the expression of the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) which in
  turn transactivates multiple effector genes. The binding of VIP to VPAC1 increases
  cyclic AMP (cAMP), activates protein kinase A (PKA) and inhibits IKK, stabilizing
  the inhibitor IκB and preventing nuclear translocation of NFκB p50/p65 complex (1).
  In addition, PKA activation induces the phosphorylation of CREB which, due to its
  high affinity for the coactivator CBP, prevents the association of CBP with p65
  (2). Furthermore, PKA activation inhibits MEKK1 activation, and the subsequent activation
  of p38MAPK and TBP (3). Non-phosphorylated TBP lacks the ability to bind to the
  TATA box, and to form an active transactivating complex with CBP and NFκB, resulting
  in inefficient recruitment of the RNA polymerase II, which further weakens transcription.
  Inhibition of MEKK1 also deactivates JNK and cJun phosphorylation (4). In addition,
  PKA induces the expression of JunB, which can inactivate the transcriptional AP1
  complex via displacement of of c-Jun with JunB or CREB. PKA activation can also
  inhibit both NFκB and MAPK pathways by downregulating TLR and CD14 expression (5).
  Finally, PKA signaling inhibits Jak-STAT1 pathway and subsequent induction of IRF1
  (6). The end result is that the complex of transcriptional transactivators, which
  were recruited to the promoters of several inflammatory mediators (tumor-necrosis
  factor-α (TNFα) is shown as an example) in response to the signaling via the TLR4
  receptor, is significantly disrupted by neuropeptide treatment (compare profile
  A with profile B). Arrows indicate a stimulatory effect. Back-crossed lines indicate
  an inhibitory effect.'
