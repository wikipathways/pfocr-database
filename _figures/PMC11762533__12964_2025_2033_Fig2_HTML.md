caption: 'Impact of HGF/c-MET Signaling Pathway on Immune-Suppressive Cells and Their
  Interactions: Immune-suppressive cells primarily include CAFs, TAMs, MDSCs, and
  Tregs. Firstly, abnormal activation of the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway can activate
  downstream pathways in M1-type TAMs, such as P13K-Arg1, P13K-HDM1-HIF2, and STAT3,
  promoting the polarization of M2-type TAMs. M2-type TAMs secrete cytokines like
  TGF-β, PGE2, and VEGF, which promote tumor progression. Secondly, the HGF/c-MET
  signaling pathway can activate the STAT3 pathway in MDSCs, leading to MDSC expansion,
  and promoting Treg proliferation through TGF-β secretion by MDSCs. Tregs can secrete
  various cytokines (IL-2, IL-10, TGF-β, CTLA-4) to inhibit the function of CTLs and
  NK cells. Additionally, the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway and FGF19/FGFR4 signaling
  can activate the ERK1/2-ETV4 downstream pathway in tumor cells, increasing the secretion
  of CCL2 and promoting the recruitment of MDSCs to the tumor site. CAFs can secrete
  various cytokines that affect other immune-suppressive cells: they induce M2-type
  TAM polarization by secreting MCP-1 and Chi3L1, indirectly induce M2 polarization
  in TAMs by increasing ROS production in M1-type TAMs, participate in the induction
  and maintenance of Treg cells by secreting VEGF-A, and recruit MDSCs to the tumor
  site through CCL2 secretion via the STAT3-CCL2 signaling pathway. This figure was
