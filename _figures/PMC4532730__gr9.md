caption: Catalase inactivation by low concentrations of photofrin-derived singlet
  oxygen requires an additional amplification step that is mediated by the FAS receptor
  and caspase-8A. (A) Low concentrations of singlet oxygen generated by low concentrations
  of illuminated photofrin (#1) inactivate few catalase molecules on the surface of
  tumor cells (#2). This allows a local stabilization of H2O2 (#3) and peroxynitrite
  (#4). (B) Locally stabilized H2O2 and peroxynitrite form singlet oxygen (#1) that
  activates the FAS receptor in a ligand-independent mode (#2). As a consequence,
  NOX1 activity is enhanced (#3) and NOS is induced (#4). (C) As a consequence of
  FAS receptor activation by singlet oxygen (#1), activation of NOX (#2) and induction
  of NOS (#3), more H2O2 (#4) and more peroxynitrite (#5) is generated. This allows
  for the formation of more singlet oxygen (#6) and inactivation of additional catalase
  molecules (#7). (D) As a consequence of primary (#1) and secondary inactivation
  of catalase (#2), H2O2 generated through dismutation of superoxide anions derived
  from NOX1 (#3) is no longer decomposed (#4) by catalase and drives peroxidase (POD)-catalyzed
  HOCl synthesis (#5). HOCl reacts with superoxide anions (#6), thereby generating
  hydroxyl radicals that cause lipid peroxidation (#7) and subsequent apoptosis induction
  through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. NO synthase (NOS) generates NO (#8)
  that is not oxidated by inactived catalase (#9) and forms peroxynitrite after its
  reaction with superoxide anions (#10). As peroxynitrite is not decomposed, protonation
  of peroxynitrite results in the formation peroxynitrous acid (#11) that generates
  NO2 and hydroxyl radicals that cause lipid peroxidation (LPO) and apoptosis induction
  (#12).
