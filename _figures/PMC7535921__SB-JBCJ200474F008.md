caption: 'A model depicting the regulation of FAAP20 stability by acetylation signaling.
  Top panel: cellular FAAP20 levels were determined by the competitive modification
  of Lys-152, which undergoes either ubiquitination by the SCFFBW7 ubiquitin E3 ligase
  to promote degradation, or acetylation by the p300/CBP acetyltransferase to antagonize
  degradation. Bottom panel: disruption of FAAP20 acetylation either by the depletion
  of p300/CBP or by the overexpression of HDAC3 renders the lysine residue of FAAP20
  susceptible to polyubiquitination, leading to FAAP20 degradation and defective FANCD2
  activation.'
