caption: A model for inhibition of capsidiol production by S-carvone. The binding
  of the elicitor to the receptor induces a signaling cascade involving at least one
  protein modified with a geranylgeranyl moiety. This results in activation of HMGR
  and EAS transcription and also in the corresponding enzyme activities required for
  the biosynthesis of capsidiol. Different inhibitors block the biosynthesis of capsidiol.
  For example, FOS, as an inhibitor of the  pathway, blocks the biosynthesis of plastidial
  ; both MV as well ALD block the -pool used for capsidiol biosynthesis; and S-carvone
  inhibits the PPTase activity that allows the transfer of the geranylgeranyl group
  onto the protein involved in the signaling pathway. Ac-CoA, Acetyl coenzyme A; ALD,
  alendronate; eas, 5-epi-aristolochene synthase; FOS, fosmidomycin; GAP, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; hmgr, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; Pyr, pyruvate; R, receptor.
