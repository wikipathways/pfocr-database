caption: Nearly magic-free mechanism for CLC Cl−/H+ transport. Cartoon depictions
  of the ion-binding regions show how the rotary movement of Eex through its four
  configurations (middle, up, out, and down), coordinated with Cl−/H+ binding/unbinding/translocation,
  can achieve 2:1 Cl−/H+ antiport. For clarity, one direction of the transport cycle
  is depicted; however, the mechanism works in both directions. This mechanism avoids
  previous magic, in that (1) it does not require deprotonated Eex to compete with
  Cl− for the anion pathway, (2) the opening of the extracellular pathway in the out
  conformation provides a clear pathway for Cl− ions, and (3) the rotation of Ein
  away from E113 allows H+ transport along water pathways and is thus consistent with
  the observation of coupled transport in CLC homologues that lack a titratable residue
  at the Ein position. The only remaining magical step concerns the inner gate, which
  is depicted here with dashed lines to indicate the uncertainty as to how and/or
  when the inner gate opens.
