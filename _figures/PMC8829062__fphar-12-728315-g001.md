caption: Main potential AMPK-dependent molecule mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective
  effects of metformin against AD pathology. Most presented mechanistic studies have
  implied an AMPK-dependent neuroprotective action of metformin against AD. The regulation
  of AMPK/mTOR/S6K/BACE1 signaling pathway by metformin can result in a reduction
  in Aβ production, thus decreasing Aβ toxicity. AMPK activation can also suppress
  the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is regarded as the central signaling
  pathway involved in AD neuroinflammation. Moreover, the increased activation of
  caspase cascade, which is involved in the apoptosis-mediated neurodegeneration,
  and the impairment of mitochondrial function and morphology induced by Aβ can be
  inhibited by metformin in an AMPK-dependent manner. AMPK, AMP-activated protein
  kinase; APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, amyloid-β; BACE1, β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1;
