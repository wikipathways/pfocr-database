caption: Fold change (log2[−P/+P]) of primary metabolites and P4Ha in response to
  P starvation. Fengqing (left column) and Longjing-43 (right column) and from the
  top to the bottom rows are young shoots (first row), leaves (middle row) and root
  (button row). YS, L and R represents young shoots, leaves, and root, respectively.
  Metabolites and metabolic genes inside background color box represents different
  biosynthesis pathway. The solid arrow shows direct and dotted arrow represents speculated
  steps in the pathway. The data depicted from  and Table 5, positive as increase
  and negative as decrease in fold change. On the false color scale red indicates
  increase; blue and green indicates decrease in metabolites and gene. aP4H means
  prolyl 4-hydroxylase.
