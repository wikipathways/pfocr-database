caption: A putative model of positive and negative loops in the regulation of CREB-1
  and CREB-2 expression and likely pathways by which Olibanum could control these
  loops. CREB-1, main memory transcription factor, regulates the expression of several
  genes such as its own and CREB-2 by binding to CRE sequences in the promoter of
  genes. To be activated, CREB-1 should be phosphorylated by kinases CaMK, ERK, PKA,
  AKT and MAPK. Each of these kinases is belong to a pathway which activated by different
  extracellular signals. Activated CREB-1 induces its own as well as CREB-2 transcription
  in a positive-feedback loop. Increased levels of CREB-2 promote the negative-feedback
  loop and repress the expression of its own and CREB-1. Olibanum is able to increase
  the expression of CREB-1 and then CREB-2 likely via phosphorylation and activation
  of CREB-1. However, the precise mechanism by which Olibanum induces signaling pathways
  is unclear and needs further investigation
