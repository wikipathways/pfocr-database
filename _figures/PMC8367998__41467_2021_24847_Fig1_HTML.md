caption: 'The intracellular pathway established specifically upon cisplatin-resistance
  and in presence of glucocorticoids is presented. Glucocorticoids (black circle)
  activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), an intracellular receptor that, when
  bound to ligand, can translocate to the nucleus (pathway on the right-hand side).
  There, the glucocorticoid receptor regulates its target genes via different mechanisms,
  directly or indirectly, and in a cell-type specific manner. Depicted are likely
  mechanisms, but alternative mechanisms are not excluded. Generally, pro-apoptotic
  gene expression (e.g. Bim), cell cycle arrest and anti-inflammatory gene expression
  are promoted, while pro-inflammatory (NF-kB-dependent) gene expression and anti-apoptotic
  gene expression are dampened. Besides glucocorticoid receptor monomer and dimer-driven
  mechanisms, also other mechanisms have been described to account for the indicated
  gene profiles (not depicted here). Cisplatin-resistance involves binding of cisplatin
  to the glucocorticoid receptor at Cystein 622, followed by its nuclear accumulation
  and its ability to enhance gene and protein expression of MAST1 (pathway on the
  left-hand side). On its turn, MAST1 can block the pro-apoptotic Bim, hereby establishing
  cisplatin-resistance. Addition of the MAST1 inhibitor Lestaurtinib relieves the
  brake on Bim and may restore sensitivity to platinum-based drugs. Lestaurtinib does
  not seem to affect the capacity of the glucocorticoid receptor to regulate other
  typical target genes, including those involved in the relief of side effects (not
  depicted here). Abbreviations: GR, glucocorticoid receptor, GRE, glucocorticoid
  response element, MAST1, microtubule-associated Ser/Thr kinase, TFRE, transcription
  factor response element.'
