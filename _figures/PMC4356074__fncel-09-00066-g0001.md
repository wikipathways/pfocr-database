caption: Active and inactive Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In the absence of Wnt ligands,
  the destruction complex consisting of Axin, APC, GSK3β, and Dvl (Adenomatous polyposis
  coli, Glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and Disheveled) resides in the cytoplasm where
  it binds to and phosphorylates β-catenin (β-cat), leading to its degradation. In
  this “off” state, T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) is inactive
  due to its interaction with the repressor Groucho. The pathway is activated upon
  binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled receptors and the co-receptor lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6, resulting in the sequestration of Axin, recruitment
  of Disheveled, and the disintegration of the destruction complex. Binding of R-spondins
  (R-spo) to Lgr4/5/6 receptor stabilizes Frizzled. Accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin
  allows it to translocate into the nucleus and bind the TCF/LEF family of transcription
  factors to upregulate Wnt target genes, including Axin2 and Lgr5.
