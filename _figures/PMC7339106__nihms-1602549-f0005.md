caption: Adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells can destroy both CD200+ and
  CD200- cancer cells while they fail to eliminate cancer cells that mutate tumor
  antigen. However, in the presence of tumor CD200 (lower panel), mutated cancer cells
  cannot grow back to tumor due to lack of help from myeloid cells, leading to tumor
  rejection. In the absence of tumor CD200 (upper panel), expanded myeloid cells can
  help mutated tumor cells regrow into a tumor, leading to tumor recurrence.
