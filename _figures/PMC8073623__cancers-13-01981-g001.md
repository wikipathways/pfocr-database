caption: Overview of the Hippo signaling pathway. Hippo signaling is initiated by
  a variety of upstream stimuli. Activation of Hippo (MST1/2) leads to subsequent
  phosphorylation of LATS1/2. LATS1/2 negatively regulates the Hippo pathway effector
  YAP/TAZ. Unphosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocates into the nucleus where it interacts
  with TEAD transcription factors to upregulate the transcription of a variety of
  genes. In contrast, phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ leads to its cytoplasmic sequestration
  by 14-3-3 proteins and degradation.
