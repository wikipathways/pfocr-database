caption: Siglec signaling and immune modulatory effect. Upon sialic acid binding,
  SRC kinases can phosphorylate tyrosine residues found in the cytosolic ITIM/ ITAMs.
  Within the inhibitory Siglecs, SHP-2 is recruited to the phosphotyrosines and can
  inhibit Sprouty (Spry). The inhibition of Spry promotes the activation of Ras-ERK
  signaling and subsequent ERK and Akt-dependent production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) [,]. ROS in sepsis can inactivate SHP-2, resulting in endothelial activation
  []. Additionally, SHP-2 can activate the NK-κB pathway, leading to inflammation
  and cellular immune responses []. On the other hand, SHP-1 inhibits the NK-κB pathway
  and controls cytokine production through the JAK-STAT pathway [,]. SHP-1 is associated
  with T cell inactivation, whereas SHP-2 is associated with the activation of M1
  macrophage phenotype [,]. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) competes with
  both SHP-1/-2 for phosphorylated ITIMs, thereby inhibiting signaling and resulting
  in accelerated proteosomal degradation of both Siglec-3 and SOCS3 []. Next, within
  the inhibitory Siglecs, DAP12 associates with the positively charged residue found
  in the transmembrane of inhibitory Siglecs. Subsequently, Syk bearing tandem SH2
  domains binds to the phosphorylated ITAM-containing DAP12 [], and results in the
  downstream generation of second messenger, elevated intracellular calcium, and the
  activation of MAPK/Akt pathways. Notably, Syk can be inhibited by SHP-1 [], and
  thus modulate the activating and inhibitory signaling of Siglecs.
