caption: 'Schematic diagram indicating the location of 14CO2 release by the different
  substrates used in this study. Note that 14CO2 release occurs in one to three reactions
  for some substrates (e.g. glutamate, lactate and glutamine); whereas, the release
  of labeled CO2 for [6-14C]glucose occurs far downstream from the initial metabolism
  and in the 3rd turn of the TCA cycle. The complete oxidation of some substrates
  including glutamate, glutamine, requires metabolism via the pyruvate recycling pathway
  as noted in the text. (Abbreviations: Glc, glucose; Lac, lactate, 3-HOB 3-hydroxybutyrate;
  Glu, glutamate, Gln, glutamine; Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; ME, malic enzyme;
  KGDH, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PAG, phosphate activated glutaminase).'
