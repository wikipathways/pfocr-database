caption: 'Intrinsic and extrinsic factors used during vertebrate lens development.
  The intrinsic factors Pax6, Sox2, Foxe3, Pitx1, Sox1, c-Maf, and Prox1 are required
  at different stages of lens development. Some of the extrinsic factors pathways
  involved in lens development are summarized here. Fgf signaling: there are 22 fibroblast
  growth factor ligands (Fgf) ligands and four receptors (Fgfr) in vertebrates, with
  some variability in ligands among species. Fgfs are secreted morphogens that act
  both short- and long-range to induce cell proliferation, morphogenesis, and cell
  type differentiation. Ligands bind to a heterodimeric receptor (Fgfr) complex having
  a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain that phosphorylates intracellular proteins upon
  ligand binding. Targets of Fgfr protein kinase activity include Ras and adaptor
  proteins Frs, Sos and Grb2 (reviewed in ). Activated Ras initiates a protein phosphorylation
  cascade— Ras to Raf to Mek to Erk—which terminates with translocation of phospho-Erk
  into the nucleus to stimulate factors such as Fos and Ets factors. Er81 and Erm
  are ETS factors expressed in the lens (). Ras also leads to phosphatidylinositol
  3 kinase (PI3K) and AKT activation to promote cell survival during lens fiber differentiation
  (). Notch signaling: the Notch pathway transduces a direct, cell-to-cell signal
  initiated by the binding of a membrane-bound ligand (Jagged or Delta-like proteins)
  on one cell to a Notch receptor on an adjacent cell (reviewed in ; ). Ligand binding
  triggers a series of proteolytic cleavages to the Notch receptor, ultimately releasing
  the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocate into the nucleus where
  it forms a complex with the transcriptional regulators Rbpj/Su(H) and Mastermind-like
  (MAML) to activate transcription of target genes such as the bHLH repressors Hes1
  or Hes5. The ligand Jag1 is critically required during lens fiber cell differentiation
  (). Bmp/Tgfβ signaling: the transforming growth factor β (Tgfβ) gene superfamily
  includes the Tgfβ, bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), growth and differentiation
  factor (Gdf), Activin and Nodal subfamilies. These secreted ligands bind to heterodimeric
  Type I and Type II receptor complexes (reviewed in ; ). There are seven Type I receptor
  genes and five Type II receptor genes in vertebrates, all containing cytoplasmic
  serine/ threonine kinase domains. Upon ligand binding, an active Type II receptor
  phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of a Type I receptor, activating its kinase
  activity, which then phosphorylates intracellular Smad effectors and other proteins.
  An activated Smad then complexes with a common mediator, Smad4, and translocates
  into the nucleus to regulate downstream gene transcription. These signals can be
  modulated by natural agonists, like Noggin, or by negative feedback from inhibitory
  Smads (reviewed in ). In lens development, Bmpr1a and Acvr1 are important and signal
  via Smad5. The Wnt/βcatenin Pathway: Wnts (wingless-type MMTV integration site proteins)
  are secreted signaling molecules that bind to a Frizzled (Fz) receptor and Lrp co-receptor.
  Once formed, this complex activates Dishevelled (Dvl), recruits Axin to the cell
  membrane, and this prevents phosphorylation of the intracellular β-catenin (Ctnnb1).
  This stabilized β-catenin protein translocates to the nucleus where it interacts
  with Tcf/Lef transcription factors, as well as the Pygopus (Pyg) co-activator to
  activate target genes. (reviewed in ). There are 19 Wnt ligands and 10 Fz receptors
  in vertebrates, of which at least six ligands (Wnts 5a, 5b, 7a, 7b, 8a and 8b),
  five Fz receptors (Fz 1, 2, 3, 4, 6), two co-receptors (Lrp 5 and 6) and multiple
  pathway agonists (Dkk, Sfrps) are all expressed in the developing mouse lens ()'
