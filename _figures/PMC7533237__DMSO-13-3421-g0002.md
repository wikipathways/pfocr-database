caption: Mechanisms of action of proteins and peptides from selected articles focusing
  on T2DM. The ZeinH peptide acts by stimulating GLP-1, which signals increased insulin
  synthesis. The Aglycin, Vglycin and ILP peptides stimulate the IRS1 and IRS, which
  favors the serum glucose uptake cascade. In addition, ILP possibly acts by inhibiting
  the NF-κB signaling pathway. The GOPs peptide acts by inhibiting NF-κB, which is
  responsible for increasing inflammation signaling, and stimulates the expression
  of the BCL-2 family, which has anti-apoptotic activity.
