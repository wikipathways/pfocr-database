caption: The top ten enriched diseases and biological functions of miR-217 according
  to IPA Core Analysis (A). The network of canonical pathways (B) and the most represented
  canonical pathways (C) of miR-217 and its target genes, according to IPA Core Analysis.
  Grey bars represent pathways with no activity predicted due to a lack of information
  in the Ingenuity Pathway Knowledge Base (IPKB), despite highly significant association
  between genes and pathway. White bars represent pathways with z-score of 0, pointing
  out that differentially expressed genes did not indicate an evident prediction of
  activation or inhibition.
