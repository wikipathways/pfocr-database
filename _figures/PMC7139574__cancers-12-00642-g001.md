caption: Biological pathways involved in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis
  and harboring therapeutic implications. (i) Venetoclax (in red) binds and inhibits
  the BCL2 anti-apoptotic protein, which is frequently impaired by a variety of molecular
  mechanisms (e.g., del13q14), thus restoring the apoptosis in CLL cells. (ii) Bruton’s
  tyrosine kinase (BTK), a pivotal kinase located downstream to the BCR pathway, can
  be targeted by BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib (in red). (iii) The activation of
  the non-canonical NF-κB pathway contributes to cell survival and progression. (iv)
  Notch homolog 1 (NOTCH1) mutations disrupt the PEST domain (in orange) of the NOTCH
  intracellular domain (NICD), leading to constitutive transcription of target genes
  promoting survival and proliferation. (v) The nuclear TP53 and Ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) proteins are involved in the DNA damage response pathway.
