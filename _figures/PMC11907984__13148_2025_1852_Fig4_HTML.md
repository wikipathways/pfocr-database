caption: Details of CBX members regulate PI3K/AKT/mTOR, NF-κB signalling pathways
  in tumours and mechanism. (A) CBX2 could transcriptionally regulate PI3K/AKT signalling
  pathway activation in BC and GBM through classical PRC1-dependent pathway, playing
  a role in tumour promotion, other mechanisms might exist. In addition, it was found
  that CBX8 recognized H3K27me3 of downstream target genes in PC cells, but did not
  play a transcriptional inhibitory role, there were other ways to transcriptionally
  activate the expression of downstream target genes (the specific mechanism is still
  unclear) to regulate the activation of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and play a role
  in tumour promotion. CBX3 has transcriptional activation in ccRCC/PCa (the specific
  mechanism is still unclear), which could increase the transcriptional activity of
  downstream target genes, regulate the activation of PI3K/AKT signalling pathway,
  and play a role in tumour promotion. In UBC, CBX7 could transcriptively silence
  the expression of downstream target genes in a classical PRC1-dependent manner,
  inhibit the activation of PI3K-AKT signalling pathway, play a role as a tumour-suppressive
  factor, and delay the malignant progression of tumours. (B) The transcriptional
  regulation mechanism of oncogenic factor CBX4 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB
  signalling pathway activation in NSCLC/OS cells. CBX6 could exert transcriptional
  activation independently of the classical PRC1-dependent pathway (the specific mechanism
  is not yet clear), upregulate the expression of downstream target genes, promote
  the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway in HCC, and play a role as a carcinogenic
  factor. Although CBX7 acts as a carcinogenic factor in GC, it could still play a
  transcriptional inhibitory role and promote the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway
  in GC, but the specific regulatory mechanism is unknown. CBX6 and CBX7 could inhibit
  the activation of NF-κB signalling pathway in BC/ccRCC cells by silencing the expression
  of downstream target genes through classical PRC1-dependent transcriptional pathway,
  thus acting as a tumour suppressor. CBX7 could transcribe and activate the expression
  of downstream target genes in PC cells independently of the classical PRC1-dependent
  pathway, and the NF-κB signalling pathway is activated to act as a tumour suppressor
