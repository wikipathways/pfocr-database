caption: Schematic of the current working model. Elevated levels of cAMP stimulate
  both PKA type I and type II, but only PKA type I is required to stimulate apical
  bile canalicular lumen development. Previous work has demonstrated that OSM signaling
  but not cAMP stimulates the phosphorylation and activation of p42/44 MAPK and targets
  the regulatory subunit IIα (RIIα) to associate with centrosomes in a manner that
  does not require catalytic activity of PKA (). OSM-MAPK signaling does not activate
  adenylyl cyclase or PKA type I or type II to stimulate apical lumen development.
  However, OSM does require the dissociation and base levels of the activity of PKA
  type I, which feeds in the OSM signaling pathway downstream of OSM-stimulated p42/44
  MAPK phosphorylation. BL, basolateral; AC, adenylyl cyclase; GSα, G protein Sα;
  the asterisk indicates activated PKA type.
