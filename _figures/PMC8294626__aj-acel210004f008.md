caption: Notch/Wnt signaling pathways. Notch signaling is initiated by ligand binding
  to Notch receptor (1) leading to receptor endocytosis (2). The receptor is cleaved
  by γ-secretase in a V-ATPase-dependent manner (3) allowing the cytoplasmic domain
  to translocate to the nucleus (4) and activate target genes (5). Inhibition of V-ATPase-mediated
  acidification with bafilomycin blocks this process. Furthermore, V-ATPase-dependent
  lysosomal degradation of the receptor decreases Notch signaling. Wnt signaling is
  initiated by Wnt ligand binding to the Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein (LRP)
  receptors (1) leading to internalization of the receptors into V-ATPase-containing
  endosomes where they associate with the V-ATPase via the ATP6AP2 accessory protein
  (2). A multiprotein signaling pathway then inhibits a “destruction complex” that
  normally degrades β-catenin, leading to an increase in cytoplasmic accumulation
  and translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus (3), where it activates target genes
  (4). Created with BioRender.com.
