caption: Downstream signaling pathways activated by metabotropic glutamate receptors
  (mGluR). mGluR family comprises eight subtypes subdivided in three groups according
  their sequence homology, pharmacology, and second messenger signaling pathway association.
  Group I mGluR are coupled to Gq proteins and their activation stimulates phospholipase
  C (PLC) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis. PIP2 hydrolysis
  generates inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which stimulates
  intracellular Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum and activates protein kinase
  C (PKC), respectively. In contrast, mGluR of group II and III are coupled predominantly
  to Gi/o proteins and classically related to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC)
  and directly regulate ion channel activity and other downstream signaling partners
  via liberation of Gβγ subunits.
