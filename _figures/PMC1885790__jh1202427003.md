caption: Diagram illustrating how the Rb and p53 pathways are linked to form a complex
  tumor suppressor network. Rb regulates the cell cycle by arresting cells in G1 phase.
  Rb can be temporarily inactivated to allow cell division by phosphorylation of the
  protein. Pathological inactivation of the Rb pathway can result from direct mutation
  of the Rb gene, or from inappropriate phosphorylation of Rb because of disruption
  of upstream regulators. The ARF-MDM2 axis links the Rb and p53 pathways and can
  trigger apoptosis as a result of uncontrolled proliferation. Thus, most cancers
  acquire mutations in both pathways during malignant progression to evade cell cycle
  control and apoptosis. Proteins in red were analyzed in this study. See text for
  details.
