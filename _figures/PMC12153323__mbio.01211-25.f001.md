caption: Comparison of iron acquisition, storage, and use by select pathogenic fungi
  and mammals. Pathogenic fungi have evolved methods of iron acquisition to facilitate
  growth in the host, including host-heme utilization, siderophore iron scavenging,
  and the reductive iron assimilation pathway, which includes ferric reductase, iron
  permease, and ferroxidase. Fungi store iron in vacuoles or specific storage siderophores.
  Mammals primarily obtain iron through dietary sources, but recycling strategies
  include senescent erythrocyte endocytosis and heme/hemoglobin recycling through
  CD91 and CD163, respectively. Mammals regulate iron through transferrin and ferritin,
  which can prevent iron from being used by microbes, although fungal siderophores
  have been shown to be able to scavenge iron from transferrin
