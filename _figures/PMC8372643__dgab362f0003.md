caption: 'HIF1α-PFKFB3 signaling in neurodegeneration. Oxidative stress and extracellular
  glutamate (yellow dots) accumulation are 2 critical mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration
  in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Under physiological conditions, glucose metabolism
  in neurons is directed to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to maintain their
  antioxidant status. This process is accomplished by high APC/C-Cdh1 activity in
  neurons, in which ubiquitinated PFKFB3 is continuously degraded and its biologic
  mediator F2,6P2 is suppressed. During stress in DR, PFKFB3 is activated by HIF1α
  leading to reduced PPP. Besides, NMDAR overstimulated by extracellular glutamate
  accumulation inhibits APC/C-Cdh1 and upregulates PFKFB3; the latter enhances glycolytic
  flux, which is detrimental to neurons, thus corroborating neurodegeneration. In
  addition to neurons, hyperactivated astrocytes (gliosis) overexpress various proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines (blue dots), thus compromising the integrity of the blood-retinal
  barrier and promoting neurodegeneration. Abbreviations: APC/C-Cdh1, anaphase-promoting
  complex/cyclosome; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; F1,6P2, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  F2,6P2, fructose-2,6-biphosphate 2; FBPase1, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase 1; G6P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; HIF1, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α transcription complex; HRE,
  hypoxia response element; NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
