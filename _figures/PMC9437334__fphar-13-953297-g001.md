caption: The alterations of serum metabolites and key metabolic pathways in acute-on-chronic
  liver failure (ACLF). Glycogenolysis (liver), proteolysis (mainly muscles), lipolysis
  (adipose tissue), and bacterial translocation (gut) are induced in the context of
  ACLF, resulting in the release of glucose, amino acids, fatty acids and gut microbiota-associated
  metabolites. During PAMP-induced systemic inflammation, glucose is used for promptly
  producing ATP through glycolysis and enters the pentose phosphate pathway that is
  involved in nucleotide synthesis, while mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) is suppressed; Mitochondrial β-oxidation of FAs is inhibited and blood
  level of fatty acylcarnitines is increased; Increased generation and accumulation
  of many blood amino acid metabolites are involved in various amino acid metabolism.
  AA, arachidonic acid; EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG,
  oxidized glutathione; LOX, lipoxygenase; LT, leukotriene; LX, lipoxin; OXPHOS, oxidative
  phosphorylation; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
