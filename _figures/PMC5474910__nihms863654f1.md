caption: In animal models, the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) is one such brain region
  that has been shown to regulate dopamine signaling via a polysynaptic pathway from
  the nucleus accumbens (nAcc) to the ventral pallidum (VP), and ultimately to dopamine
  cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA, ). Activation of the vHipp by the glutamate
  agonist NMDA, has been shown to activate dopamine neurons in the VTA, resulting
  in an increase in the number of spontaneously active cells and extracellular dopamine.
  Administration of a glutamate antagonists into the nAcc blocks the increase in dopamine
  population activity caused by vHipp activation, suggesting that the vHipp sends
  glutamatergic projections to the nAcc. The nAcc then sends inhibitory GABAergic
  projections to VP, and bicuculline (GABAA antagonist) injections into this brain
  region also block the increase in dopamine population activity induced by vHipp
  activation. Further, inactivation of the ventral pallidum by muscimol/baclofen increased
  dopamine population activity, suggesting that under normal conditions, the VP maintains
  an inhibitory influence over the VTA. Therefore, the vHipp can act through a multisynaptic
  pathway to regulate dopamine neuron population activity.
