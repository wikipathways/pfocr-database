caption: Laboratory evolution under a defined selective pressure has identified a
  few cases in which a new metabolic function arose. Three of these examples include
  the ability that E. coli gained to (a) transport citrate after 33,000 generations,
  (b) metabolize L-1,2-propanediol and ethylene glycol, and (c) synthesize glutathione
  when a key enzyme in its synthesis was deleted.
