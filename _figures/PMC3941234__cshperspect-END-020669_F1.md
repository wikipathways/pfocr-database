caption: Endocytosis in neurons. (A) Upon ligand binding, Trk receptors are activated
  and recruit PI3 kinase, Ras/MAPK, and PLC-γ to initiate downstream signaling pathways.
  (B) Internalization of neurotrophin/Trk complexes can occur via clathrin-dependent
  mechanisms to give rise to early endosomes, or via macropinocytosis, which gives
  rise to multivesicular bodies (MVBs). (C) The endosomal pathway involves maturation
  from early endosomes associated with Rab5 to late endosomes associated with Rab7.
  Vesicles are degraded in lysosomes or can be recycled back to the membrane through
  association with Rab11. (D) In neurons, endosomes are trafficked long distances
  along the axon by dynein-mediated retrograde transport toward the cell body, or
  by kinesin-mediated anterograde transport toward the distal axon.
