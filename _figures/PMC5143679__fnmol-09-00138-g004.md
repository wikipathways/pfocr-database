caption: Tissue concentrations of metabolites belonging to the methionine metabolism,
  including the methionine cycle and the trans-sulfuration pathway, in different regions
  of the adult human cerebral cortex. All metabolites were measured with TQMS. ∗p
  < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001. a, significant differences with respect to entorhinal
  cortex; b, significant differences with respect to hippocampus.
