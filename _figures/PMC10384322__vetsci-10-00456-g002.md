caption: 'Viral infections and ferroptosis. (a) The HIV-1 virus is an example to demonstrate
  the viral life cycle. The typical viral life cycle can be summarized in four stages:
  entry into the host cell, viral replication, viral assembly, and release. During
  viral infections, cells trigger ferroptosis in several ways, for example, by expanding
  LIP, producing excess ROS, decreasing GSH content, and down-regulating GPX4 activity;
  (b) LIP expansion comes from two aspects: limiting iron ion efflux and increasing
  intracellular free iron levels. IL-6 and TLR4 pathways increase Hepcidin synthesis
  and restrict iron ion efflux. Viruses, such as HCV and NWAVs, specifically recognize
  TfR1 and increase cellular iron uptake. Additional processes, including degradation
  of iron-rich organelles, ferritin autophagy and other pathways, can also increase
  LIP levels. Some viruses use iron to assist in their replication: HIV-1 uses an
  iron-containing ATP-binding enzyme ATPase ABCE1 to assemble the capsid, and SARS-CoV-2
  uses Fe-S clusters to make up the protein; (c) in concern of immunity, macrophages
  specifically recognize and engulf ferroptosis cells. Conversely, ferroptotic cells
  can influence the polarization of macrophages. Neutrophils form NETs, which induce
  ferroptosis and thus fight pathogens. GPX4 can contribute to the development of
  lymphocytes. GPX4 helps T cells to fight against some pathogens, but, during GPX4
  deficiency, it instead induces ferroptosis in T cells. B1 and MZB cells need GPX4
  to maintain and perform immune functions; (d) GPX4 is essential for STING activation.
  The cGAS-STING pathway recognizes viral cell DNA. HIV reduces the intracellular
  GSH level and or affects GPX4 activities. JE inhibits the expression of systemic
  Xc-. Abbreviations: NETs, neutrophil extracellular traps; JE, Japanese encephalitis
  virus.'
