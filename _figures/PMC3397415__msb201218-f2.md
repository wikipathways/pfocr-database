caption: A model for transcriptional regulation by the pheromone response pathway.
  The elements of the pathway considered in the simple model are indicated in red.
  Components of the pathway leading to filamentation gene transcription are indicated
  in orange. Black arrows indicate transitions between the depicted complexes. Blue
  arrows indicate transitions that are accelerated by ppFus3-dependent phosphorylation.
  Green arrows indicate positive feedback loops, resulting in transcription of more
  Ste12 or Tec1. The empty set φ indicates component degradation.
