caption: 'Nrf-2 and signaling pathways. In classical TLRs/NF-κB signal transduction,
  TLR activates the TAK1-TAB1 kinase complex, leading to the synergistic release of
  NF-κB dimers and IκB phosphorylation by the IKK complex. However, the activation
  of Nrf-2 can inhibit the phosphorylation of IκB in the typical NF-κB pathway, thereby
  reducing the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB dimers and inhibiting the expression
  of downstream immune response genes, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, and COX-2.
  Activation of the TGF-β1/Smad pathway leads to a disturbance in the steady-state
  microenvironment, essential for promoting FMD and EMT processes. Activation of Nrf-2
  specifically blocks these two processes and protects against pulmonary fibrosis.Abbreviations:
