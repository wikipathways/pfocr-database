caption: Phosphatidylcholine (PC) containing an sn-2 unsaturated fatty acid can be
  oxidized by H2O2 (+Fe2+) to PC hydroperoxide (PCOOH). To restore the normal state,
  the hydroperoxide can be reduced by the phospholipid hydroperoxide GSH peroxidase
  (PHGPx) activity of Prdx6 to the PC alcohol that is then reduced to the sulfhydryl.
  An alternative pathway for removal of PCOOH is hydrolysis at the sn-2 position mediated
  by Prdx6 PLA2 activity to generate lysoPC plus fatty acyl hydroperoxide; lysoPC
  can be reacylated with an acyl CoA substrate by the LPCAT activity of Prdx6 to regenerate
  the reduced phospholipid. Enzymes responsible for reduction of the PC alcohol (PCOH)
  and fatty acid hydroperoxide (FAOOH) that result from these reactions are not shown.
