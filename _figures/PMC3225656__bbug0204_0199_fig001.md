caption: Model of the glucose sensing network of S. cerevisiae in the context of a
  cellodextrin transport pathway. Glucose is sensed by both extracellular and intracellular
  systems. Extracellular glucose is sensed by the 7-transmembrane protein, Gpr1, as
  well as the non-transporting transceptors, Snf3 and Rgt2. Intracellular glucose,
  which can enter through the hexose transport system (Hxt), is sensed by a pathway
  that involves Hxk2. Signals emanating from Gpr1 and intracellular glucose converge
  to induce a genome-wide transcriptional response through the Ras/PKA pathway, which
  includes adenylate cyclase (Cyr1) and protein kinase A (Tpk1, Tpk2, Tpk3). Signals
  emanating from Snf3 and Rgt2 modulate the expression of various hexose transporters
  through Std1 and Mth1. A cellodextrin transport pathway would likely bypass Gpr1,
  Snf3 or Rgt2, but may activate the Ras/PKA pathway following transport and hydrolysis
  of cellodextrins. This figure is a simplified model adapted from Rolland et al.
