caption: Arterial-venous and lymphatic specification in vertebrate embryo. Due to
  secretion of sonic hedgehog from the notochord VEGF expression is induced in adjacent
  somites. In nearby ECs VEGF leads to FoxC1 and FoxC2 mediated upregulation of components
  of the Notch signalling pathway (Notch-1 and DLL4). Thereupon Hey1/2 are expressed
  which, in addition to Sox7, Sox17 and Sox18, lead to arterial specification and
  EphrinB2 marker expression. COUP-TFII is responsible for suppression of Nrp1 expression
  and inhibits Notch signalling which leads to venous differentiation with the marker
  expression of Nrp2 and EphB4. Later on some venous ECs of the anterior cardinal
  vein begin to express Sox18 that precedes expression of Prox-1 and COUP-TFII. Prox-1
  induces expression of lymphatic markers like podoplanin and is the major mediator
  for LECs specification. Modified from ().
