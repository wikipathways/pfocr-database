caption: Modulation of the glucocorticoid receptor and nitric oxide signaling pathways.
  a Graphical representation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) pathway was performed
  through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The relative modulation of gene expression between
  burn patients and healthy volunteers (HV) is color coded from green (the gene is
  less expressed in patients with burns) to red (the gene is more expressed in patients
  with burns). b, c To focus on the effect of hydrocortisone administration, a zoom
  was performed on the targets of the glucocorticoid receptor, according to analysis
  1 (placebo-treated burn patients vs. HV (b)) or analysis 2 (hydrocortisone-treated
  patients vs. placebo-treated patients (c)). d Summary of the effect of hydrocortisone
  administration on the gene expression for the nitric oxide mediated signal transduction
  pathway [GO:0007263] in HV (green), hydrocortisone-treated patients (red) or placebo-treated
  patients (blue). Statistical significance of the observed differences was assessed
  using repeated measures analysis of variance taking into account treatment, time
  and gene (probes) effects. We observed significant modulation over time (p value < 10
  -6), and according to hydrocortisone administration (p value < 10 -6). S1 to S4
  sample times day 0, day 1, day 5 and day 7, respectively
