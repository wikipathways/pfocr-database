caption: (A) Diagram depicting the hypoxia signaling pathway. In normoxic conditions,
  HIF1/3 becomes prolyl hydroxylated which leads to dimer formation with VHL that
  shuttles the complex to proteasomal degradation. In hypoxia, HIF1/3 is more stable
  and translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of target genes with ARNT
  as a co-factor. (B) Diagram depicting the circadian pathway in this study of oligodendrogliomas.
  ARNT and ARNTL heterodimerize with CLOCK to initiate transcription of genes. Genes
  PER1/2, CRY1/2, and REV-ERBs are transduced and inhibit the CLOCK complex in a negative
  feedback loop. CREB3L3 is targeted by the ARTNL/CLOCK complex, which acts as a transcription
  factor to upregulate its own target genes. Figure generated using BioRender.
