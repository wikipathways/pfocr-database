caption: Schematic representation of signaling pathway during infection. During infection,
  upd/JAK/STAT triggers the expression of ImpL2 in muscles leading to the local suppression
  of insulin signaling. This allows for the redirection of nutrients away from muscles,
  in favor of the immune system. Disruption in the upd/JAK/STAT signaling pathway,
  through genetic manipulation means insulin resistance in muscles does not occur
  and therefore the immune system does not acquire sufficient nutrients to mount an
  effective immune response
