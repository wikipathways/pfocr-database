caption: Mitochondria and neurotrophic hypothesis in MDD pathophysiology. Chronic
  stress affects neuronal plasticity through decreased availability and transcription
  of neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF enhances
  mitochondrial activity through a bcl-2-dependent pathway. Loss of signalling by
  BDNF reduces neuronal plasticity and induces apoptosis. Mitochondria provide the
  substrate for formation of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is required for various
  epigenetic modulations within the cell including of the genes responsible for neuronal
  plasticity. The density of astrocytes is also reduced in MDD individuals thereby
  affecting glutamine-glutamate ratio. Astrocytes transfer glutamine to the neurons,
  which is reconverted to glutamate by the mitochondrial glutaminase-2.
