caption: Depiction of the labeling of metabolites resulting from labeled xylose. Shown
  is the stable isotope introduction into the central carbon metabolism of P. putida
  KT2440. Orange lines indicate the Dahms pathway, green lines indicate the Weimberg
  pathway, and dashed lines indicate several enzymatic steps. Orange dots indicate
  the labeling resulting from the Dahms pathway and green dots indicate the labeling
  resulting from the Weimberg pathway.
