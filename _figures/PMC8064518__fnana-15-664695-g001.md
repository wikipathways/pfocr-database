caption: Schematic diagram of the canonical PI3K-mTOR and GATOR1 signaling pathway
  and mTORC1-independent pathways. (Left) The canonical PI3K-mTOR signaling pathway,
  the GATOR1 complex, and several mTORC1 downstream effectors are shown. mTORC1 regulates
  mRNA translation and protein synthesis via direct phosphorylation of S6K1/2 and
  4E-BP1/2. mTORC1 also regulates energy metabolism and autophagy, as well as other
  processes not shown here. (Right, top) A summary of the PI3K-mTOR and GATOR1 gene
  variants discussed in this review is depicted. These variants converge on mTORC1
  hyperactivation, leading to cortical mislamination, neuron dysmorphogenesis, and
  epilepsy. (Right, bottom) The three mTORC1-independent pathways that are discussed
  in this review and the associated phenotypes are depicted.
