caption: Proposed model for MBP-induced abnormal cell growth of juvenile SCs. MBP
  at 0.1 mM inhibits the expression of Peli2, leading to K63 ubiquitination of IRAK1,
  which activates the MAPK/JNK signalling pathway and promotes SC proliferation. MBP
  at 10 mM led to SC apoptosis through intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathways
papertitle: Dibutyl phthalate promotes juvenile Sertoli cell proliferation by decreasing
  the levels of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 2.
