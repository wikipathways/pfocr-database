caption: '(A) Schematic showing signaling interactions between 5-HT1A and GRPR. Co-activation
  of 5-HT1A and GRPR amplifies Gq-coupled PLCβ-dependent signaling pathway, resulting
  in the release of Ca2+ from ER through SERCA pumps. ER: endoplasmic reticulum.(B)
  Schematic that illustrates the vicious ISC. Scratching induces skin inflammation,
  which in turn induces more vicious itching attacks.(C) Schematic of dual modulation
  of descending 5-HT signaling in pain and itch during the ISC. Scratching evokes
  inflammatory/mechanical pain, which results in the activation of 5-HT neurons in
  NRM of the brainstem. Descending release of 5-HT acts on two distinct subpopulations
  of neurons: one expressing 5-HT1A alone (green cells) that inhibits nociceptive
  processing, while the other expressing both 5-HT1A and GRPR (blue cells) that facilitates
  pruriceptive transmission. NRM: nucleus raphe magnus.'
