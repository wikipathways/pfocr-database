caption: Schematic representation of the main pathways perturbed under different stresses
  as observed in the flux balance analysis (FBA) results. Up and down arrows beside
  the pathways’ name represent up-regulation and down-regulation respectively for
  that pathway. Arrow color code represents different stress conditions. Dashed arrows
  indicate multiple pathways between given two pathways. “★” shows maximum release
  of ammonia through asparaginase pathway under acid stress. PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
  kinase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; KatG, catalase; METS, methionine synthase; METAT,
  methionine adenosyltransferase; CYTBD, cytochrome oxidase; ASN, aspargine; ASP,
  aspartate. Refer to  for detail of reactions involved in the perturbed pathways.
  We have not included iron stress in this figure since there were no substantial
  changes observed.
