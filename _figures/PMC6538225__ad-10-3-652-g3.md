caption: Pathophysiological implications of C1q in neurodegenerative diseases. C1q
  is involved in the pathological pathway in each neurodegenerative disease due to
  its role in abnormal protein aggregate clearance, astrocyte reactivation, binding
  and activation of microglia, or inflammatory responses. C1q in the age-dependent
  onset time of each neurodegenerative disease participates in regulating disease
