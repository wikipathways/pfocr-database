caption: A schematic of the nucleotide sugar biosynthesis pathway showing the relative
  levels of specific metabolites in rice leaves infected with Puccinia striiformis
  f. sp. tritici (Pst) (blur bar) or mock-inoculated leaves (purple bar) at 48 and
  120 hours post inoculation (hpi), and the relative transcription levels of selected
  genes at 24, 48, and 120 hpi. Metabolite peak intensities (n = 3, average ± SD)
  are depicted on the primary y axis. Asterisks indicate statistically significant
  differences compared to the mock controls using two-sided Student’s t-test. (*P < 0.05,
  **P < 0.01). The heatmap represents changes in transcript level of genes encoding
  enzymes involved in nucleotide sugar metabolism as log2(fold change) in comparison
  with the controls. Enzymes catalyze the biochemical reaction are indicated in white
  text in green box. Glc-6P, Glucose 6-phosphate; Glc-1P, Glucose-1-phosphate; UDP-GlcA,
  UDP-glucuronic acid; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; UGP, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases;
  UGT, UDP-glucosyl transferase; UGDH, UDP-glucose-6-dehydrogenase; UXS, UDP-glucuronic
  acid decarboxylase
