caption: The role of E3s and DUBs in NAFLD-related ERS, mitochondrial malfunction,
  and lipid autophagy. (1) E3 ubiquitin ligases CHIP and Nedd4L can ubiquitinate and
  degrade TXNIP in the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway, inhibiting liver lipid
  deposition, inflammation, and fibrosis. TRIB3 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM8
  to degrade HNF4α and prevent NAFLD. E3 ubiquitin ligase Gp78 catalyzes the ubiquitination
  and degradation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, relieving endoplasmic
  reticulum stress and inhibiting NASH and HCC. (2) The deubiquitinase USP14 deubiquitinates
  both FASN and HSP90AA1, boosting TG production and mitochondrial dysfunction, aggravating
  liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Miz1, which promotes mitochondrial
  autophagy, can be degraded by ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting mitochondrial autophagy
  and exacerbating NASH. (3) HMGB1 promotes lipid autophagy, degrades lipid droplets,
  and helps to avoid NAFLD. In NAFLD, HMGB1 can be ubiquitinated and degraded by E3
  ubiquitin ligase RNF186, thereby promoting the development of NAFLD
