caption: Signaling pathways in innate recognition of fungal pathogens and differentiation
  of CD4+ T helper cells. (A) Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed
  by fungi are recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including
  toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) [e.g., dendritic cell
  (DC)-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), Dectin-1, Dectin-2, MINCLE,
  and mannose receptor] and complement receptor 3 (CR3). TLRs and CLRs activate multiple
  intracellular signaling pathways upon binding to specific fungal PAMPs, including
  β-glucans, chitin, O-linked mannan and N-linked mannan, and nucleic acids. These
  signals activate canonical or non-canonical nuclear factor-κB and the NOD-, LRR-
  and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The integration of simultaneously
  activated PRRs occurs at the level of intracellular adaptors and transcription factors
  shared between overlapping pathways. The resulting cytokine responses shape the
  activation of adaptive immune response. Induction of IL-12 drives IFN-γ production
  by T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, which is crucial for phagocyte activation. Induction
  of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-23 promotes Th17 differentiation. Regulatory T-cells (Treg)
  act as host-driven homeostatic response to keep inflammation under control. (B)
  Th1 and Th17 differentiation. Polarization of naive T cells into Th1 leads to IFNγ
  production, and its signaling is mediated through the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) pathway, leading to transcription
  of IFNγ-inducible genes. IL-6 and IL-21 upregulate the expression of the retinoic
  acid-related orphan receptor RORγt and RORα, leading to expression of the inducible
  component of the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and further Th17 development. IL-17A and
  IL-17F produced by Th17 cells augments neutrophil production in the bone marrow
  and their recruitment to the site of infection. IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 promote
  production of antimicrobial peptides in epithelial cells. Molecules in which genetic
  defects have been identified to be associated with increased susceptibility to endemic
  mycoses are marked in bold red.
