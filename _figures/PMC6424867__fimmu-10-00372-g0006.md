caption: Arenaviral proteins (NP and Z) inhibit the RIG-I/MDA5 and NF-κB pathways.
  RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by PAMP dsRNAs during virus replication and are potentiated
  by PACT. Following the activation of MAVS (on the mitochondria) by RIG-I/MDA5, a
  molecular cascade involves the interaction of IKKε and DDX3, which is followed by
  phosphorylation of the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 to translocate them into
  the nucleus, where they dimerize and bind to transcription factor binding sites
  of the IFNα and IFNβ genes to activate their transcriptions. Expression and exportation
  of these gene products into the cellular milieu trigger the IFN1 signaling cascade
  in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to induce expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs) and inflammatory genes to confer virus resistance. The NF-κB pathway
  is activated by recognition of certain features of the virus particles by the membrane
  receptors TLR 2 or TLR 6. This initiates a molecular cascade resulting in the translocation
  of the two functional NF-κB units (p50 and p65) into the nucleus, resulting in more
  production of NF-κB. Arenaviral proteins (NP or Z shown in red) are known to inhibit
  different steps of the RIG-I/MDA5 and NF-κB pathways by either degrading the PAMP
  dsRNAs (through the NP RNase function) or directly inhibiting the normal function
  of different cellular proteins (RIG-I, MDA5, PACT, IKKε, or p50/p65).
