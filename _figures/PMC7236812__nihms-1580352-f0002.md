caption: Tumor suppressive and normal tissue protective potential of CDK4/6 inhibitors.
  CDK4/6 inhibitors activate RB/E2F signaling pathway and targets cell cycle machinery
  and induces apoptosis and cellular senescence. Additionally, CDK4/6 inhibitors involved
  maintaining genome stability by DNA repair mechanisms via RB dependent mechanism.
  CDK4/6 inhibition induces anti-tumor immunity and offers vital organ/cell protection,
  differentiation and myogenesis against cancer therapy induced toxicity.
