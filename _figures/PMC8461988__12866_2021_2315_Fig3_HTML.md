caption: Gut microbiota produce various metabolites that are involved in the development
  and progression of cancer. Polyamines play important roles in translation, gene
  regulation, stress resistance, antitumor immunity suppression, cell proliferation,
  invasion, and metastasis. Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) generated by intestinal
  microbiota, such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate can maintain microbiota homeostasis
  and the intestinal barrier integrity. Butyrate produced by gut microbiota can suppress
  inflammation and carcinogenesis by blocking the signaling pathway of NFKB activation.
  Butyrate can induce the differentiation of regulatory T cells and IL10-producing
  T cells. Butyrate also acts as a histone deacetylase and leads to the inhibition
  of cell proliferation, stimulation of apoptosis, and suppression of tumor development
