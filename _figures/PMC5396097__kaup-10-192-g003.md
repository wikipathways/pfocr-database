caption: Figure 3. Schematic diagram of signaling pathways for tumor-derived factors
  contributing to macrophage polarization via induction of autophagy. Expression of
  IL6 and CCL2 in the tumor microenvironment is regulated in a reciprocal manner.
  Induction of autophagy triggered by binding of IL6 and CCL2 to IL6R (interleukin
  6 receptor) and CCR2 (chemokine [C–C motif] receptor 2), respectively, is essential
  for macrophage polarizaton to the M2 phenotype. Following binding to TLR2, the hepatoma-derived
  factors are able to stimulate macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype by controlling
  NFKB homeostasis through selective autophagy. Moreover, M2 macrophages can be induced
  by autophagy triggered by LPS or bacteria, which is modulated by the MTOR pathway
  via activation of TLR4.
