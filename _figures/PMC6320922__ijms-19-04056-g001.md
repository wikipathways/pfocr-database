caption: The Drosophila Jak/STAT signaling components and the corresponding human
  homologs and their protein families. Interleukin or cytokine (the Upd family in
  flies) binds to its signaling receptor (Dome in flies), which activates the associated
  Jak (fly Hop) and triggers a chain of events. Activated Jak phosphorylates other
  Jaks and the receptor, creating a binding site for STAT proteins. Recruited STAT
  proteins (fly STAT92E), are then phosphorylated. The phospho-STATs dimerize and
  translocate to the nucleus. The STAT DNA binding domain recognizes promoter and
  enhancer regions of target genes, resulting in their transcriptional activation.
  The table above the figure lists the core components of the canonical pathway. The
  table to the right delineates key regulators of the fly Jak/STAT pathway, their
  respective human homologs, and their protein families. Positive regulators are listed
  in green font, negative regulators are in red. See text for details.
