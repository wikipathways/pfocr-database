caption: 'Oxidative stress in asthma airway remodeling. In asthma, eosinophils and
  airway epithelial cells are the main source of the profibrotic cytokine TGF-β, which
  can stimulate ROS production by activating membrane-related oxidase and inhibiting
  antioxidant enzymes. TGF-β can induce the activity of NAPDH oxidase (NOX) through
  a variety of signaling pathways, including the SMAD pathway, PI3K pathway, and MAPK
  pathway, and inhibit the expression of GSH, SOD, and other antioxidant enzymes.
  Furthermore, TGF-β can regulate autophagy by the PI3K pathway, which is crucial
  for the activation of myofibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. GSH: glutathione;
  SOD: superoxide dismutase; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; NOS2: nitric
  oxide synthase 2; NO: nitric oxide.'
