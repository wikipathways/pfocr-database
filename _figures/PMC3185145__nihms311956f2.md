caption: Oral epithelial cells are able to discriminate between the two morphological
  forms of C. albicans via the MAPK pathway using a biphasic response. In the first
  response, a colonising yeast cell is recognised by an as yet undetermined Pattern
  Recognition Receptor (PRR) resulting in activation of the NF-κB pathway and weak,
  early and transient activation of all three MAPK pathways (p38, ERK1/2 and JNK).
  This results in activation of p65/p50 heterodimer transcription factor activity
  (NF-κB) and activation of c-Jun DNA binding via the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways. What
  role, if any, is played by p38 at this point is unknown. Hyphal cells present at
  low dose also activate this first response. In the second phase, when in sufficient
  quantities, C. albicans hyphae are recognised by an unknown mechanism that results
  in continued activation of the NF-κB pathway along with further, stronger activation
  of the MAPK pathways – in particular p38 and ERK1/2. Activation of p38 leads to
  activation of the c-Fos transcription factor, which, in conjunction with the p65/p50
  NF-κB heterodimers, results in upregulation of cytokine and inflammatory mediator
  expression. At the same time, activation of ERK1/2 signalling results in stabilisation
  of the MKP1 phosphatase, which targets p38 and JNK to deactivate them, hence acting
  as part of a negative feedback loop and preventing a potentially deleterious over-reaction
  of the immune system.
