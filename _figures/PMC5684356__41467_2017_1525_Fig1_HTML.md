caption: Analytical procedure. Starting from the IgG glycan abundances measured using
  LC-ESI-MS (1), we calculated a correlation-based network (2) and mapped it to the
  known IgG glycosylation pathway (3). We found that most edges in the network corresponded
  to single enzymatic steps in the pathway (4). Based on this finding, we inferred
  unknown enzymatic reactions that were putatively involved in the synthesis of IgG
  glycans using a rule-based approach (5). We then replicated the findings using four
  cohorts (6) and performed different in vitro validation experiments to confirm the
  predicted reactions (7)
