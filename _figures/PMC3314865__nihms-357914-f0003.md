caption: Multiple acquired (shown in green) and intrinsic (shown in pink) mechanisms
  of BRAF inhibitor resistance have been identified. Chronic BRAF inhibition can lead
  to activation of the MAPK pathway through acquisition of secondary NRAS Q61K mutations,
  RAF isoform (ARAF>BRAF>CRAF) signal switching, truncation of BRAF to a BRAF inhibitor
  refractory form, MEK1 C121S mutation as well as increased COT expression which has
  been linked to intrinsic as well as acquired resistance. RTK signaling via IGF1R
  and PDGFRb can also activate the MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways. Intrinsic mechanisms
  of resistance have been associated with amplification of cyclin D1 or RB1 inactivation
  allowing cells to continue through the cell cycle. Loss of PTEN and genetic alterations
  in PIK3CA and AKT3 are associated with de novo resistance by increasing PI3K/AKT
  activity while PRKD3 activation can increase both MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling.
