caption: Diagram of working hypothesis illustrating the mechanisms of HO-2-dependent
  excitation to hypoxia (hypoxic hypoxia and NaCN). Hypoxia could potentially activate
  HO-2 by directly affecting the cysteine residues on the heme regulatory motifs (HRMs)
  or by increasing the availability of free heme. Alternatively, the NaCN-induced
  increase in intracellular Ca2+ could enhance HO-2 activity by activating protein
  kinases (PKC/CK2). Activation of the Ca2+-dependent PKC/CK2 pathway increases the
  catalytic activity of HO-2. Activation of HO-2 generates signaling molecules CO
  and biliverdin, which can potentially regulate ion channels (e.g., IK and INa) modulated
  by CO/cGMP or a shift in the redox environment, respectively. The net effect of
  HO-2 activity on these ion channels would be a Vm depolarization in NaCN-excited
  neurons. The Vm depolarization would further increase intracellular Ca2+ to affect
  HO-2 activity. NaCN, sodium cyanide; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PKC, protein kinase
  C; CK2, casein kinase-2; ROS, reactive oxygen species; HO-2, heme oxygenase-2; CO,
  carbon monoxide; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase.
