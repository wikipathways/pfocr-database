caption: The metabolic scrambling of U-13C-glucose entering the Krebs cycle via pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (A) and pyruvate carboxylase (B) showing the pathway by which various
  isotopomers form. The 13C scrambling of labeled U-13C-pyruvate entering the Krebs
  cycle shows that the 1,2,3-13C-glutamate and 1,2,3-13C-aspartate isotopomers only
  form by entry into the Krebs cycle via pyruvate carboxylase, while 4,5-13C-glutamate
  and 3,4-13C-aspartate forms via pyruvate dehydrogenase.
