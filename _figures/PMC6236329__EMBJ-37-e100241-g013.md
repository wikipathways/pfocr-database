caption: Under physiological conditions, activation of lysosomal mTORC1 by amino acids
  or insulin directly stimulates mitochondrial oxidative pathways and (not illustrated
  here) regulates mtDNA synthesis. Insulin‐regulated and amino acid‐regulated mitochondrial
  functions are blocked by AβOs, which stimulate translocation of mTORC1 to PM, where
  mTOR kinase activity triggers cell cycle re‐entry (CCR), a frequent prelude to neuron
  death in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In doing so, AβOs also interfere with NiMA. Thus,
  AβOs initiate two parallel, interconnected pathways that together lead to neuronal
  dysfunction in AD.
