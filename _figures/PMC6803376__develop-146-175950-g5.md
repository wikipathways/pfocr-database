caption: In the presence of the Ter mutation in Dnd1, members of mTOR, Hippo and Bmp/Nodal
  pathways have altered expression, with some transcripts indicated as direct targets
  of DND1. (A) Interactions for mTOR, Hippo and BMP/Nodal signaling pathways based
  primarily on KEGG analysis () with input from primary literature (; ; ; ; ; ; ).
  Genes in pathways showing altered expression are colored blue for depression and
  red for elevation (RNA-seq). Genes that map as transcript targets of DND1 based
  on RIP/RIPseq are boxed in green. (B-D) Graphs for representative genes in pathways.
  (B) Nodal, Cripto, Foxh1 and Gdf3 show strong upregulation, whereas Bmp4 is downregulated
  in the mutant transcriptome data. Gdf1 has a spike in upregulation after E12.5.
  (C) Genes in the Hippo pathway, including Yap1, Ywhag and Csnk1e, are targets of
  DND1 that are upregulated in mutants. (D) Genes mapping as DND1 targets in the mTor
  pathway, including Mtor and Akt3, are downregulated, while the target Rheb is strongly
  upregulated in mutants.
papertitle: The RNA-binding protein DND1 acts sequentially as a negative regulator
  of pluripotency and a positive regulator of epigenetic modifiers required for germ
  cell reprogramming.
