caption: Hypothetical diagram of the possible targets where melatonin may act against
  SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS. SARS-CoV-2 enters neuronal cells through ACE2,
  as the receptor binding domain, and TMPRSS2 for spike protein (s protein) priming.
  Next, SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid triggers clathrin-mediated endocytosis enhancing cytoplasm
  release. Subsequently, the single negative strand RNA [( −)gRNA] synthesized from
  ( +)gRNA template is used to replicate more copies of viral RNAs. Afterwards, subgenomic
  RNAs (sgRNAs) synthesized from the ( +)gRNA template encode viral structural and
  accessory proteins, which are subsequently assembled with newly synthesized viral
  RNAs in the ER and Golgi, followed by budding into the lumen of the ERGIC to form
  new virions. Then, virus particles are transported in secretory vesicles to the
  plasma membrane and released by exocytosis. Furthermore, the entry of SARS-CoV-2
  into neuronal cells may dysregulate mitochondrial metabolism increasing ROS and
  leading to the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. In this regard, melatonin's
  high diffusibility allows it to enter in neuronal cells, it binds to CaM and may
  act on the Ca2+/CaMKII system, regulating the expression of ACE2, modulating the
  linking between endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammatory response and scavenging
  ROS. However, in both MT1/MT2 and α7nAChR receptors, melatonin-mediated signaling
  may influence in reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry. When SARS-CoV-2 infects the CNS, it triggers
  the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (i) TNF-α, which acts by binding to TNFR
  receptor recruiting TRADD. This protein binds to TRAF2 to phosphorylate and activate
  the IKK. Then, IKK complex phosphorylates IKBα, resulting in the translocation of
  NF-κB to the nucleus, where it targets many coding genes for mediators of inflammatory
  responses. (ii) IL-6 induces gene activation in response to cytokine receptor stimulation.
  STAT3 proteins dimerize and translocate to the nucleus. JAK2/STAT3 signaling is
  a crucial link acting as a pivotal mediator of neuroinflammation. (iii) The binding
  of SARS-CoV-2 to the TLR (TLR3/7/9) upregulates the pro-inflammatory transcription
  factor NF-κB and causes the release of pro-IL-1β which is cleaved by caspase-1,
  followed by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Consequently, melatonin may revert these
  pro-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and NF-κB
  translocation. In addition, as an anti-inflammatory agent, melatonin inhibits the
  activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Stimulation (blue colored) or inhibition (red
  colored) by melatonin and SARS-CoV-2 are also shown. Organelles/structures were
  not drawn to scale
