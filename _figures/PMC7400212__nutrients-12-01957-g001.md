caption: 'In (A): Interactions of methionine cycle, folate cycle, transsulfuration
  and methylation pathway. (1) Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)
  by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). SAM serves as methyl-donor in various cellular
  methylations; (2) the pathway of remethylation of Hcy to methionine by (3) folate
  cycle requires the presence of vitamin B12 as coenzyme of the methionine synthase
  reaction that transfers the one-carbon methyl group from 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolates
  (THF). MTHFR: methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase; (4) in the transsulfuration
  pathway, Hcy reacts with serine to form cystathionine converted in cysteine with
  the reaction’s vitamin B6 dependent. Cysteine may be in turn be incorporated into
  glutathione. In (B): γ-glutamyl cycle. Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) transfers glutamyl
  aa from blood into cell where oxoproline and glutamate are formed. Thereafter folylpoly-γ-glutamate
  (FPGS), an ATP-dependent ligase, catalyzes the addition of a polyglutamate tail
  to reduced folates, one glutamate residue after the other.'
