caption: Fatty liver diseases are initiated by aberrant hepatic lipid metabolism,
  and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activation plays beneficial effect against the process through
  inhibiting de novo lipogenesis and increasing fatty acid β-oxidation. Liver steatosis
  is the initial stage of fatty liver diseases, which is characterized by excessive
  triglyceride (TG) deposition as lipid droplets in the liver. Lipid metabolism is
  tightly linked with dietary fat, calorie and alcohol intake, which could be subsequently
  digested and convert to circulating TG-rich chylomicrons, free fatty acid (FFA),
  glucose, insulin and so on. Circulating TG-rich chylomicrons and free fatty acid
  (FFA) could be uptaken by liver through transmembrane proteins. High levels of circulating
  glucose and insulin could stimulate de novo lipogenesis activating transcription
  factors carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol regulatory
  element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), followed by activating their downstream lipogenic
  enzymes including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), stearoyl-CoA
  desaturase-1 (SCD1) and elongase of long chain fatty acids family 6 (ELOVL6) to
  synthesize FFA and TG in the liver. In order to maintain lipid homeostasis, there
  are also two removal pathways for acquired FFA and TG, including metabolizing FFA
  through fatty acid β-oxidation in mitochondria via peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor alpha (PPARα) / peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator
  1 alpha (PGC-1α) signaling, and secreting TG into blood circulation as the form
  of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Under high-fat diet, high-calorie diet and/or
  heavy alcohol intake condition, excessive lipid acquisition usually is stimulated
  through increasing lipid uptake and/or lipogenesis, meanwhile lipid removal pathway
  could also be impaired by decreasing fatty acid β-oxidation and/or VLDL secretion.
  Together, the imbalance of hepatic TG/fatty acids flux acquisition and removal consequently
  cause steatosis in the liver. During the process, SIRT1 activation shows beneficial
  effect through inhibiting lipogenesis by deacetylating SREBP-1c and ChREBP to block
  their downstream lipogenic genes, and increasing fatty acid β-oxidation via deacetylating
  PPARα/PGC-1α, thus rebalances the hepatic lipid hemostasis.
