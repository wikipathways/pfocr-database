caption: 'Heme metabolism. Heme is synthesized from glycine and succinyl-CoA, through
  eight enzymatic steps that take place in the cytoplasm and the mitochondrion. Heme
  and heme precursors are transported between these compartments by ANT and Abcb6,
  respectively. In addition to the heme produced via this pathway, extracellular heme
  can be imported. Hemoproteins can be taken up and denatured in endosomes, liberating
  heme that can be transported to the cytoplasm via HRG-1, whereas cell-free heme
  is taken up by the cell membrane-associated HCP1. Cytoplasmic heme can be scavenged
  by PRX1, which neutralizes its pro-oxidant effects. Excess heme can be exported
  via FLVCR and Bcrp/Abcg2 or catabolized by HO-1/2 into equimolar amounts of BV,
  CO and free Fe. BV can be converted into BR by BVR while labile cellular Fe induces
  the expression of FtH that scavenges excess cellular Fe. Abbreviations: Abcb6, ATP-binding
