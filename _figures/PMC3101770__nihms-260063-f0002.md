caption: IMD signaling pathway. This pathway is preferentially triggered by DAP-type
  peptidoglycan, common to Gram-negative bacteria and certain Gram-positives, especially
  Bacillus spp. DAP-type peptidoglycan can be recognized by different receptors, depending
  on its location and size. Large insoluble peptidoglycan is recognized on the cell
  surface by PGRP-LCx, while smaller peptidoglycan fragments, like TCT, can be recognized
  at the cell surface by a ligand-induced dimer of PGRP-LCx and PGRP-LCa. In addition,
  DAP-type peptidoglycan that reaches the cytosol can trigger another receptor, PGRP-LE.
  Both PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE trigger a similar intracellular signal transduction pathway,
  as outlined here, that culminates in the activation of the NF-κB precursor Relish.
  In addition, recognition of intracellular DAP-type peptidoglycan by PGRP-LE also
  triggers an autophagic response, which is important in the protection against intracellular
  bacteria.
