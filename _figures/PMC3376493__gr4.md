caption: 'Hypothesized Pathway for Mandibular Patterning Associated with Mutations
  in the Endothelin-DLX5/6 PathwaySeveral reports support the premise that mutations
  in the endothelin pathway cause homeotic transformation of the lower (ventral) jaw
  to a maxillary (dorsal) identity. Mutations in mice of Edn1, Ednra, the G protein
  αq subunit, Dlx5/Dlx6, and most recently Hand2, each result in a small ventral jaw
  with dorsal jaw features. Mutations in zebrafish plcb3 lead to the same homeotic
  transformation. In this figure, cartoons of fish, mice, and humans indicate gene
  family members in this pathway that, when mutated, result in a homeotic transformation
  of the dorsal and ventral jaws (left: PLCB4 loss-of-function, right: GNAI3 gain-of-function).
  The arrow with a dashed line indicates hypothetical signaling between αq and PLCB4.
