caption: Scheme of PGF2α/FP pathway involved in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.
  Cardiac fibroblasts derived PGF2α induces cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and arrhythmia
  through FP receptor in adjacent cardiomyocytes (CMs); PGF2α stimulates renin release
  from juxtaglomerular granular cells (JGCs) by FP receptor in an autocrine fashion,
  and activate renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) to elevate blood pressure
  through enhancing salt/water reabsorption in kidney and constricting blood vessels
  directly via Angiotensin II (Ang II); PGF2α promotes resistance artery constriction
  through FP in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which eventually increases blood pressure
  and contributes to atherosclerosis; Activated RAAS also accelerates atherosclerosis.
  JGA, juxtaglomerular apparatus; AGT, angiotensinogen; ACE, angiotensin-converting
  enzyme; ALD, aldosterone.
