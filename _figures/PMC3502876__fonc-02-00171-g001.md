caption: Reactive oxygen species-mediated autophagy regulation. The ULK1/2–FIP200–mAtg13
  and Beclin1–Vps34–p150 protein complexes together with the two ubiquitin-like proteins
  Atg12 and LC3 (or Atg8) and their conjugating proteins, including Atg7 (E1-like
  enzyme), Atg10 (E2-like enzyme), and Atg3 (E2-like enzyme), are the primary regulators
  of autophagosome formation and, thus, autophagy induction. Atg4 cleaves Pro-LC3
  at its C-terminal-end, Atg7 and Atg3 add phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), and LC3-PE
  is then incorporated into the autophagosome membrane; Atg4 can also cleave LC3-PE
  to release free LC3 and negatively impact autophagy. The PI3K–Akt–mTORC1 pathway
  suppresses autophagy by inhibiting the ULK1/2–FIP200–mAtg13 complex. PI3K is activated
  in response to hormones and growth factors and suppresses TSC1/2 activity, thus
  resulting in Akt and mTORC1 activation; the phosphatase PTEN antagonizes PI3K, while
  the peroxiredoxins Prdx1 and 2 maintain PTEN function by preventing its oxidation.
  mTORC1 is also negatively regulated by HIF-1α via BNIP3 induction and by ATM via
  LKB1 and AMPK. The Beclin1–Vps34–p150 complex is positively regulated by Bif-1,
  UVRAG, AMBRA, and HMGB1, and negatively regulated by Bcl-2 and RUBICON. ROS stimulate
  autophagy by activating HIF-1α, AMPK, ATM, HMGB1, JNK1, ERK1/2 and inhibiting the
  PE-cleaving activity of Atg4, without affecting its ability to process the C-terminal
  end of LC3. ROS inhibit PTEN and are hypothesized to negatively affect TSC1/2 activity,
  potentially inhibiting autophagy. Upon its induction, autophagy results in ROS suppression.
