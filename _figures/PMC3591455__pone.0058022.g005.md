caption: It is the proposed mechanism of Zn-induced PTPase inhibition by ZIP9, which
  leads to the activation of B cell receptor signaling in DT40 cells. Intracellular
  zinc is incorporated into the Golgi by ZnT5/6/7. Zinc is released as induced by
  ZIP9 into the cytosol from the Golgi, which in turn inhibits PTPase activity and
  induces the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK probably indirectly by regulating upstream
  components of the signal transduction.
