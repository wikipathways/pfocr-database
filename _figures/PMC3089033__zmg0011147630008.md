caption: A diagram of the proposed cell survival signaling pathway in ER+ breast cancer
  cells with PI3KCA mutations and low phosphorylated Akt. SGK3 is induced by estrogen/ER
  through transcriptional mechanism and phosphorylated by PDK1 activated by PI3KCA
  mutations. SGK3 exerts cell survival signaling by up-regulating Bcl-xL expression,
  inhibiting the proapoptotic proteins [Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad) and Forkhead
  box O3 (FoxO3)] and phosphorylating Flightless I (FLII), thus enhancing nuclear
  receptor (NR)-mediated transcriptions.
