caption: VKORC1 reduces vitamin K epoxide, and is inhibited by warfarin. (A) VKORC1
  reduces vitamin K through an electron (e−) relay pathway. Redox protein generates
  thiols in VKORC1 located in the endoplasmic reticulum, which in turn generate membrane-embedded
  thiols that reduce vitamin K. (B) VKORC1 reduction of vitamin K epoxide (KO) to
  the vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) carboxylase cofactor occurs in two reactions that
  involve a vitamin K quinone (K) intermediate. VKORC1 exists as a dimer [], which
  can explain how VKORC1 performs both reactions. (C) Sequestration of the K intermediate
  may increase the efficiency of VKD protein carboxylation []. One monomer converts
  KO to the K intermediate, which is then repositioned for further reduction to KH2
  by the second monomer. Warfarin uncouples the two VKORC1 reactions [], which alters
  full reduction by inhibiting the K to KH2 reaction much more strongly that the KO
  to K reaction. Full reduction during warfarin therapy may therefore result from
  a second reductase cooperating with VKORC1 to generate the KH2 carboxylase cofactor.
