caption: Simplified overview of central pathways involved in proliferation and survival
  in CRC. EGFR is inhibited by gefitinib, but there is an interference with HGFR.
  While vemurafenib only blocks the left pathway in case of BRAF mutation, this interplay
  between the two pathways could be a reason for the low efficacy of vemurafenib in
  CRC even in case of an existing BRAF mutation.
