caption: In silico labeled JAK-STAT signaling pathway. STAT molecules S (blue) are
  phosphorylated by an active receptor-kinase complex (pR) and form dimers (pS-pS).
  These dimers enter the nucleus, dissociate, and are subsequently dephosphorylated.
  Finally, the single STAT molecules re-enter the cytoplasm, where they can again
  be phosphorylated and thus continue the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. The labeling
  approach is visualized by red spheres attached to the STAT molecules. At t = 0,
  all cytoplasmic STAT molecules are labeled. After the nuclear export, the label
  is removed from the molecule and enters the artificial pool of returned label. Consequently,
  an increasing fraction of cytoplasmic STAT molecules are not labeled which has to
  be considered in the calculation of fluxes for free and labeled entities. To determine
  the time-dependent label half-life and transit-time values, the labeling procedure
  is repeated for a series of time-points.
