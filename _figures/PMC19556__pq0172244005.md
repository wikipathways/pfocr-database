caption: Model for the role of Hrr25 and SBF (Swi4/Swi6) in the transcriptional response
  to DNA damage. The Hrr25 protein kinase is proposed to phosphorylate Swi6 in response
  to DNA damage. An Hrr25-independent pathway may also function through Swi4. These
  two pathways serve to activate SBF to promote the transcriptional induction of repair
  genes. See text for details.
