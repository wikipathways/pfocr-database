caption: General schematic diagram of molecular players involved in sex differentiation
  of gonochoristic teleost with genetic sex determination. Note that this represents
  a “typical” sex-differentiation pathway, while large-scale variations exist with
  respect to timing and sexual dimorphism of expression, as well as regulatory mechanisms.
  MPF, male producing/promoting factors, including androgens, estrogen receptor antagonists,
  aromatase inhibitors, male producing temperature, etc. FPF, female producing/promoting
  factors, including estrogens, androgen receptor antagonists, female producing temperature,
  etc. Upward/downward arrows indicate the expression of specific gene is upregulated/downregulated,
  respectively. Arrows pointing to specific gene indicate that the expression is upregulated.
  Inhibiting symbols pointing to specific gene indicate that the expression is downregulated.
