caption: Working model to explain the antidiabetic effect of ADV36. Overall, data
  from suggest that, in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver of mice, ADV36
  downregulates insulin signaling yet upregulates the Ras-PI3K pathway, which upregulates
  Glut1 and Glut4 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and downregulates Glut2 in
  liver. Furthermore, ADV36 increases adiponectin, which may activate AMPK. Collectively,
  this leads to greater glucose uptake by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and reduces
  hepatic glucose release, which may contribute to ADV36-induced improvement in systemic
  glycemic control[]. Modified from Krishnapuram et al[].
