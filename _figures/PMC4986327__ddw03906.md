caption: The germline Nf1 gene mutation independently determines astrocyte and microglia
  dysfunction relative to optic glioma formation and growth. Proposed model of the
  cell-autonomous (astrocytes) and non-cell-autonomous (microglia) effects of the
  germline Nf1 gene mutation on murine optic glioma growth. In microglia, the germline
  Nf1 gene mutation differentially impacts on JNK activation and Ccl5 expression,
  which results in varying levels of chemokine (Ccl5)-mediated AktThr308 activation
  in neoplastic astrocytes to increase optic glioma growth in vivo. Similarly, the
  germline Nf1 gene mutation differentially determines neurofibromin-regulated downstream
  signaling pathway activation and glial cell proliferation, leading to differing
  levels of cell-intrinsic astrocyte growth in the tumor.
