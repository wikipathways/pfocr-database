caption: '(A) Lack of carbohydrates can perturb the gut microbiota, shifting the composition
  to ‘beneficial’ bacteria. Through the gut-brain axis, a ketogenic diet (KD) improves
  neuronal function, including increasing GABA signaling, cerebral blood flow and
  clearance of amyloid-β. In the gut-liver axis, KD promotes PPARα activation of FGF21,
  where this hepatokine induces benefits to the liver, the kidney and adipose tissue.
  (B) One of the hepatic benefits is ketogenesis and the production of βOHB, which
  can inhibit NLRP3-mediated IL-1β secretion and reduce overall inflammation. However,
  a high salt diet can impede ketogenesis through the promotion of insulin-mediated
  ketone body clearance and mTOR activation, resulting in diminished βOHB and increased
  vascular damage, which can increase the overall risk for hypertension. In addition
  to this pathway, high salt intake can modulate the gut microbiota to promote Th17
  responses, which is also associated with increased hypertension risk. Key words:
  γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα),
  cAMP responsive element-binding protein 3-like 3 (CREB3L3), fibroblast growth factor
  21 (FGF21), angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), PPARγ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α),
  β-hydroxybutryate (βOHB), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), Nod-like receptor
  family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), interleukin-1β (IL-1β).'
