caption: Overview of Type I, Type II and Type III Signaling Pathways. Upon binding
  to their respective receptors, the JAK-STAT signaling pathways are activated that
  lead ultimately to induction and transcription of ISGs, resulting in the induction
  of antiviral responses. In humans, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 deficiency predispose to disease
  following LAV vaccine, but also to Herpes Simplex Encephalitis and severe COVID-19.
  AR STAT2 deficiency is characterized by a broader phenotype with susceptibility
  to LAV but also to various other viruses. AR complete STAT1 deficiency presents
  with the most severe phenotype, including life-threatening viral infections, but
  also life-threatening mycobacterial infections. TYK2 deficiency is similar but with
  a somewhat milder viral phenotype. No humans with complete JAK1 deficiency are described
  until now. In mice, there is broad viral susceptibility with STAT1−/− more severe
  than Ifnar1−/− and Ifnaar2−/− and STAT2−/− mice, and these more severe than Tyk2−/−
  and Irf9−/− at least for the viruses and the models tested. The width of the blue
  bar indicates the extent of viral susceptibility.
