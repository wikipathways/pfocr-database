caption: The influence of TP53 on FAM72 paralogs directly regulates the cell cycle
  in cancer. Upon a stressful DNA-damaging signal (e.g., gamma irradiation), TP53
  gets activated to mediate cell arrest in G0 to give the cell quiescence for cell
  repair or, if impossible, to induce the alternative pathway for apoptosis. TP53-mediated
  cell cycle arrest is conveyed by CDKN1A (p21) causing inhibition of the cell-cycle
  promoting the CDK4/6-E2Fx pathway; consequently, the G1/S phase genes remain blocked.
  The TP53-CDKN1A-CDK4/6 pathway also causes activation of DREAM, which in turn blocks
  FAM72 expression via the CHR element within the IGR of the |-SRGAP2–FAM72-| master
  gene.
