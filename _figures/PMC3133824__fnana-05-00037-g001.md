caption: Cytonuclear signaling pathways in MSNs. The indicated pathways have mostly
  been identified in D1R-expressing MSNs, although similar cascades exist in D2-expressing
  cells with some differences (Bertran-Gonzalez et al., ). The precise location of
  involved receptors (i.e., perikaryon vs dendrites and spines) is not indicated because
  it has not been determined experimentally in most cases. Activation of ERK by glutamate
  involves increases in cytosolic Ca2+ which stimulates Ras-GRF1 and possibly other
  guanine nucleotide exchange factors. A major source of Ca2+ is the activation of
  NMDAR by glutamate. This effect is strongly potentiated by stimulation of D1R by
  dopamine through (i) a cAMP-independent pathway involving Src-family tyrosine kinases
  (SFK); (ii) an amplification loop with inhibition of PP1 by phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32.
  PP1 acts both upstream of ERK (e.g., by dephosphorylating NR1 subunits of NMDAR)
  and by activating the tyrosine phosphatase STEP which dephosphorylates the regulatory
  tyrosine of ERK (not shown). In striatal neurons in culture, active ERK associates
  with endocytosed AMPA-R through adaptor protein 2 (AP2) together with the transcription
  factor Elk1 and this complex appears to be important for nuclear import of activated
  ERK and Elk1. D1R activates adenylyl cyclase (mostly AC5 isoform) through the stimulatory
  heterotrimeric Golf protein containing the αolf and γ7 subunits. The inactive PKA
  heterotetramer is usually anchored through AKAPs, yet to be characterized in MSNs.
  cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits (R) and releases the catalytic subunits (C).
  C subunits phosphorylate numerous substrates in the cytoplasm and diffuse to the
  nucleus where they can phosphorylate proteins such as CREB or histone H3. In MSNs
  however, a nuclear resident protein kinase, ERK-activated MSK1, plays a major role
  in CREB and H3 phosphorylation. CREB recruits CBP which has histone acetyltransferase
  activity. PKA phosphorylates DARPP-32 on Thr-34, turning it into a potent inhibitor
  of PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c). DARPP-32 continuously cycles between the cytoplasm
  and the nucleus and its nuclear export is facilitated by phosphorylation of Ser-97
  by CK2, which is present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of MSNs. PKA increases nuclear
  DARPP-32 by inducing the dephosphorylation of Ser-97 by PP2A. Dotted arrows indicate
  influences or catalysis, solid arrows displacement. Red arrows with a round end
  indicate inhibition. NPC, nuclear pore complex. See text for references.
