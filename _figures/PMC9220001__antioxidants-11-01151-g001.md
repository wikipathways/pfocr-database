caption: Theoretical model for the multidirectional interplays between mitochondrial
  oxidative stress, metabolic status, inflammation and cell death in RA. Mitochondria
  play essential roles at the crossroads of metabolism and innate immunity []. Thus,
  mitochondrial dysfunction derived from several danger signals could activate TCA
  disruption and thereby favoring a vicious cycle of oxidative/mitochondrial stress.
  In fact, oxidative damage in synovial tissue is associated with in vivo hypoxic
  status, high lactate and low glucose levels []. Mitochondrial dysfunction can act
  through modulating innate immunity via redox-sensitive inflammatory pathways (i.e.,
  NF-κB) or direct activation of the inflammasome. Inflammasome activation and NF-κB
  pathway could work together to activate inflammatory cytokines, thereby leading
  to overstimulation of the inflammatory response. On the other hand, mitochondria
  also have a central position in regulating cell death. In this sense, the two main
  regulated cell death pathways, apoptosis and autophagy, cooperate in a balanced
  interaction that promotes cell survival or cell death. Additionally, NF-κB could
  restrict inflammasome activation via elimination of damaged mitochondria through
  p-62-dependent clearance of damaged mitochondria as well as autophagy modulate NF-κB
  activation []. Additionally, multiple evidence suggests that pathological processes
  in RA can be shaped by epigenetic mechanisms and that mitochondria are involved
  in epigenetic regulation []. Natural bioactive agents of a healthy diet could protect
  mitochondria and inhibit the overactivation of mitochondrial oxidative stress and
  the associated inflammatory response that define RA.
