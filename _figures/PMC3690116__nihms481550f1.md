caption: 'Schematic model of FGF-2 and FGF-18 signaling pathways in articular cartilage
  and IVD. A: FGF-2 binds to both FGFR1 and FGFR3 with high affinity. The phosphorylation
  of FGFR1 triggers Ras and PKCδ activation, which converge on the Raf-MEK1/2–ERK1/2
  axis. Active ERK1/2 utilizes at least two critical transcription factors, Elk-1
  and RUNX2, to upregulate an array of genes including MMP-13, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5,
  COL10A1, and VEGF. In parallel, PKCδ also activates p38 and JNK, which act in concert
  with ERK1/2 to promote ECM degeneration and inhibition of anabolic activities. The
  binding of FGF-2 to FGFR3 may counteract the FGF-2-induced catabolic pathway, similar
  to that utilized by FGF-18. Therefore, the ratio of FGFR3/FGFR1 is a key to the
  biological outcome of FGF-2. B: FGF-18 specifically binds to FGFR3, which in turn
  activates MAPK and Akt pathways. The MAPK pathway differs from those in FGF-2 signaling,
  because neither Elk-1 nor RUNX2 is activated as a result. The Akt pathway may enhance
  PG deposition and account for the anabolic activity of FGF-18.'
