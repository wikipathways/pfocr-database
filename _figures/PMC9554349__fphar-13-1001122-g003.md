caption: Potential DDR1-mediated pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses in resident
  kidney cells. Upregulation of DDR1 in injured proximal tubule cells can contribute
  to inflammation by promoting MCP-1 production via a BCR/β-catenin pathway. It addition,
  it can contribute to fibrosis by translocating to the nucleus and promoting collagen
  transcription (non canonical signaling) or TGF-β secretion via STAT3 activation.
  In injured podocytes, DDR1 can interact with CD36 thus leading to free fatty acid
  (FFA) uptake, cell damage and in turn fibrosis. See text for details.
