caption: Functional interaction sub-network constructed by using module 2 genes. Gene
  products involved in the Aurora B signaling pathway have been encapsulated in the
  light brown shaded area, while gene products involved as components of the kinetochore
  in mitosis in the light grey shaded area. Edges between genes indicate functional
  interactions (FIs). FIs extracted from pathways are shown as solid lines (for example,
  AURKB→NCAPD2), while predicted ones are shown as dashed lines (for example, AURKB---ANKZF1).
  Extracted FIs involved in activation, expression regulation, or catalysis are labeled
  with arrows. Seven genes highlighted in yellow form a smaller network module that
  is also significantly related to breast cancer patient survival across five patient
  data sets.
