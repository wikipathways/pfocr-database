caption: Model of antidromic and downstream activation in STN-DBS.Stimulation effects
  in the antidromic direction take place upon stimulation of axons of the hyperdirect
  pathway. These stimulation effects may cause a suppression of band power in frontal
  cortical brain regions, as well as a lowering of functional connectivity between
  the frontal cortex and the STN (in blue; see also (; ; )). At the same time, stimulation
  effects can propagate in the downstream direction and thereby mainly affect the
  cortico-striato-thalamic loop. Downstream stimulation effects may lead to an increase
  in cortical functional connectivity via disinhibition of the thalamus (in red; (;
  )).Gpi, internal globus pallidus; SNr, substantia nigra pars reticulate; STN, subthalamic
  nucleus; DBS, deep brain stimulation. (For interpretation of the references to color
