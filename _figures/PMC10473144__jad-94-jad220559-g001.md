caption: Adult neurogenesis in physiological state and mechanisms of cell cycle reentry
  of post-mitotic neurons in AD. This fig depicts the flowchart describing neurogenic
  process and the cell cycle reentry of post-mitotic neurons in association with Wnt
  signaling in healthy and AD conditions. In the normal brain, expression of CDK4
  maintains the post-mitotic neurons at the G0 cell cycle phase whereas in the pathogenic
  process of AD the elevated expression of cyclin D, Cyclin B, and PCNA and downregulation
  of CDK4 results in the cell cycle reentry of post-mitotic neurons resulting in reactive
  neuroblastosis through the activation of Wnt signaling. Further, the activation
  of p53 in neurons can lead to apoptosis accounting for neurodegeneration in AD.
