caption: 'LPS proinflammatory signaling pathway. LPS binds to host cell surface receptors,
  and TLR4 is activated and triggers two signaling cascades: The first signaling cascade
  involving the TIRAP and MyD88 adaptor proteins is induced in the plasma membrane,
  while the second signaling cascade involving the adaptor proteins TRAM and TRIF
  begins in the early endocytosis after eyhndocytosis. The transcription and expression
  of inflammatory cytokine genes are activated through many signal transduction pathways
  such as NF-κB and AP-1, and inflammatory response is induced to initiate the pathogenic
  process of bacterial infection. See the text for details. LPS, Lipopolysaccharide;
