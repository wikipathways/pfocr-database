caption: 'A hypothetical yeast enzymatic pathway regulated by a hypothetical signaling
  pathway. (A) Enzymatic pathway alone (see text for context). A, B, and C are small
  molecules. Heavy arrows represent enzymatic reactions, and light arrows represent
  expression of the genes that encode the corresponding enzymes in the pathway. This
  pathway is controlled by the presence or absence of sucralose. (B) The same enzymatic
  pathway (lower line), intersecting with a signaling pathway (blue line) that is
  controlled by the presence or absence of neotame. In the signaling pathway, R, S,
  and T are proteins with the functions shown, encoded by Genes 3, 4, and 5 respectively.
  Light arrows indicate gene expression, but here, heavy arrows represent regulatory
  interactions: pointed arrows indicate activation, and the blunt arrow indicates
  inhibition. For example, in the presence of both sucralose and neotame, if the receptor
  R is activated by neotame binding, it activates the protein S. If S is active, it
  inactivates the transcription factor T, which is otherwise active and is required
  to activate transcription of Gene 2.'
