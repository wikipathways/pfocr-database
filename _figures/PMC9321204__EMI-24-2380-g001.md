caption: 'The GBT demethylation pathway and associated metabolic pathways. Shaded
  squares represent the MID, which is the proportion of a given metabolite that was
  in the isotopologue shown, where red atoms in molecular structures indicate 13C
  or 15N derived from GBT. For each molecule, the top row represents the northern
  experiment and the bottom row represents the southern experiment, with the initial
  in situ conditions as the first square and the final timepoint as the last square.
  Molecules in grey were not detected in our data but we infer their presence based
  on the downstream metabolites. Dashed arrows are known metabolic pathways that we
  did not see evidence for in our isotope‐enriched metabolomics data. The listed amino
  acids are those which increased in their relative isotopologue abundance in the
  THAAs in the southern experiment. DMSP, β‐alanine betaine and trigonelline are compounds
  that are methylated through SAM‐dependent methyltransferases and had significant
  increases in their 13C isotopologues. The pie charts show the proportion of organisms
  transcribing the genes associated with the demethylation pathway in this region
  in spring 2016: GBT to dimethylglycine (betaine‐homocysteine methyl‐transferase,
  bhmt, or glycine betaine oxidase, gbcAB), dimethylglycine to sarcosine (dimethylglycine
  dehydrogenase, dmgdh, or dimethylglycine oxidase, dmg), sarcosine to glycine (sarcosine
  dehydrogenase, sardh, monomeric sarcosine oxidase, msox, or tetrameric sarcosine
  oxidase, soxBDAG with soxA and soxB homologues displayed here). Pie charts show
  an average across the five stations in the NPTZ, with the exception of gbcA which
  was only detected at three stations. ‘Other alphaproteobacteria’ includes non‐Roseobacter
  Rhodobacterales, Rhizobiales and Sphingomonadales.'
