caption: Common alterations in fluorosis‐proliferation and differentiation. The role
  of fluoride in cell proliferation and differentiation is the focus of research into
  the pathogenesis of skeletal fluorosis. The BMP/Smad and Wnt signalling pathways
  play important roles in the viability and differentiation of osteoblasts. TGFβ receptor
  1‐smad3 signalling participates in the mechanism of biphasic modulation of osteoclast
  mode, regulated by fluoride. In addition, the FGF signalling pathway, which activates
  Akt and Erk1/2pathways, is responsible for the balance between cell proliferation
  and differentiation
