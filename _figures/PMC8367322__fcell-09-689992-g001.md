caption: A schematic diagram of the oncogenic role of lncRNA BANCR in regulating Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer and retinoblastoma. Accumulating research
  has figured out that lncRNA BANCR could play a crucial role in triggering the activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin cascade in several tumor cells through sponging various miRNAs.
  As an illustration, this lncRNA could elevate pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis through
  up-regulating expression levels of β-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclinD1 by miR-195-5p/Wnt/β-catenin
  axis in target cells (). In addition, overexpression of lncRNA BANCR through regulating
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway could promote cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and
  migration in retinoblastoma. In fact, this lncRNA via sponging miR-204-3p could
  have an effective part in enhancing the expression levels of Wnt4, β-catenin, and
  TCF4 in tumor cells (). Green arrows indicate the up-regulation of target genes
  modulated via lncRNA BANCR and red arrows depict inhibition of miRNAs regulated
  by this lncRNA.
