caption: Illustrates coronavirus infectivity with the target receptor of interaction
  and other host receptors involved in viral entry and infection. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
  bind to ACE2, it would lead to Ang II's overaccumulation that causes pathophysiological
  effects in the host cell subsequently to the human system. After binding to the
  receptor, with the help of host cellular enzymes, the virus would internalize through
  the endosomal pathway and release the viral RNA that would bind to the host cell
  genome. This would lead to transcription and translation of viral proteins assembled
  in the endoplasmic-reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC) and released as
  small viral particles through exocytosis. Other prominent receptors involved for
  coronavirus infection are CD147 and CD209L for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, while
  DPP4 is the receptor involved for MERS-CoV infection. Various therapies have been
  proposed to use RAS inhibitors like ACEi/ARB, recombinant RBD, ACE2-MSC, and cyclodextrin-soluble
  ACE2 to prevent and reduce the viral load and infection. Along with these possible
  therapies like the use of enzyme inhibitors, mutated target receptors, non-ACE2
  expressing immune cells, and the use of proteins like ENACα as a vaccine candidate
  that mimics the S1/S2 subunit
