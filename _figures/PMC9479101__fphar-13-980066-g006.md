caption: Effect of quercetin, morin and steppogenin treatment in mediating ageing
  intervention in the model yeast S. cerevisiae is proposed. Possible cross-talks
  between different cellular pathways during the acetic acid stress response under
  the control of key transcription factors and modulatory signaling kinase of Tor1-dependent
  pathway are shown.
