caption: Core pyrethrin biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme(s) for jasmone and cinerolone
  biosynthesis are unknown, as indicted with question marks. TcJMH is the T. cinerariifolium
  jasmolone hydroxylase and TcGLIP is the GDSL lipase-like protein that links one
  of the irregular monoterpene parts of the molecule to cinerolone, jasmolone, or
  pyrethrolone. TcPYS is the pyrethrolone synthase investigated by , which, unusually
  for a CYP, catalyzes a desaturation reaction. (Adapted from .)
