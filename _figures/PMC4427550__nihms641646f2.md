caption: Schematic drawing to illustrate the neurochemistry and molecular mechanisms
  of c-fos and Fos expression in strongly activated neurons in prefrontal cortex and
  nucleus accumbens of awake behaving animals. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter
  that increases neural activity. Dopamine enhances (red arrow and + sign) glutamate-mediated
  neural activation of the small proportion of neurons that have the highest levels
  of neural activity while inhibiting neural activation of the majority of neurons
  that have lower levels of neural activity. The detailed electrophysiological mechanisms
  underlying this glutamate-dopamine interaction are described in (). Strong persistent
  neural activity induces calcium (Ca2+) influx through NMDA-type glutamate receptors
  and voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs) to levels that are sufficient for
  phosphorylating and activating ERK/MAPK via the Ras-Raf-MEKK pathway. ERK/MAPK activation
  leads to phosphorylation of Elk-1 that is associated with serum response factor
  (SRF) as well as phosphorylation of CREB via ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). Elk-1/SRF
  and CREB are transcription factors that, when phosphorylated, can induce transcription
  of the coding sequence for c-fos. Transcribed c-fos mRNA and the translated protein
  product Fos can be used as markers of strongly activated neurons.
