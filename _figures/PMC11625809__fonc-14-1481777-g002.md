caption: 'LncRNAs are involved in the neuroendocrine secretion of prostate cancer.
  AR pathway: lncRNA H19 activates AR signaling by binding to the PRC2 complex and
  regulating H3K27me3 and H3K4me3; lncRNA-p21 binds to EZH2 while inhibiting the binding
  of EZH2 to HOTAIR, interfering with PRC2 formation, and enhances methylation of
  STAT3; LINC00844: promotes NDRG1 expression and inhibits AR expression. Non-AR pathway:
  LINC00689 promotes CTNNB1 expression and activates the Wnt signaling pathway; LINC00261
  acts as a miR-8485 molecular sponge and enhances CBX2 activity. AR, androgen receptor;
  PRC2, polycomb repressive complex 2; H3K27me3, Trimethylation modification of lysine
  at position 27 of histone H3; H3K4me3, The fourth lysine of histone H3 undergoes
  trimethylation catalyzed by methyltransferase (HMT); EZH2, enhancer of zeste homolog
  2; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3; NDRG1, N-myc
  downstream regulatory gene 1; CTNNB1, Catenin Beta 1 is a Protein Coding gene; CBX2,
