caption: Potential mechanisms of several lncRNAs in CC. Some lncRNAs play significant
  roles in CC progression by sponging miRNAs and interacting with other proteins,
  altering the cell cycle. (a) HOTAIR could act as a sponge for miR-143-3p, promoting
  BCL-2 expression. Also, HOTAIR exerts its tumor-promoting effect by sponging miR-17-5p
  and may indirectly modulate MAPK1 expression by binding to miR-23b. (b) H19 interacts
  with miRNAs of the let-7 family regulating diverse cellular processes. (c) MALAT1
  may regulate cell proliferation through the P16INK4A/CDKs/RB pathway. (d) Cervical
  Carcinoma High-Expressed 1 (CCHE1) enhancing the expression of PCNA, CCHE1 also
  participates in the ERK/MAPK pathway. (e) ANRIL inhibition guides the inactivation
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway. (f) Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) functions as a tumor-suppressor
  via regulating miR-21-5p. (g) Bladder cancer-associated transcript 1 (BLACAT1) binds
  to PRC2 and promotes proliferation, migration and invasion by modulating Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway. (h) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) can play the role of an oncogene
  activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. (i) SPRY4-Intronic transcript or Sprouty4-Intronic
  transcript 1 (SPRY4-IT1) could bind to miR-101-3p to regulate the expression of
  the target gene ZEB1. (j) GAS5 expression is decreased in CC, leading to dysregulation
  of miR-196a and miR-205, which function as oncogenic miRNAs by targeting FOXO1 and
  PTEN, respectively. (k) DLX6 antisense RNA 1 (DLX6-AS1) may promote cell proliferation
  by sponging miR‑199a. (l) HOXD-AS1 upregulates ZEB1 through binding to miR-130a-3p.
  (m) CRNDE acts as an oncogene in CC through sponging miR-183. (n) PVT1 acts as a
  sponge for miR-424, miR-195 and miR-200b. Overall, the figure shows some summarized
  molecular mechanisms by which the lncRNAs promote cell growth, migration and proliferation
  and EMT in a CC cell. Information extended in the text.
