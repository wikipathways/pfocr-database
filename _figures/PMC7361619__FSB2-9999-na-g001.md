caption: Proposed mechanism of COVID‐19—associated dyslipidemia and impaired resolution
  of infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) binds
  to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via spike protein, which facilitates entry
  into the cell with subsequent damage by alveolar macrophages. Subsequently, tissue
  microenvironment releases pro‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL‐6, MCP1,
  and MIP) promoting attraction of macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells. This cell
  activation leads to uncontrolled inflammation and immune dysregulation with further
  accumulation of eicosanoids like PGE2, TXB2, LTB4, and LXA4. Persistent inflammation
  culminates in the modulation of HDL‐associated apolipoproteins, such as a decrease
  in apolipoprotein A‐I (ApoA‐I), ApoE, and an increase serum amyloid protein A, which
  adversely affects the anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory function
  of HDL. The imbalance in the antioxidant system also causes oxHDL modification via
  intracellular lectin‐like oxLDL (LOX‐1) receptor. The extracellular portion of LOX‐1,
  serum‐soluble form (sLOX‐1), additionally stimulate interaction between oxidized
  lipids, and circulating macrophages resulting in pro‐inflammatory cytokines release,
  such as IL‐6, IL‐10, and tumor necrosis factor‐alpha (TNF‐α). Impaired paraoxonase
  1 (PON1) enzyme function on HDL, and excessive inflammatory response leads to further
  lipid oxidation. Excessive development of oxLDL and oxHDL results in lipoprotein
  transport alteration and impairment of the reverse‐cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway
  (shown at left) characterized by insufficient ApoA‐I interaction with the adenosine
  triphosphate‐binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) on macrophages and decreased
  cholesterol esterification by lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). This
  culminates in decreased return of cholesteryl esters to the liver either directly
  after interaction with hepatic scavenger receptor‐B1 (SR‐B1) receptors or indirectly
  after transfer to LDL by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and uptake by
  hepatic LDL receptors (LDL‐R). Low levels of ApoE and ApoC‐III on HDL result in
  decreased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, which in turn leads to VLDL and TGs
  accumulation
