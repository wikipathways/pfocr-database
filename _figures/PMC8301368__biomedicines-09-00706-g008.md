caption: Functional consequences of PAF-AH silencing. By PLA2G7 silencing, PAF-mediated
  signaling dominated. Binding to its Gq-coupled receptor PTAFR, PAF activated phosphorylation
  cascades, which often lead to oncogenic transformation, tumor growth, angiogenesis,
  and metastasis [,,,]. Activation of Src/FAK and their downstream targets PI3K and
  MMP2/MMP9 resulted in cancer cell proliferation and cancer invasion, respectively
  []. Proliferation and anti-apoptosis are induced via FAK/STAT []. GSK-3β is inactivated
  by AKT, leading to enhanced migration by Rac-1 activation and Rho-A inactivation
  and active Wnt signaling by stabilizing β-catenin [].
