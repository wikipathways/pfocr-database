caption: ER stress and human diseases triggered by misfolded protein aggregates. Environmental
  conditions, such as genetic mutations, hypoxia, and oxidative stress, disrupt ER
  homeostasis, leading to protein misfolding and accumulation. This, in turn, induces
  ER stress and expedites the build-up of disease-associated protein aggregates. The
  activation of the UPR signaling pathway serves to alleviate ER stress. However,
  when sustained ER stress surpasses the adaptive response capacity to manage protein
  misfolding, it can culminate in cell death, inflammation, and the proliferation
  of cancer cells, consequently contributing to disease progression. (ER stress, endoplasmic
  reticulum stress; UPR, unfolded protein response; PERK, protein kinase R-like endoplasmic
  reticulum kinase; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; ATF6, activating transcription
  factor 6; Bip, immunoglobulin binding protein; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor
  2α.)
