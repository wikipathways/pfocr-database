caption: 'PD-L1 is a well-known immune suppressive factor in a variety of cancer types.
  Two possible mechanisms of PDL1 regulation in EBV positive NPC was proposed. The
  first one (innate immune resistance): constitutive oncogenic pathway activation
  mediated by LMP1 up-regulates PD-L1 expression, which is independent of inflammatory
  signals in the tumor microenvironment; and the second one (adaptive immune resistance):
  PD-L1 is induced in response to inflammatory signals, such as IFN-γ, which are produced
  during an active anti-viral and anti-tumor immune response.'
