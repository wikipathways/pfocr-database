caption: The IS-induced increase in the expression of IL-1β and IL-18 may be mediated
  through the NLRP3/caspase-1 signaling pathway, and the secreted IL-1β and IL-18
  may bind to their receptors, inducing cell apoptosis by activating the early apoptotic
  cascade. IS = Indoxyl sulfate; Iκbα = inhibitor of kappa B; NF-кB = Nuclear factor
  kappa B; NLRP3 = NLR pyrin domain-containing protein 3; ASC = Apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein; Casp1 = Caspase-1; IL-1β = Interleukin-1β; IL-18 = Interleukin-18.
