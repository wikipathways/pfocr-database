caption: Regulatory pathways of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is co-regulated by iron metabolism,
  lipid metabolism, and antioxidant systems. The inhibition of lipid peroxidation
  is mainly mediated by the SLC7A11-GSH-GPX4 pathway, FSP1-CoQ10-NAD (P)H pathway,
  GCH1-BH4-DHFR pathway and DHO-DHODH-OA pathway. Among them, the FSP1 pathway exists
  in the cytoplasm, the DHODH pathway exists in the mitochondria, and the GPX4 pathway
  plays a role in both. SLC7A11, Cystine/glutamate antiporter solute carrier family
  seven member 11; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase 4; GSH, glutathione; FSP1, ferroptosis
  suppressor protein 1; GGH1, GTP Cyclohydrolase 1; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin; DHFR,
  dihydrofolate reductase; DHO, dehydrogenation of dihydroorotate; DHODH, Dihydroorotate
