caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the molecular events that take place in the
  bladder mucosa and detrusor, leading to the impairment of insulin-induced detrusor
  relaxation in metabolic syndrome (MS)-associated overactive bladder. High fructose
  diet induces hyperphosphorylation of IRS1 and IRS2, resulting in insulin resistance
  and the subsequent downregulation of the PI3K/Akt/eNOS signalling pathway and NO
  production in the mucosa. This is followed by the suppression of cGMP activity,
  and expression and level of PDE5 in the detrusor, leading to impairment of insulin-induced
  detrusor relaxation. Tadalafil treatment may ameliorate the MS-associated bladder
  overactivity through restoring insulin-activated detrusor relaxation via molecular
  repertories that are associated with increased eNOS phosphorylation in the bladder
  mucosa, restoration of urinary NO availability and detrusor cGMP level.

    relaxation via molecular repertories that are associated with increased eNOS phosphorylation
    in the bladder mucosa, restoration of urinary NO availability and detrusor cGMP
