caption: 'Schematic representation of the coagulation cascade and the fibrinolytic
  system. In the coagulation cascade, the extrinsic pathway starts with tissue factor
  (TF) and activated factor VII (FVIIa). Tissue factor in physiological conditions
  is not in contact with the blood; however, damage of blood vessel structure can
  expose this membrane-associated glycoprotein to the blood, thus activating the extrinsic
  pathway of the coagulation cascade. TF can also be expressed by mononuclear cells
  or endothelial cells in response to inflammatory mediators. The TF/FVIIa complex
  promotes the activation of factor X (FXa). In the intrinsic pathway, negatively
  charged surfaces (such as phospholipids and polyphosphates from activated platelets)
  activate FXII, initiating a cascade leading to FXa. The common pathway FXa, along
  with the cofactor FVa, converts prothrombin (FII) to thrombin (FIIa). Finally, thrombin
  activates fibrinogen into fibrin and FXIIIa acts on fibrin strands to form a fibrin
  mesh. Regulation of coagulation activation occurs by three distinct natural anticoagulant
  pathways: AT (which blocks FXa and thrombin), TFPI (which inhibits the tissue factor–factor
  VIIa complex), and aPC (which proteolytically degrades factor Va and factor VIIIa).
  Natural regulators of the coagulation cascade are indicated in green: TFPI, AT,
  and aPC. Once the first thrombin is produced, it induces the propagation of the
  coagulation cascade (red arrows) but also a feedback regulation through aPC. In
  the fibrinolytic system, uPA and tPA catalyze the proteolysis of plasminogen into
  plasmin, which, in turn, degrades fibrin. Inhibition of the plasminogen system occurs
  by specific PAIs and by α2-AP at the level of plasmin.'
