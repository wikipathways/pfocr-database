caption: 'Illustration of the analyzed Wnt signaling genes in MG-63s on micro-pillars
  P5 compared with unstructured Ref. Note in particular the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway: P5 up-regulated genes (red-backed)—sclerostin (SOST), inhibitor of β-catenin
  and TCF-4 (ICAT), SRY-box transcription factor 17 (SOX17); P5 down-regulated genes
  (green-backed)—secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4). In contrast, the non-canonical
  Wnt signaling pathways (Wnt/calcium and Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP)) showed no
  difference in mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) expression (filtered out). Illustration
  of the Wnt-WikiPathways. (TAC 4.0.2.1.5. software (Transcriptome Analysis Console)).'
