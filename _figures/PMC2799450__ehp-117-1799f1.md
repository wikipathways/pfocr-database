caption: A hypothetical unifying mechanism linking DNA hypomethylation due to chemicals
  and nutrient deficiency or imbalance. Vit, vitamin. DNA methylation pattern can
  be disturbed because of depletion of GSH when it is chronically consumed for conjugation
  of chemicals and their metabolites. Under usual circumstances, metabolism of homocysteine
  contributes to both the methionine and GSH synthesis pathways. In the presence of
  chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants that deplete GSH, contribution to
  the methionine pathway may be diminished because of greater need to synthesize GSH
  (numbered boxes on the right).
