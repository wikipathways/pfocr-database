caption: '(a). Coronavirus structure. The coronavirus structure includes the (+) ssRNA
  genome contained within the nucleocapsid surrounded by an envelope. The envelope
  contains envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and spike (S) protein that
  has two subunits, S1 and S2 (Li, 2016). The envelope protein (E), the third of four
  structural proteins, plays a role in the assembly and release of the virus. The
  membrane protein (M) promotes membrane curvature and viral assembly. S1 contains
  the RBD and is responsible for binding to the host’s cellular receptor, while S2
  aids in the fusion and entrance process of the virus into the cell. The nucleocapsid
  protein (N) is contained within the envelope, and it supports viral replication
  by packaging the genome into the virion particle and antagonizing IFN-mediated host
  immunity. (b). General life cycle of a coronavirus. (1) the virus binds via the
  S1 subunit receptor-binding domain to the appropriate receptor (shown in (c) for
  each respective coronavirus) and enters the cell either through direct fusion with
  the cell membrane or through the endocytosis/endosomal pathway, as shown in the
  figure. Note that the figure depicts the alveolar membrane, as coronavirus receptors
  are predominantly found on the alveolar membrane in the lower respiratory tract.
  The end result of receptor binding and entry is release of the +ssRNA viral genome
  in the host cell cytoplasm. (2) The +ssRNA can be directly translated by host cell
  ribosomes. Translation of early proteins occurs first, producing a polypeptide chain
  that needs to be cleaved to be activated. (3) The polypeptide chains produced in
  translation are cleaved and activated in a step called proteolysis. One of the activated
  proteins produced includes replicase. (4) An RNA replicase-transcriptase complex
  forms to create -ssRNA strands from the +ssRNA. The -ssRNA strands are used as templates
  to create more genomic +ssRNA, which can be packaged into virions and also (5) translated
  to produce late viral proteins. The late viral proteins include structural proteins
  S, M, and E, which are incorporated into the virion in virion assembly (6). (7)
  The virions then exit the host cell through budding. (c). Coronavirus receptor binding
  and entry: SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2
  differ in receptor type, receptor-ligand affinity, and downstream effects. This
  figure depicts the alveolar epithelial membrane. Both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 bind to
  ACE-2 receptor in the alveolar epithelial membrane. The RBD residues in the S glycoprotein
  of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor with 10 to 20 times higher affinity when
  compared to that of SARS-CoV-1. The difference in RBD affinity for the ACE2 receptor
  is demonstrated in the figure with a bigger arrow showing SARS-CoV-2 binding to
  the ACE2 receptor versus SARS-CoV-1 binding the ACE2 receptor. MERS-CoV binds to
  the DPP4 receptor. DPP4 receptors show a preferential spatial location in Alveolar
  epithelial cells (depicted in the figure above), vascular endothelium (lymphatics),
  and pleural mesothelia; thus, MERS is characterized as a lower respiratory tract
  disease. All three of the depicted coronaviruses can release the RNA viral genome
  into the cell via (a) membrane fusion mediated by protein TMPRSS2 or (b) endocytosis
  and the endosomal pathway mediated by CAT B/L. Downstream effects of SARS-CoV-1
  and -2 are similar, including increased activation of the NF-κB pathway, increased
  cytokines including IL-6 promoting inflammation, and accumulation of angiotensin
  II due to reduced ACE2 receptor availability []. The downstream cellular effects
  of MERS-CoV are not well characterized.'
