caption: 'DNA damage agents and cellular repair pathways. DNA damage repair (DDR)
  pathways are activated in response to endogenous stresses (e.g., base depurination,
  deamination and reactive by-products of cellular metabolism) or exogenous exposure
  to different types of radiation or genotoxic agents. DDR comprises a network of
  proteins that are either DNA damage sensors, signalling mediators or effector proteins
  that execute DNA repair. The base excision repair (BER) pathway for single-strand
  breaks (SSBs), repairs minor DNA changes originated from oxidized or alkylated bases
  and small base adducts, with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) being the major
  player. The nucleotide base excision repair (NER) pathway deals with modified nucleotides
  that change the double helix structure, such as those induced by ultraviolet (UV)
  light. The mismatch repair (MMR) pathway deals with DNA damage that disturb the
  DNA helical structure and replication errors as substitution, insertions and deletions.
  Four different DDR mechanisms are described for double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair:
  homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), alternative NHEJ
  and single-strand annealing (SSA) pathways. Loss or aberrations in DDR proteins
  allows cell cycle proliferation and evasion of apoptotic events, resulting in increased
  genomic instability and cancer development. Radiotherapy (Rtx); Apurinic/apyrimidinic
  endonuclease 1 (APE1); MRE11/RAD50/NSB1 (MRN); Xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation
