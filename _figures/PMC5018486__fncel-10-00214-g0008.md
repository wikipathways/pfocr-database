caption: 'Schematic illustration of GLP-1R signaling in GnRH neurons and its proposed
  action on presynaptic GABA release. Effect of the GLP-1R agonist (Exendin-4) or
  antagonist (Exendin-3) is mediated by G-protein complex, which may activate two
  retrograde signaling cascades. The first pathway involves activation of the intracellular
  TRPV1 which decreases postsynaptic production and release of 2-AG resulting in the
  suppression of inhibition of the presynaptic GABA release. The second one involves
  the release of NO produced by nNOS which increases the release probability and vesicular
  reuptake of GABA at the presynaptic terminal. Abbreviations: GLP-1R, glucagon-like
  peptide 1 receptor; AC, adenylate cyclase; Gα, Gβ, Gγ, G-protein subunits; DAG,
  diacylglycerol; DGL, DAG-lipase; CB1, cannabinoid receptor type-1; AM251, CB1 antagonist;
  2-AG, 2-arachidonoylglycerol; GABAA-R, GABAA receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; nNOS,
  neuronal nitric oxide synthase; L-NAME, Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride,
  a NOS inhibitor; NPLA, N5-[Imino(propylamino)methyl]-L-ornithine hydrochloride,
  a nNOS inhibitor; GDP-β-S, GDP-Beta-S trilithium salt, a G-protein inhibitor; CPTIO,
  Carboxy-PTIO potassium salt, a NO scavenger; TRPV1, transient receptor potential
  vanilloid 1; AEA, anandamide; AMG9810, TRPV1 antagonist; FAAH, fatty acid amide
  hydrolase; PF3845, FAAH-inhibitor. Red lines depict inhibitory actions, blue line
  refers to excitatory action, and dotted lines represent hypothetical relations.'
