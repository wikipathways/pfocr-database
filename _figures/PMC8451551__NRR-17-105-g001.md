caption: 'Schematic graph depicting the HIFα signaling pathway and its regulations
  at the different levels.The transcription factor family HIFα is a heterodimer consisting
  of an oxygen-sensitive HIF1α (or HIF2α) and a constitutively expressed HIF1β. Under
  normoxia, HIFα (HIF1α or HIF2α) is subjected to rapid proteasome-mediated degradation
  which requires the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins and the protein von
  Hippel-Lindau (VHL). Under hypoxia, PHD activity is inhibited, leading to HIF1/2α
  stabilization and subsequent accumulation in the nucleus where they dimerize with
  HIF1β at the hypoxia responsive elements (HRE) and recruit the co-activator p300/CBP
  to activate its target gene expression. Hydroxylation of the asparagine residue
  in the C-terminal activation domain of HIFα by the factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) prevents
  the recruitment of p300/CBP to HIFα at the HRE, thus negatively regulating HIFα-mediated
  transcriptional activity. DMOG, an inhibitor for PHD activity; chetomin, a compound
  blocking p300/CBP recruitment and subsequent signaling activation. Genetic or pharmacological
  manipulations of PHD, VHL, or FIH provides powerful avenues in activating or suppressing
  HIFα-mediated signaling pathway. The canonical HIFα target genes include those involved
  in angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, and glycolysis where the identities of the
  non-canonical HIFα target genes are cell type- and context-dependent, for example
  Ascl2, Dlx3, Wnt7a/b, and Sox9 (see the text for discussion). Ascl2: Achaete-scute
  like 2; CBP: CREB-binding protein; Dlx3: distal-less homeobox 3; DMOG: dimethyloxallyl
  glycine.'
