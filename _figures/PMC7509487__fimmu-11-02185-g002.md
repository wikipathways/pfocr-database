caption: '(A) How a miRNA affects cellular function: Left, repression of one critical
  mRNA by an individual miRNA determines cell function. Deletion of specific miRNA
  recognition elements (MREs) through genetic engineering constitutes the gold-standard
  to identify “master” targets. The miR-155/SOCS1 axis represents such an example
  in Treg-cell biology. Right: co-targeting networks. A single miRNA might target
  multiple mRNAs within the same pathway, generating functional outputs despite minor
  regulatory effects at the level of individual targets. Repression of multiple tyrosine
  and dual-specificity phosphatases within the TCR signaling pathway by miR-181 may
  represent such a scenario. Note, that in both cases multiple alternative targets
  of miR-155 and miR-181 have been identified, which are likely to contribute to cellular
  function. (B) Context-dependent miRNA function. The function of a miRNA most likely
  depends on the balance between its effective concentration and the concentration
  of accessible MREs. This balance is determined by miRNA and mRNA transcription,
  possible competition of access to MREs, selective recruitment to functional RISC
  complexes (high molecular weight, HMW, vs. low molecular weight, LMW), post-transcriptional
  regulation of miRNA, as well as alternative polyadenylation and splicing of mRNA.'
