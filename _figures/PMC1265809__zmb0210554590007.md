caption: Hypothetical model for implication of caspase-2 in lipid biosynthesis pathway.
  Under depletion of lipids, the nuclear active form of SREBP-2 (nSREBP-2) is released
  to activate target genes involved in cholesterol and/or triacylglycerol synthesis
  pathways in order to restore lipid contents in cells. CASP-2 is also induced by
  nSREBP-2. Since Casp-2 siRNA reduces lipidogenic gene expression induced by nSREBP-2
  as well as lipid synthesis, we propose that caspase-2 is required, although not
  sufficient by itself, to account for roughly 50% of the SREBP-mediated effects on
  cellular lipid anabolism.
