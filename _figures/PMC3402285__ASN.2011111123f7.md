caption: Schematic illustration of the signaling transduction pathway in tPA-induced
  NF-κB activation. tPA promotes the interaction and aggregation of annexin A2 and
  CD11b, inducing the clustering and outside-in signaling of CD11b integrin, which
  leads to the activation of the downstream ILK, phosphorylation of IκB, and subsequent
  activation of NF-κB pathway. (A–C) Blockade of any step within this signaling cascade
  by various strategies eliminates tPA-induced NF-κB activation. (D) Ectopic expression
  of wild-type ILK mimics tPA effect.
