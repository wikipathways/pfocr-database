caption: Overview of the three adipogenic transdifferentiation pathways. The first
  strategy is to enforce or activate the canonical adipogenic pathway. The ultimate
  goal is to increase the expression level of adipogenic master genes Prdm16, Pparg
  as well as C/EBP. It could be directly manipulating these three genes or through
  indirect activation by chemical compounds (Thiazolidinediones or Bexarotene), molecules
  (EBF2, BMP2, or EHMT1), or microRNAs (miR-193b or miR-133). The second strategy
  is to suppress myogenic program in myoblasts. This strategy mostly focuses on the
  Pax7-MyoD/Myf5 cascade. It has been reported that MyoD acts through E2F4/p107/p130
  regulating axis which in turn upregulates PRDM16. The third strategy involves other
  signaling pathways including DN MKK3, Msx1, Shp2, MAPK, IGF-1, as well as Wnt signaling
  pathways
