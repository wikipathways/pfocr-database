caption: Trx1 has a conserved catalytic site (-Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-Lys) that undergoes
  reversible oxidation to the cysteine-disulfide (Trx-S2) form through the transfer
  of reducing equivalents to a disulfide substrate (X-S2). In health, the oxidized
  (1) Trx1 form (Trx-S2) is converted back to the cysteine-thiol reduced (2) form
  [Trx-(SH)2] by the NADPH-dependent flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), so
  maintaining balance between oxidized and reduced Trx1 forms, and catalytically interacts
  with CD30 cell membrane receptor (CD30R) on the immune cells (9). The consequent
  oxidized (3) and reduced (4) states of CD30R determine its respective ability (5)
  or inability (6) to engage its ligand CD30L. In this way, it is possible to transduce
  signals of M and DC intracellular pathways for Treg/Th1/Th17 cytokine production,
  leading to balance of Th differentiation into Treg/Th1/Th17 cells, for immune response
  homeostasis
