caption: The regulation of fatty acid metabolism in CSCs. Lipid metabolism plays an
  important role in regulating the stemness properties of CSCs. In the pathway of
  fatty acid metabolism, acyl-CoA synthetase very-long-chain 3 (ACSVL3/SLC27A3) promotes
  the conversion of fatty acyl adenylate to fatty acyl CoA, which subsequently leads
  to β-oxidation of fatty acids and confers the stemness properties to CSCs. The generation
  of fatty acyl carnitine is supported by carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B),
  which is upregulated by leptin-induced JAK/STAT3 signaling. JAK/STAT3 signaling
  can be repressed by AZD1480, a pan-JAK small molecule inhibitor, which may also
  affect the generation of CPT1B. Lipid desaturation has also been suggested to enhance
  CSCs maintenance, which is critically mediated by an increase of the stearoyl-CoA
  desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity. The enhanced expression of SCD1 leads to the transformation
  of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which subsequently
  promotes the activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). There is a feedforward loop
  that unsaturated fatty acids increase SCD1 via NFκB. The addition of curcumin blocks
  the expression of SCD1, which at last exerts the effect similar to CAY10566 and
  SC-26196 that influences the conversion of SFAs to MUFAs. Lipid metabolism enzymes
  such as arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) also support the maintenance of
  stemness of CSCs by increasing the generation of leukotrienes (LT) from arachidonic
  acid (AA). Anticancer therapies targeting fatty acid metabolism may inhibit enzymes
  to modulate the stemness property of CSCs. The abovementioned pathways including
  fatty acid synthesis can be inhibited by cerulenin, soraphen and by blocking PPARγ
  signaling with GW9662, respectively.
