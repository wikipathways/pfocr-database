caption: Schematic illustration showing the possible mechanism by which adrenomedullin
  promotes tissue repair and regeneration following the inflammatory response in EAU
  mice. In the EAU model, the AM-RAMP2 system is thought to exert anti-inflammatory
  effects and promote tissue repair by activating Tregs and M2 macrophages, thereby
  contributing to the improvement of disease pathology. Exogenous administration of
  AM reduced the expression of IFN-γ and IL-17, which are produced by Th1 and Th17
  cells, respectively. In contrast, the expression of IL-13, a cytokine derived from
  Th2 cells, and IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine derived from Tregs, was increased.
  Furthermore, M2 macrophages may promote tissue repair by activating the TGF-β–Smad3
  signaling pathway
