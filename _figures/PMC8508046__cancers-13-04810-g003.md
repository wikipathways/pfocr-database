caption: Analysis of PPI based on genes with recurrent mutation and associated genes.
  (A) Ocular sebaceous carcinoma (SeC-O). (B) Extraocular sebaceous carcinoma (SeC-EO).
  The TP3 pathway, SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) pathway, and MMR pathway
  were shared by both SeC-O and SeC-EO. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (PIK3CA) and Notch
  signaling pathway (NOTCH1) were unique to SeC-O and Sec-EO, respectively.
