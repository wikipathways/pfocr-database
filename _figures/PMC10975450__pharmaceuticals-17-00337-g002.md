caption: 'Signaling pathway molecular mechanisms: Several signaling pathways play
  a major role in tissue development and thus in PSC differentiation, specifically
  into cardiac tissue. The molecular mechanisms of these pathways are shown as the
  signal is transduced from outside of the cell, past the cell membrane, through the
  cytosol, past the nuclear membrane, and into the nucleus where transcription factors
  mediate changes in gene expression for the given pathway. Wnt signaling uses Wnt
  proteins as ligands to the Frizzled (Fz) and LRP5/6 co-receptor, where receptor
  activation recruits Disheveled to arrest the destruction complex, enabling β-catenin
  accumulation in the cytosol, which triggers its translocation to the nucleus, where
  mesodermal genes are activated. TGF-Β and BMP signaling occur through their respective
  receptors mediated by phosphorylated Smad proteins to promote cardiac and cardiac
  mesoderm genes. IGF signaling occurs when IGF-1/2 activates IGF1R, leading to cardiomyocyte
  growth through mTOR signaling and cardiomyocyte proliferation through MAPK-ERK signaling.
  Retinoic acid (RA) occurs when CRBP imports retinol into the cell which is converted
  to RA by enzymes RDH and RALDH. RA then initiates the translocation of RXR and RAR
  to the nucleus, which specifies the cardiomyocyte phenotype and the heart’s anterior–posterior
  axis. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling occurs when a Hh protein variant activates Smoothened
  (Smo) by inhibiting its inhibitor PTCH1/2. This allows Smo to activate Gli1/2/3,
  which are translocated to the nucleus to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation. Hippo
  and Yap/TAZ signaling is mediated by a variety of signals of tissue growth which,
  when sufficiently present, activate the MSTV1/2 to LATS1/2 cascade to inhibit the
  proliferative YAP/TAZ pathway and to induce arrest of cardiomyocyte proliferation.
