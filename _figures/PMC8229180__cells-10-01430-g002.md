caption: Age-related changes in p27Kip1 regulation and cellular function. In young
  cells, pro-survival and autophagy mechanisms are able to activate during cell stress
  and promote survival and proliferation. The balance between cell anabolism and catabolism
  is regulated, in part, by the AMPK/mTORC1 pathway. Under nutrient/energy stress,
  AMPK is phosphorylated, and activated from upstream signaling. This initiates a
  series of downstream signaling to ULK1 and p27Kip1 to promote autophagy and prevent
  apoptosis. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of ULK1 with start the first step of the
  autophagy pathway, which is phagosome formation. Phosphorylated p27Kip1 will inhibit
  the pro apoptotic protein, Bax while inducing autophagy through inhibition of mTORC1.
  This is achieved by inhibition of ragulator, a key protein involved in docking mTORC1
  regulatory proteins to the lysosome. In addition to the downstream effects, AMPK
  can directly inhibit mTORC1 by inhibition of mTOR kinase activity and through phosphorylation
  and inhibition of raptor protein. With proper AMPK activity, p27Kip1 will accumulate
  in the cytosol, stimulate autophagy and inhibit apoptosis. In addition, cytoplasmic
  p27Kip1 will recruit and import cyclin D/CDK4/6 into the nuclei so it can inhibit
  Rb and promote entry into the cell cycle. In aged cells, AMPK activation is suppressed
  during cellular stress. This results in hypophosphorylation of AMPK and loss of
  kinase activity. The inability to phosphorylate and stabilize cytosolic p27Kip1
  will promote its sequestering in the nuclei and/or degradation of cytoplasmic p27Kip1.
  In the nuclei, p27Kip1 will inhibit cyclin E/CDK2 and suppress gene expression of
  cell cycle proteins. Furthermore, the lack of phosphorylated ULK1 and p27Kip1 leads
  to a reduction in autophagy and susceptibility to apoptosis. The lack of mTORC1
  inhibition will further inhibit ULK1 and autophagy.
