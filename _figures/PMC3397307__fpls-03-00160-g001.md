caption: (A,B) Modulation of host defense-signaling networks by pathogen effectors.
  One example of effector mediated host defense modulation is the manipulation of
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation cascades. (A) Host defenses
  may be activated by the perception and binding of pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) with the aid of a
  co-receptor (CR). Successful PAMP perception triggers a MAPK phosphorylation cascade
  resulting in transcription factor (TF) activation, defense gene expression and PAMP-triggered
  immunity (PTI). However, pathogen effectors (E) can manipulate this signaling pathway
  at a number of key steps (B) resulting in effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS).
  For example, the MAPK cascade can be blocked either by the effector perturbing CR-PRR
  activities or by the effector modifying MAPKs directly. Alternatively, nuclear targeting
  effectors may block defense gene induction, ultimately leading to enhanced susceptibility
  and the onset of disease. (C) Two models for effector-triggered post-translational
  modifications. In Model 1 (direct effector-triggered modification – DETM) the effector
  (E) binds the host target protein (T) and directly catalyzes its post-translational
  modification (PTM). In Model 2 (indirect effector-triggered modification – IETM)
  the effector binds the target protein and recruits a host machinery (HM) which catalyzes
  target PTM. The modified host protein may then be subject to proteasome mediated
  degradation (1), altered structural confirmation and activity (2), or re-localization
  (3).
