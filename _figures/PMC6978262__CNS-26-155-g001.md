caption: 'The signaling transduction pathways of regulating autophagy. The autophagy
  can be regulated by two pathways: mTOR‐dependent pathway and mTOR‐independent pathway.
  The mTOR is the core molecule in regulating autophagy, and phosphorylation of mTOR
  can lead to the phosphorylation of P70S6K1 which is a subtrate protein of mTOR,
  thereby inhibiting autophagy. In a physiological situation, the autophagy can be
  activated by some factors such as chronic stress, starvation, and GCs via inhibiting
  the expression of mTOR. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR and TRPML1/PPARγ/AMPK/mTOR are negnative
  and positive pathways in regulating autophagy respectively, inhibition and activation
  of the two pathways can activate autophagy. Besides, the Dihydroceramide is a newly
  positive regulator of autophagy via mTOR. ROS induces autophagy through both mTOR‐dependent
  and independent pathways. The inflammatory activation of microglia also plays a
  role in activating autophagy. Others, the TyrRS/PARP1/SIRT1 and TRPM7/CaMKKβ/AMPK
  are two positive pathways in regulating autophagy'
