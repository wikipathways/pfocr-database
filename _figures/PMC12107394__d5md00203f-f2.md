caption: The impact of the cftr protein on the β-catenin signaling pathway in kidney
  epithelial cells (A) and intestinal non-epithelial (C) cells and epithelial cells
  (B) is illustrated. In kidney epithelial cells (A), the interaction of cftr with
  Dvl-2 has been demonstrated to result in the activation of the destruction complex
  and the subsequent degradation of β-catenin. In non-epithelial cells (B), the interaction
  of CFTR protein with phosphoprotein phosphatase results in its deactivation. consequently,
  the destruction complex is inactivated through the interaction with phosphorylated
  LRP, which allows β-catenin to be transported into the nucleus. Furthermore, CFTR
  has been shown to inhibit DPR1, which promotes the ubiquitination of Dvl2. This,
  in turn, may inhibit the destruction complex. In intestinal epithelial cells (C),
  a reduction in the functionality of the cftr protein consequently leads to an increase
  in intracellular pH, which stabilises the interaction between the wnt receptor and
  Dvl-2 and thus inhibits the destruction complex
