caption: 'Mechanism of action of metformin in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. (A)
  Decrease in de novo lipogenesis: (1) AMPK activation and increase inhibitory phosphorylation
  of ACC; (2) inhibition of ROCK-1 by metformin resulting in inhibitory phosphorylation
  of ACC; and (3) increase in leptin sensitivity attenuates de novo lipogenesis pathway.
  Decreasing fatty acyl CoA also decreases hepatic steatosis, decreases lipid-induced
  ER stress and decreases substrate for FA β-oxidation. (B) Increase in FA β-oxidation:
  (3) increase in leptin sensitivity induces PPARα-dependent FA β-oxidation; (4) up-regulation
  of proteins involved in mitochondrial lipid oxidation by metformin results in increased
  FA breakdown and energy combustion. (C) Decrease in inflammation and HSC activation:
  (5) decreased lipid-induced ER stress and oxidative stress due to decreased de novo
  lipogenesis; (6) TNF-α reduction decreases Kupffer cell and HSC activation resulting
  in reducing inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. (D) Direct degradation of intracellular
