caption: Tools and strategies used to overcome the T5αH bottleneck. (A) Optimization
  of the P450 module in a previously optimized E. coli strain with chromosomally integrated
  MEP and TG modules was achieved using several approaches (see ). Top panel—A high
  copy number plasmid (P10) was compared to a low copy number (P5), and expression
  strength was explored using a strong T7 promoter and a weak (Trc) promoter; Middle
  panel—Using a low copy P5 plasmid and weak Trc promoter, interactions of the P450
  and its reductase partner CPR were explored using a linked chimera construct (L)
  or an unlinked operon design (O); Lower panel—N-terminal modifications were tested
  on truncated versions of T5αH and CPR to enhance solubility using three leader peptides—2B1,
  MA an 8RP; 17α was also used in another study (). Right panel—Further optimizations
  including targeted proteomics and optimization of media and fermentation conditions
  led to highest titers of oxygenated taxanes. (B) Targeting promoters for dynamic
  regulation of T5αH catalysis. Top—Bidirectional promoters (BDPs) that differ in
  inducibility and strength can be used for fine-tuning and timing of expression of
  proteins in the Taxol pathway.  tested this concept and achieved a 50x-improvement
  in taxadiene titers. Lower— introduced riboregulated Switchable feedback promoter
  (rSFP) that uses a natural stress-response promoter (SRP) in combination with a
  second plasmid containing a small transcription activating RNA (STAR) that can be
  induced by an inducer like anhydrotetracycline (ATc) to create an external ON/OFF
  gate that achieved a 2.4-fold increase in oxygenated taxanes compared to . (C) Compartmentalized
  engineering in plant tissue (N. benthamiana) targeting chloroplasts () and cytosol
  () was conducted. Plastid—chloroplastic targeting (blue arrows) resulted in production
  of T-5α-ol for the first time, while cytosolic targeting (red arrows) resulted in
  10-fold increase in taxadiene. Purple arrows—upregulation of HMGR without cytosol-targeted
  tcTXS-tcGGPPS led to 80x increase in an unidentified compound that co-eluted with
  taxadiene. Black arrows—introduction of DXS and TXS-GGPPS without chloroplastic
  targeted chlT5αH-chlCPR results in detection of OCT only. Red dotted arrow, cytosolic
  engineering of taxadiene with further introduction of T5αH-CPR has not yet been
  attempted.
