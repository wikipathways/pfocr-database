  network affected in lymphoblastoid cells derived from an SS patient. IPA network
  4 is centered in the amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), which is also found in
  the WikiPathways for TGFβ signaling and the IPA Canonical Pathway for Reelin signaling
  in neurons. Several olfactory receptor genes are down-regulated and practically
  all of the genes in this causal network.
