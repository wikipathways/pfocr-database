caption: STAT3 signaling pathway. The IL-6 cytokine triggers dimerization and activation
  of the IL6 receptor with its gp130 subunit. JAK phosphorylation in turn results
  in STAT3 phosphorylation, which dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus to upregulate
  target genes associated with stemness and GSC survival. Inhibition of the STAT3
  pathway can be achieved at several points, including targeting of receptor signaling
  using WP1066 or bazedoxifene and inhibition of STAT3 dimerization and signaling
  using Stattic, STA-21, or S31-201. GP130—glycoprotein 130, IL6R—IL6 receptor, P—phosphorylation,
  STAT3—signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
