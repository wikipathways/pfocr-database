caption: Our hypothetical model shows the downregulation of PTEN expression in radiation-resistant
  cells. PTEN expression is downregulated by CpG hypermethylation in the PTEN promoter
  (DNMT1-mediated DNA methylation) and histone hypermethylation in H3K27me3 (EZH2-mediated
  histone methylation), with constitutive activation of the Akt pathway. EPHA3/c-Myc
  could regulate PTEN expression epigenetically by dual mechanisms.
