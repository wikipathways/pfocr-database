caption: 'Physiological effects of heat shock. Immediate consequences of thermal stress
  are depicted as described in the text. Relevant proteins are depicted as colored
  balls. Three response pathways are shown to be induced by heat shock: the CWI (cell
  wall integrity) pathway, the ESR (environmental stress response), and the HSR (heat
  shock response). The physiological effects of ceramide and long-chain base synthesis
  and accumulation after heat shock are unknown.'
