caption: Catalase andnucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK2) played important regulative
  roles in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades pathway. The
  catalase can inhibit the production of H2O2, help cells to remove the harmful effects
  of reactive oxygen species, and result stress-tolerant response. NDPK2 that was
  only expressed in control groups, and due to the phosphorylation of MPK3/6 was not
  observed in treatment groups. Then indirectly affect the transcription factors,
  which were WRKY22 and WRKY25that transcription factor involved in the expression
  of defense genes in innate immune response of plants, could regulate transcription
  process. Ultimately, the expression of related defense enzymes (CAT, POD and SOD)
  were inhibited.
