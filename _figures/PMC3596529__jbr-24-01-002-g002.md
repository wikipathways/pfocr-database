caption: . Scheme of the PTEN/mTOR signaling pathway. In response to receptor tyrosine
  kinase (RTK) activation, PI3K phosphorylates and converts the lipid second messenger
  PIP2 into PIP3, which recruits and activates phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase
  1/2 (PDK1/2). PDK1/2, in turn, phosphorylates and activates Akt. PTEN catalyzes
  the conversion from PIP3 to PIP2. Thus, inactivation of PTEN results in the accumulation
  of PIP3 and the activation of Akt. Akt controls a host of signaling molecules, including
  TSC1/2. Downstream of the TSC1/2 complex lies mTOR, which integrates various cellular
  signals, including nutrient availability to control protein translation, cell growth,
  and other processes. The ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RP-S6) and the eukaryotic
  initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) are the mTOR effector molecules
  executing these functions. Cellular stresses such as hypoxia induce expression of
  Redd1/2, which augments TSC1/2 activity and in turn suppress the mTOR activity.
