caption: The role of TSPs in bone remodeling. In early-stage OA, subchondral bone
  is mainly characterized by osteoclasts-mediated bone resorption. Subchondral bone
  becomes porous with enlargement of trabecular gap and bone marrow cavity. Angiogenesis
  and sensory innervation were increased within subchondral bone. The TSPs play different
  roles in osteoclastogenesis. TSP-1 activates osteoclastogenesis through promoting
  proliferation and fusion of osteoclasts precursors, additionally, it acts as a major
  regulator of latent TGF-β activation released during bone resorption. TSP-2 facilitates
  the fusion of osteoclasts precursors and RANKL-dependent osteoclasts formation.
  In late-stage OA, subchondral bone is mainly characterized by osteoblast-mediated
  bone formation. Subchondral bone demonstrates increased bone density, bone volume,
  as well as decreased calcium to collagen ratio, bone mineralization, and mechanical
  stiffness. TSP-2 inhibits the proliferation and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs,
  and promotes osteogenic differentiation and bone deposition. TSP-1 and TSP-5 promote
  MSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation through activating TGF-β/smad
  signaling pathway
