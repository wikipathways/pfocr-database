caption: In response to calcium, the calcineurin/NFAT pathway activation favors T-plastin
  synthesis in keratinocytes. As a consequence, T-plastin through actin-bundling and
  stabilization of the actin network, will act on FAK expression and autophosphorylation
  as well as on β6-integrin expression. Altogether, this cascade will promote migration
  of human keratinocytes.
