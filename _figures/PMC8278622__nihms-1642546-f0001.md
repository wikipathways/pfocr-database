caption: 'The intersection among ER, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and CDK/Rb/E2F pathways, with
  cyclin D1 a notable common node, along with therapeutics targeting PI3K, ER, and
  CDK4/6. Cyclin D1 plays a central role in regulating cell cycle progression through
  binding CDK4/6, leading to a cascade of phosphorylation events on Rb tumor suppressor
  protein, causing its uncoupling from E2 factor (E2F) transcription factors, allowing
  them to traverse into the nucleus and induce transcription of genes promoting G1/S
  phase transition. Cyclin D1 can complex with estrogen receptor (ER) and thereby
  induce ligand-independent transcriptional activity of ER; estrogen (E) may also
  induce cyclin D1 expression to drive cell cycle progression. Downstream effectors
  of PI3K/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) – S6K and Eukaryotic initiation factor 4-binding
  protein 1 (4E-BP1) – induce translation of cyclin D1, while AKT stabilizes cyclin
  D1 via inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), a kinase that facilitates
  proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 through phosphorylation. The ER pathway is targeted
  by fulvestrant (an ER degrader) or Tamoxifen (an ER modulator) along with goserelin
  (a GnRH agonist, not shown). Inhibition of CDK4/6 is achieved with ribociclib. PIK3K
  110ɑ is inhibited by alpelisib or buparlisib. Abbreviations: E (Estrogen). P2 (Phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5)-bisphosphate aka PIP2). P3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate aka
  PIP3).'
