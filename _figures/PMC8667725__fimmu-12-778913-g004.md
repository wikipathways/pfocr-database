caption: Interactions between the components of the immune system and coagulation
  cascades that induce thrombosis in COVID-19. In brief, the SARS-CoV-2 infection
  triggers an inflammatory response in the alveolar lumen by macrophages and neutrophils.
  Overexpression of PAI-1 and its interaction with TLR4 induce the IL-6 expression
  and STAT3 activation in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Subsequent production of
  inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α causes neutrophils to
  be recruited and release Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). NETs directly activate
  factor XII, thereby activating the contact-dependent clotting pathway. The PAR-1
  receptor mediates cytokine-dependent Tissue Factor (TF) activation, which stimulates
  the STAT3/PAI-1 complex in blood’s monocytes and enhances inflammatory cytokine
  production leading to extrinsic coagulation cascade activation and thrombosis formation.
  Moreover, inflammatory cytokine in combination with the direct binding of SARS-CoV-2
  to the endothelial cells triggers Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) secretion cleaved
  by ADAMTS13 to the regular size. Activated TF/VWF/FVIII complex in cooperation with
  NETs recruits platelets to adhere to endothelial surfaces and provoke intrinsic
  coagulation cascades. Altogether these events ultimately driving thrombin formation
  from circulating prothrombin, which cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin and stimulates
  thrombosis formation. Besides, suppression of endothelial enzymes and Plasminogen
  Activators (tPA/uPA) would aggravate the coagulopathy state by preventing effective
  fibrinolysis. Both tPA and uPA participate in the normal coagulation-plasmin-fibrin
  pathway, can be inhibited by PAI-1/HIF-1α in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS.
