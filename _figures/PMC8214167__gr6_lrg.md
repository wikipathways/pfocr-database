caption: Model of potential impacts of KD associated genetic variants PELI1, ITPKC,
  FCGR2A, and genetic polymorphisms in STING and STAT3 on TLR/inflammasome/IFN dysregulation,
  which might lead to predisposition to COVID-19 related MIS-C. Components of SARS-CoV-2
  and viral associated PAMPs/DAMPs are shown in green. The spike protein can activate
  TLR2/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines,
  and priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The single-strand viral RNA can stimulate
  TLR7/TLR8, and double-strand RNA produced during viral replication can stimulate
  TLR3 in the endosome, which activate IRF and NF-κB signaling. The M gene product
  (membrane protein) can stimulate TBK1/IRF3/IFNB1 pathway and TLR-related NF-κB signaling.
  STING can be activated by viral related host DNA damage via IFI16, or can be stimulated
  directly by product of RNA virus and cell fusion, leading to type I IFN production.
  PELI1 is a negative regulator of NF-κB, while STAT3 is a positive regulator of NF-κB.
  FcγRIIA mediates IgG-immune complex induced NF-κB signaling and priming of NLRP3
  inflammasome activation. ITPKC regulates IP3-mediated calcium release and subsequent
  NLRP inflammasome activation.
