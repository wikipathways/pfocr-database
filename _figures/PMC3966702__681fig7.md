caption: ABCA1 expression and function can be induced by GPR119 to protect from atherosclerosis.
  Ox-LDL upregulates lincRNA-DYNLRB2-2 expression, resulting in increased ABCA1 expression
  through GPR119. GLP-1R-mediated signaling pathways including CaMK, cAMP/PKA, PI-3K/AKT/PKB,
  MAPK-ERK1/2, and PKC-ζ are involved in GPR119-induced ABCA1 expression. Moreover,
  GPR119 inhibits inflammation and promotes apoA-I-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux
  through inducing ABCA1 expression. These beneficial effects are accompanied by a
  reduction of macrophage-derived foam cell formation, inhibition of inflammatory
  gene expression, adhesion molecule expression in the aorta, and increase of cholesterol
  efflux from peripheral tissues, thus preventing of atherosclerotic plaque formation.
papertitle: A lincRNA-DYNLRB2-2/GPR119/GLP-1R/ABCA1-dependent signal transduction
  pathway is essential for the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis.
