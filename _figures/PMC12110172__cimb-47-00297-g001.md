caption: Overview of the Hippo-YAP pathway. Upon activation of the Hippo signaling
  pathway, the downstream Hippo effectors YAP/TAZ are phosphorylated by the Hippo
  core kinases Lats1/2, leading to their retention in the cytoplasm and subsequent
  degradation. Conversely, when the Hippo signaling is inactivated, YAP/TAZ functions
  as transcriptional cofactors that translocate into the nucleus and interact with
  other transcription factors, such as members of the TEA domain transcription factor
  family (TEADs), to regulate gene expression. Created in BioRender. SHEN, J. (2025)
