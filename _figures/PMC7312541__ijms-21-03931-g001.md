caption: Overview of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin
  is phosphorylated by the destruction complex consisting of Axin, adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC), and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, which leads to its degradation.
  In the presence of Wnt, this ligand interacts with its receptor complex consisting
  of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) and Frizzled (FZD).
  This results in the activation of Disheveled (DSH) and subsequent inactivation of
  GSK-3β. As a result, β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and translocates to the
  nucleus where it activates transcription of specific target genes through interaction
  with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors.
  CHIR99021 is a selective inhibitor of GSK-3β and, therefore, increases the cytosolic
  levels of β-catenin, which allows nuclear translocation of active β-catenin. C59
  and IWP2 are both inhibitors for Wnt production and secretion, while XAV939 and
  IWR1-endo inhibit Wnt signaling via stabilization of the APC/Axin/GSK-3β destruction
  complex of β-catenin.
