caption: The Kynurenic pathway, glutamate, and neuroplasticity. (1) 95% of free, extracellular
  tryptophan is converted into KYN via IDO and TDO. BD, stress, and metabolic disease
  augment this conversion, decreasing free serotonin/melatonin with resultant increases
  in oxidative/inflammatory signaling. (2) Inside astrocytes, KYN is converted into
  KynA, which exerts a net neuroprotective effect by several mechanisms. (3) Through
  extra-synaptic NMDA-inhibition, ketamine shunts glutamate towards AMPA receptors
  and blocks QA influx, ultimately upregulating BDNF-mediated synaptic plasticity,
  in concert with an increase in KynA/QA ratio (NMDA receptor-kynurenic competition).
  (4) Inside microglia, KYN is converted to 3-HK and QA which exert various neurotoxic
  effects. (5) Proinflammatory cytokines increase QA production by increasing IDO
  activity and shunting tryptophan into microglia. This in turn amplifies the inflammatory
  signal, causing influx of peripheral immune cells, which exponentiate QA production
  and subsequent toxicity. (6) Under chronic stress (HPA overactivity), cortisol loses
  its feedback inhibition on pro-inflammatory signals, and continues to upregulate
  QA production though TDO/IDO induction and IFN-γ modulation, exacerbating the neurotoxic/inflammatory
  environment (discussed in Sect. ). (7) Astrocytic processes form a “cradle” (left
  side) around synaptic connections and serve as the major site for glutamate reuptake,
  limiting excess glutamate spillover into extrasynaptic NMDA receptors. Astrocytes
  also exert negative feedback (not shown) to suppress microglial overactivation.
  Chronic inflammation, exacerbated by acute mood episodes (right side) disrupts the
  astrocytic cradle and impairs feedback mechanisms, resulting in extracellular glutamate
  accumulation and microglial overactivation. Activated microglia do engage in modest
  glutamate reuptake, but it is suppressed by QA and outpaced by their immune-stimulated
  release of various toxic metabolites (QA, ROS, Glutamate, cytokines, damaged organelles,
  etc.). Extrasynaptic NMDA activation suppresses BDNF expression, impairing synaptic
  homeostasis. Ultimately these signals result in a chronic reciprocal exacerbation
  of glutamate excitotoxicity, inflammation, and overall neurotoxicity (discussed
  in Sect. )
