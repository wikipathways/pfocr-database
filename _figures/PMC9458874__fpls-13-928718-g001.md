caption: Schematic drawing of the ABA signaling pathway for the RD29A expression.
  ABA signaling core components and their interactions are shown with and without
  ABA. In the presence of ABA, downstream regulators ABF and DREB2A bind ABRE and
  DRE, the cis-elements on the RD29A gene, leading to its transient expression. The
  drawing was modified from the figure in (). P with a circle represents the phosphorylation
  of a protein. A different number of arrowheads indicates a different level of gene
  expression. X indicates no gene expression.
