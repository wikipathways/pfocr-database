caption: 'The two main Ca2+ channels regulating T cell metabolism are the store-operated
  CRAC channel and the purinergic P2RX7 channel. (1) CRAC channels formed by ORAI
  family proteins in the plasma membrane mediate store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)
  in response to TCR stimulation. TCR signaling results in production of IP3, release
  of Ca2+ from the ER through IP3 receptor channels (not shown) and activation of
  STIM1 and STIM2 proteins in the ER membrane, which subsequently bind to and open
  ORAI channels. SOCE activates many Ca2+ dependent enzymes including calcineurin,
  CaMK and adenylyl cyclases as well as transcription factors such as NFAT and CREB.
  SOCE has emerged as an important regulator of several metabolic pathways: (a) Activation
  of calcineurin and NFAT downstream of TCR-induced SOCE regulates, both directy and
  indirectly through NFAT regulated transcription factors such as IRF4 and HIF-1α,
  the expression of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, which allows CD4+
  and CD8+ T cells to grow, enter the cell cycle and proliferate. (b) SOCE activates
  the PI3-AKT-mTORC1 pathway at the posttranslational level further promoting glycolytic
  metabolism. (c) SOCE enhances the expression of nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes
  that are components of the ETC, resulting in increased OXPHOS and ATP production.
  Impaired expression of ETC genes and redox regulation in SOCE-deficient T cells
  results in high mROS levels and the death of pTh17 cells. (d) In non-immune cells,
  SOCE regulates the expression of two transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism,
  PPARα and PGC1α, and the activation of the transcription factor CREB via the production
  of cAMP, which control several aspects of lipid metabolism such as expression of
  neutral lipases and lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation and lipophagy (not shown). Note
  that activation of ORAI1 is inhibited by FFAs. (2) Activation of the P2RX7 channel
  by extracellular ATP regulates activation of AMPK and OXPHOS in memory CD8+ T cells,
  presumably by mediating Ca2+ influx. “?” indicates pathways whose role in lymphocyte
  metabolism remain to be elucidated. For additional details see the main text. Abbreviations:
