caption: The upper panel shows that in HSPC, KDM4A-AS1 is under-expressed, MDM2 antagonizes
  USP14 and binds to AR. AR protein is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway
  after being ubiquitinated by MDM2. The lower part shows that in CRPC, KDM4A-AS1
  is highly expressed and stabilizes the USP14-AR/AR-Vs complex, KDM4A-AS1 enhances
  the deubiquitination of AR/AR-Vs, prevents AR/AR-Vs from being degraded by MDM2,
  and further promotes the progress of CRPC.
papertitle: Targeting KDM4A-AS1 represses AR/AR-Vs deubiquitination and enhances enzalutamide
  response in CRPC.
