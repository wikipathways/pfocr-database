caption: iPSC-based drug testing to treat Parkinson’s Disease. The main pathological
  characteristics of PD are the presence of Lewy bodies (aggregation and accumulation
  of the protein α-synuclein), which cause mitochondrial disfunctions, endoplasmatic
  reticulum (ER) stress and Golgi degradation, leading to cell death in the brain’s
  basal ganglia. Human iPSC-derived dopaminergic models have facilitated the study
  of PD, providing amenable systems for drug discovery as well. Promising results
  derive from drugs targeting the glucocerebrosidase (GCase) pathway. Inactive GCase
  (in red) can be restored in active GCase (in green) directly using GCase chaperones
  NCGC758, NCGC607 and novel small molecules, such as S-181, or indirectly using Quinazoline
  modulators able to trig GCase activator. These compounds reduce lysosome accumulation
  of α-synuclein in both wildtype and mutant GCase patient-specific iPSC-derived dopaminergic
  neurons. SNCA aggregates can also be directly targeted by small molecules NPT100-18A,
  NPT100-14A and their derivatives, which are able to revert the degenerative phenotype.
  Different drugs, such as isoxazole, coenzyme Q10, rapamycin and GW5074 (a LRRK2
  kinase inhibitor) have been tested in iPSC-DA models showing effects in increasing
  mitochondria respiration and biogenesis. The stress of ER is another drug target
  to treat PD. A novel unfolded protein response (UPR) modulator, azoramide restore
  ER function in PLA2G6 D331Y mutant DA neurons. Illustrations used elements from
  Servier Medical Art (www.servier.fr/servier-medical-art).
