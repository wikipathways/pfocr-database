caption: A representative schematic of the proposed TRIF contribution to NF-κB-dependent
  TNFα promoter activation. LPS activates TLR4 at the cell surface resulting in MyD88
  activation via Mal. LPS also promotes TLR4 endocytosis following association with
  CD14 in the presence of the LPS-binding protein (LBP). TLR4 in the endosome subsequently
  recruits TRIF via TRAM. TLR4 signalling is transduced sequentially through the MyD88-dependent
  pathway from the cell membrane and the TRIF-dependent pathway from the endosome.
  Signals through MyD88-dependent and TRIF-dependent pathways distinctly activate
  IκB kinase (IKK) via the TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and the kinase
  receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1). Activated IKK causes phosphorylation and
  degradation of IκB followed by NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  NF-κB activates several promoters. NF-κB requires the cooperation of TRIF-dependent
  signalling to activate the TNFα promoter. NF-κB also activates promoters of negative
  regulators including IκB and A20. IκB inactivates NF-κB and leads it to shuttle
  out of the nucleus. A20 suppresses IKK through inhibition of the upstream signalling.
papertitle: Lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-κB nuclear translocation is primarily dependent
  on MyD88, but TNFα expression requires TRIF and MyD88.
