caption: 'Ketone bodies in liver-brain axis. Ketone body BHB made by the liver could
  cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and contribute to the brain function. This liver-brain
  axis is the typical pathway of BHB and acetoacetate (AcAc) from liver and brain.
  During fasting, fatty acid changes into BHB through acetyl coenzyme-A. BHB and AcAc
  cross the BBB and enter neurons through an MCT channel. Next, BHB and AcAc contribute
  to the secretion of BDNF and the improvement of synapse plasticity.,Abbreviations:
