caption: Identification of molecular pathways that are altered by Atbf1 inactivation
  in mouse prostates. Genes differentially expressed between Atbf1-positive and Atbf1–negative
  prostates, along with their expression levels, were imported to the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA) program to construct interacting pathways. The four networks with
  the smallest P values are shown. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree
  of upregulation (red) or downregulation (green) in Atbf1-null prostates. Solid and
  dashed lines indicate direct and indirect interactions respectively. Different shapes
  of the nodes, including square, circle, diamond, rectangles etc., represent functional
  classification of the genes.
