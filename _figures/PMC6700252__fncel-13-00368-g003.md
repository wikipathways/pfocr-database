caption: Intrinsic intracellular signaling cascades of BDNF-TrkB and TrkB-A2a receptors.
  BDNF-TrkB activation predominantly initiates MAPK, PI3K, and PLC γ signaling pathways.
  Activation of the TrkB receptor at its Tyr490 and Tyr515 residue recruits Shc adaptor
  protein leading to binding of growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (grb2) which
  binds with GTPase Ras to form a complex and initiate extracellular signal regulated
  kinase (ERK) activation which in turn activates the mitogen activated protein kinase
  MAPK/ERK pathway, which results in the activation of CREB transcription factor.
  Activation of Tyr515 residue also activates the PI3K signaling pathway, incorporating
  combined actions of Ras and activating the PI3/Akt and MEK/MAPK pathways. Both MAPK
  and PI3K signaling exert neurotrophic functions of survival, growth and differentiation,
  via activation transcription factors (CREB and C-myc). Phosphorylation of the TrkB
  receptor at its Tyr816 residue activates the phospholipase C γ (PLC γ) pathway,
  generating inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The PLCγ/IP3
  pathway results in calcium release from intracellular stores, in turn activating
  Ca2+/CaMKII. DAG activates PKC, leading to synaptic plasticity. pro-BDNF/p75 initiates
  JNK signaling (; ; ) triggering neuronal apoptosis (), and the NF-κB signaling cascade
  regulation of neuronal growth cone development and navigation, and neuronal survival.
  Like BDNF, neuronal activity promotes release of adenosine which binds to A2aRs
  to activate adenylyl cyclase leading to production of cAMP further activating PKA
  downstream which controls Ca2+ dependent BDNF release. Activation of A2aRs also
  transactivates TrkB, initiating the TrkB-Akt pathway promoting neuronal survival.
