caption: The combination of DSF/Cu and chemotherapeutic drugs sensitizes breast cancer
  (BC) cells and their stem cells by targeting various cellular and signaling mechanisms.
  (a) DSF sensitizes BC cells by inhibiting p-glycoprotein (Pgp) or inducing apoptosis
  and autophagy through the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also sensitizes
  BC cells by inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stemness via
  the targeting of NF-kB-dependent TGF. DSF further sensitizes BC cells by inhibiting
  ERK/Snail-dependent mammosphere formation and inhibiting BC cell proliferation by
  blocking the Akt pathway. Moreover, DSF enhances antitumor immunity by inhibiting
  myeloid-derived suppressor cells or activating CAR-T cells. (b) The combination
  of DSF/Cu with paclitaxel (PTX), doxorubicin (DOX), cisplatin (CIS), and 6-thioguanine
  (6-TG) triggers ROS, which in turn induces apoptosis by upregulating BAX expression
  via the JNK/MAPK signaling pathway in breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). ROS also
  induces autophagy by activating FOXP3 signaling and reduces mammosphere formation
  in BCSCs by inhibiting ALDH1 via targeting transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4.
  Additionally, ROS inhibits the proliferation of BCSCs by inhibiting survivin via
  targeting STAT3 or inducing cell cycle arrest by causing DNA damage. Furthermore,
  ROS inhibits BCSCs within the tumor by inducing ferroptosis by triggering mitochondrial
  atrophy
