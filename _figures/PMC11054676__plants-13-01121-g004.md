caption: 'Color pathway map of DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in starch–sucrose
  metabolic pathway. The difference-expressed genes shared by CK vs. ETH and CK vs.
  1-MCP groups were marked with different color lines: red lines: β-glucosidase plays
  a role in promoting sucrose to produce glucose; green lines: beta-amylase plays
  a role in the production of starch and glucose from sucrose; blue lines: pgm works
  to produce glucose from sucrose; black lines: others'
