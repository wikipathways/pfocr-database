caption: Regulation of Akt signaling pathways after (A) vehicle, and (B) melatonin
  treatments following ischemic-stroke. Akt is activated via its upstream kinase PDK1,
  while PTEN is a major negative regulator of Akt signaling. When phosphorylated,
  inhibitory effect of PTEN on PI3K/Akt is decreased. Activated Akt stimulates mTOR
  phosphorylation, which is a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, proliferation
  and survival. Both Akt and mTOR are negative regulators of p53 phosphorylation.
  Here we demonstrated that melatonin activated Akt, PDK1, PTEN, mTOR and AMPKα phosphorylation.
  Furthermore, AMPKα was demonstrated to be activated via a PI3K independent pathway
  as it was not deactivated by IP3K inhibition. It is possible that AMPKα is activated
  by decreased ATP levels due to anabolic reactions stimulated by Akt and hypoxia.
  Therefore, phosphorylated AMPKα stimulates catabolic pathways to generate ATP from
  alternative pathways such as fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, melatonin activated
  RSK1 phosphorylation and reduced 4E-BP1, GSK-3α/β, S6 ribosomal protein and p53
  phosphorylation. GSK-3α and GSK-3β are critical players in the activation of apoptosis.
  Both proteins are deactivated by phosphorylation of Akt and RSK1. GSK-3β is not
  only inhibited by Akt, but also provides a strong link between Akt and p53. Finally,
  reduced p53 phosphorylation resulted in decreased apoptosis. In addition, PRAS40
  phosphorylation was slightly increased, whereas ERK-1/2 and Bad phosphorylation
  were decreased after melatonin treatment. Thus, our data provide evidence for how
  melatonin utilizes PI3K/Akt pathway to protect neurons after ischemia.
