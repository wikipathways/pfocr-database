caption: 'Pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy. Hyperglycemia activates numerous
  metabolic pathways like polyol pathway, protein kinase c (PKC) pathway, advanced
  glycation end products (AGE) pathway, and hexosamine pathway. All these pathways
  are known to integrate through hyperglycemia mediated mitochondrial ROS production.
  Oxidative stress and these classical pathways in combination activate transcription
  factors such as nuclear factor kappa enhancer of B cells (NF-κB) and speciality
  protein-1 (SP-1), resulting in neuroinflammation and vascular impairment. Further,
  these pathways combined with dysfunctional mitochondria mediated apoptosis or bioenergetic
  depletion can lead to neuronal damage lading to DN. Poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)
  mediated NADH/ATP depletion can lead to neuronal dysfunction due to failure of various
  energy dependent processes in neurons. (ERK: extracellular related kinase, IL-6:
  interleukin-6, iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase, COX-2: cyclooxygenase-2, TGF-β:
  transforming growth factor-β, and PAI-1: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.)'
