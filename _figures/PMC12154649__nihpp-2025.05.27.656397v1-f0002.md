caption: 'A) Structures of fosfazinomycin, kinamycin, and lomaiviticin. B) The conserved
  hydrazino cassette of genes found in the fzm, kin, and lom biosynthetic gene clusters.
  C) The roles of most of the components of this pathway have been identified, but
  the role of the enzymes responsible for N–N bond formation (dashed box) remained
  purely hypothetical. The biosynthetic pathway splits off after the production of
  l-hydrazinoglutarate: for kinamycin and lomaiviticin, an O-methyltransferase-like
  enzyme installs the diazo group on the benzofluorene scaffold,28 while the subsequent
  pathway in fosfazinomycin has not yet been confirmed'
