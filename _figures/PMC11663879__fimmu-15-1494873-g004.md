caption: Molecular mechanism and RNA modification with their functions in Macrophage.
  (A) FTO activates the NF-κB signalling pathway, boosting the mRNA stability of STAT1
  and PPAR-γ through YTHDF2 participation, thereby promoting M1 macrophage activation.
  (B) FTO increases the mRNA stability of STAT1 and PPAR-γ, promoting M2 macrophage
  activation. (C) circ_0066715 up-regulated the expression of the target gene ETS1
  and exerted a miRNA sponge-like impact of miR-486-5p. WTAP also contributes to the
  promotion of the expression of ETS1. m6A regulatory mechanism and the circRNA/miRNA/mRNA
  regulatory axis are involved in the polarisation process of RA macrophages
