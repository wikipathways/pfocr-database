caption: Schematic illustration of MAPK-signaling pathway with 5 selected genes (Ssk1,
  Pbs2, Ste11, Hog1, and Ssk2), known to be associated with response to osmotic stress.
  Green and red boxes indicate the gene is active (log2-FC > 0) in 20% and 10% glucose
  (log2-FC < 0) treatment, respectively (see also ). The pathway was obtained from
  the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) database.
