caption: Wnt/B-catenin signalling pathway activated upon binding with Wnt to membrane
  receptors. Cell membrane segment composed of Wnt Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6.
  Cytoplasmic segment composed of β-catenin and a ‘destruction complex’ involving
  glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), casein kinase 1 (CK1), Axin, and adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC) that degrades β-catenin in the absence of Wnt ligands. Meanwhile,
  dishevelled (DvL) proteins upon activation recruits Axin and GSK-3β to plasma membrane
  to inhibit their functions, consequently de-phosphorylates β-catenin and leads to
  their accumulation. Lastly, nuclear segment composed of β-catenin that translocates
  into the nucleus, TCF/LEF and β-catenin target genes
