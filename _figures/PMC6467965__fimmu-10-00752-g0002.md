caption: Schematic presentation of the cytotoxic pathways, induced in cancer cells
  by the complement C5b-9, the counteractive cellular resistance mechanisms, and postulated
  approaches to overcome this cancer evasion. Following the binding of antibodies
  to cancer cells, the complement system is activated and deposits C4b and C3b molecules
  that serve as initiators of C3/C5 convertase activation. The C5 convertases initiate
  the activation of the terminal complement pathway and the formation of the C5b-9
  complexes (). Upon insertion of the C5b-9 complexes into the plasma membrane of
  cancer cells, they induce calcium ion influx and activate pro- and anti-lytic signals.
  This scheme depicts the proteins proposed to be involved in the ensuing cancer cell
  death (encircled) and the proteins protecting the cancer cells from the lytic processes.
  Extracellular (gray boxes) and intracellular (purple boxes) protective proteins
  are indicated. Several reagents (white boxes) that will block the protective proteins
  are indicated and proposed for adjuvant therapy to therapeutic antibodies. Ab, antibody;
  Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2; BH3, Bcl-2 homolog domain-3; Bid, BH3 interacting
  domain death agonist; CK2, casein kinase 2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; HSP90, heat shock protein 90; HSP70, heat shock protein 70; JNK, c-jun N-terminal
  kinase; MAC, complement membrane attack complex; MLKL, mixed lineage kinase domain-like
  protein; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PKC, protein kinase C; RIPK1, receptor-interacting
  protein kinase 1; RIPK3, receptor-interacting protein kinase 3; serine-, serine
  protease; siRNA, small interfering RNA.
