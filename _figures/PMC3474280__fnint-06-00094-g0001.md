caption: 'Central position of the locus coeruleus in relation to the acoustic startle
  reflex and pupillary light reflex pathways. Red: excitatory connections; blue: inhibitory
  connections. The acoustic startle response is triggered by a sound stimulus activating
  auditory receptors in the cochlea. Auditory signals are transmitted via two nuclei
  of auditory processing, the ventral cochlear nucleus and ventral nucleus of the
  lateral lemniscus, to a relay nucleus in the pontine reticular formation, nucleus
  reticularis pontis caudalis, which projects directly to bulbar and spinal motoneurones.
  The startle response consists of the sudden synchronized contraction of a large
  array of facial and skeletal muscles. The locus coeruleus has a facilitatory influence
  on the motor neurones via an excitatory noradrenergic output involving the stimulation
  of α1-adrenoceptors. Painful stimuli, via activation of the locus coeruleus can
  enhance the acoustic startle response (“sensitization”). The reflex response can
  also be enhanced by fear-conditioning via the amygdala. The lateral nucleus of the
  amygdala processes the association between aversive (painful) unconditioned (UCS)
  stimuli and neutral (e.g., light) conditioned (CS) stimuli, and the arising conditioned
  fear signal is transmitted, via the central nucleus of the amygdala, to the nucleus
  reticularis pontis caudalis, leading to the enhancement of the reflex response (“fear-potentiation”).
  The amygdala also projects to the locus coeruleus, whose activation by conditioned
  fear contributes to the fear-potentiation of the acoustic startle response. The
  pupillary light reflex is a parasympathetic autonomic reflex. Light signals stimulate
  photoreceptors in the retina which project, via melanopsin-containing intrinsically
  photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), to the pretectal nucleus, a parasympathetic
  premotor nucleus: this leads to activation of the reflex pathway via the chain Edinger
  Westphal nucleus (preganglionic neurones) → ciliary ganglion (postganlionic neurones).
  The reflex response is the contraction of the smooth muscle fibres of the sphincter
  pupillae muscle, leading to pupil constriction (miosis). The locus coeruleus has
  inhibitory influence on the preganglionic neurones via a noradrenergic projection
  involving α2-adrenoceptors. As the locus coeruleus can be activated by the amygdala,
  it transmits conditioned fear signals to the Edinger Westphal nucleus, leading to
  the attenuation of the light reflex response by conditioned fear (“fear-inhibition”).'
