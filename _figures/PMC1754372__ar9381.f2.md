caption: Schematic drawing of a salivary gland with a high endothelial venule, representing
  the lymphocyte traffic, the role of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)/leucocyte
  function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), the formation of Th1- and Th2-like lymphocytes,
  and the key regulatory cytokines and their interactions in SS. The imbalance in
  Th1-like cells, producing proinflammatory cytokines, and Th2- like cells, results
  in local inflammation. The T-B cell interaction represents a pathway leading to
  autoantibody formation. This inflammatory microenvironment might result in tissue
  damage and disruption of secretory function. Also, note that the salivary gland
  epithelial cell can function as an antigen presenting cell (APC). Th1, T helper
  1-like lymphocytes; Th2, T helper 2-like lymphocytes; Lymph, lymphocytes.
