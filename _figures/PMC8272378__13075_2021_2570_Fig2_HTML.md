caption: Is altered skeletal muscle metabolism linked to fueling chronic inflammation?
  Figure summarizes skeletal muscle cellular metabolic pathways that may contribute
  to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) chronic inflammation based on differentially expressed
  RA muscle genes that are highly associated with disease activity score in 28 joints
  (DAS-28) (*) or improvements in DAS-28 following high-intensity interval training
  (HIIT) (#). Genes included in the pathways diagram are either highly associated
  (Spearman’s rho p < 0.001) or part of significantly associated ingenuity canonical
  pathways (p < 0.05). Genes whose expression significantly (p < 0.05) changes following
  HIIT are listed ($). Based on direction of positive (↑) or negative (↓) associations,
  genes whose function is to promote/upregulate (blue) or inhibit/downregulate (red)
  a specific pathway are highlighted. Bolded arrows represent proposed upregulated
  pathways. Dashed arrows represent proposed downregulated pathways. Green end-dotted
  arrows represent hypothesized pathways in which altered skeletal muscle metabolism
  may contribute to chronic immune-activation and inflammation in RA
