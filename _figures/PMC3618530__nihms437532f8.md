caption: Schematic presentation of the pathway for interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced
  human corneal endothelial cell (CEC) migration that is mediated by fibroblast growth
  factor-2 (FGF2) expression dependent on parallel activator protein-1 (AP-1) and
  nuclear factor -κB (NF-κB) activation. Binding of IL-1β to interleukin 1 receptor
  1 results in assembly of the canonical signaling components, including interleukin
  receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1/4 and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated
  factor (TRAF) 6, that in turn activates PI 3-kinase. This leads to parallel activation
  of NF-κB and AP-1 resulting in FGF2 expression and enhanced human CEC migration.
