caption: (A) NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasome activation in epithelial and myeloid cells
  and the release of IL-1β and IL-18 during oral and systemic candidiasis are instrumental
  components of the inflammatory response, ultimately orchestrating both innate and
  adaptive immunity to eliminate the fungus. (B) During VVC, hyphae- and hypha-associated
  virulence factors induce a powerful NLRP3 inflammasome and inflammatory response
  that drives the recruitment of large numbers of neutrophils to the site of inflammation.
  Host genetic variations in inflammasome and other pathways likely influence VVC
  susceptibility and hyperreactivity to the fungus. An imbalance of NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation and its IL-22/NLRC4/IL-1Ra negative feedback pathway also contributes
  to hyperinflammation and disease pathogenesis. (C) A combination of environmental
  (e.g., diet, antibiotics, and antifungals) and host genetic factors can promote
  dysbiosis and loss of intestinal immune homeostasis. Impaired mucosal barrier function
  and dysregulated antimicrobial immune responses result in uncontrolled chronic inflammation.
  In the genetically susceptible host, impaired inflammasome-mediated anti-Candida
  responses contribute to intestinal inflammation and IBD pathogenesis. CARD-9, caspase
