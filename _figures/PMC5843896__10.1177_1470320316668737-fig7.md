caption: Our working model. In brief, overexpression of the intrarenal angiotensinogen
  gene in RPTCs via elevated ROS generation mediates Nrf2 activation with an impaired
  Nrf2 translocation pattern. Angiotensinogen overexpression in RPTCs promotes and
  inhibits the phosphorylation of pGSK Y216 (active form) and pGSK S9 (inactive form),
  respectively. Consequently, nuclear export of Nrf2 activity is enhanced, resulting
  in the accumulation of Nrf2 in the cytosol, and decreased Nrf2 expression in nuclei,
  which fails to trigger HO-1 expression as a defence mechanism and subsequently diminishes
  AQP1 expression in RPTCs. Concomitantly, the depleted AQP1 expression through β-catenin-dependent
  signalling further contributes to intrarenal RAS-induced nephropathy and hypertension
  (via NHE3).
