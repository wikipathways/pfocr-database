caption: 'In this model, the gene stochastically switches between three states: two
  active states, S10 and S11, and one inactive state S0. Gene activation occurs in
  two steps, initially by the binding of transcription factors (at rate , reversible
  at rate ), and then as a secondary step by the binding and pause of the mRNA polymerase
  (at rate ). Transitions from S11 to S0 also occur at rate , due to detachment of
  both the transcriptional factors and polymerase. Transcription of nascent mRNA (at
  rate ) occurs only in state S11 and results in immediate transition to state S10.
  Nascent mRNA mature at rate , and are subsequently translated into protein at rate
  . Degradation of mRNA and protein occur with rates  and , respectively. We verify
  our pathway reporter method on three variations of the multiscale model. First,
  we assume all reactions are first-order Poisson processes (Case (2) in the main
  text). We then incorporate further details of the mRNA maturation process, where
  nascent mRNA occurs after a fixed amount of time (Case (3)). Finally, we incorporate
  features of the cell-cycle such as gene replication, dosage compensation, cell division,
  and cell-cycle length variability, as well as incorporating more realistic Erlang
  distributed maturation times (Case (4)).'
