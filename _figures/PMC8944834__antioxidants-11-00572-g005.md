caption: Mitochondrial dynamics through the 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
  kinase-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (AMPK-PGC-1α)
  system, with increased expression of nuclear factor erythroid 1-related factor (Nrf-1),
  nuclear factor erythroid 1-related factor (Nrf-2), myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2),
  and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). At the same time, in the AMPK
  pathway, an improvement in glycemic status can be observed, through translocation
  of glucose transporter GLUT4 in the cellular membrane. Regarding the immune system,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) enhance the activity of mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) and nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-kB), which further favors interleukin
  and cytokine secretion (IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, TNF).
