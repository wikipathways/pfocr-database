caption: Simplified scheme depicting the basic signaling pathways defined in ischemic
  preconditioning in mammals. Triggering pathways include activation of the NMDA and
  adenosine A1 receptors which in turn are involved in activating the epsilon isoform
  of protein kinase C. This pathway is known to protect mammalian neurons from excitotoxicity
  and against mitochondrial dysfunction.
