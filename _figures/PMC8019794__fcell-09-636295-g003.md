caption: Macroautophagy pathway and signaling. Macroautophagy is activated following
  various stimulation under cellular stress conditions. The autophagic pathway typically
  includes several steps including (1) initiation, (2) phagophore formation, (3) elongation/expansion,
  (4) autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and (5) degradation. mTOR and AMPK regulates
  the initiation process with AMPK acting as an activator while mTOR acts as an inhibitor.
  Under cellular stress, mTOR reduces its inhibition on the ULK1-FIP200-ATG13 complex,
  whereas AMPK reduces mTORC activity and directs ULK-1 to the site of autophagy.
  The ULK-1 complex regulates the nucleation and phagophore formation process through
  the recruitment of VPS34 and the formation of PI3P. PI3P then contributes to the
  phagophore formation through the signaling of WIPI2B and DFCP to drive the phagophore
  formation. A double-membrane vesicle (phagophore) begins to form and elongate into
  an autophagosome through two ubiquitin-like conjugation cascades, the ATG5-ATG12
  and the LC3 systems. The LC3 is first processed to LC3-I by ATG4B and then activated
  by ATG7. LC3-I is later transformed into LC3-II via ATG3 and incorporated into the
  limiting membrane which harbors the LIRs. The sealed degradation components are
  then further degraded in an acidic environment containing hydrolytic enzymes through
  the fusion of the matured autophagosome with lysosome to form an autolysosome.
