caption: Model of the Subcellular Organization of Avenacin A-1 Biosynthesis in Oat.The
  acyl group of avenacin A-1 originates from the shikimate pathway in the plastid.
  Anthranilate (Anth) (which fluoresces purple under UV illumination) is methylated
  by MT1 (encoded by Sad9) to produce N-methyl anthranilate (NMA) (which fluoresces
  blue) and then glucosylated by UGT74H5 to give N-methyl anthraniloyl-O-glucose (NMA-Glc).
  NMA-Glc is transported into the vacuole by an unknown mechanism, where it serves
  as the acyl donor substrate for SCPL1 (SAD7). The triterpene glycoside is synthesized
  from the cytoplasmic mevalonate (MVA) pathway products, and the early steps are
  catalyzed by β-amyrin synthase (SAD1/AsβAS1) and CYP51H10 (SAD2). These steps are
  likely to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (). Des-acyl
  avenacin A is then formed by a series of as yet uncharacterized oxidation and glycosylation
  steps. The triterpene glycoside is transported into the vacuole, either by a vacuolar
  membrane transporter or possibly through vesicular trafficking from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the vacuole.
