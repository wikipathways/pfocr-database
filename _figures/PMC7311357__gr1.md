  axes along with the other molecular components reported to be involved in SARS-CoV-2
  infection (e.g. TMPRSS2 or FURIN) in human cells. The pathway of SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis
  and replication in cells is also indicated. ❶ SARS-CoV-2 (extracellular or in circulation);
  ❷ binding to ACE2; ❸ TMPRSS2 priming; ❹ clathrin-mediated endocytosis (entry to
  early and acidic late -microtubule bound-endosomes); ❺, ❻ uncoating and viral proteins
  synthesis in free and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) attached ribosomes; ❼ vesicle-mediated
  exocytosis; ❽ MHC class II and MHC class I antigen (Ag) presentation by endocytic
  compartments and proteasome respectively; ❾ immune cells attraction and development
  of immunity or elimination of infected cells. The hemagglutinin-esterase dimmer
  component of SARS-CoV-2 is not shown. → induction, ┤inhibition.
