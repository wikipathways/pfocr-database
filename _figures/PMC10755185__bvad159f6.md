caption: Diagram of the SIRT1 signaling pathway with predicted molecular activity
  overlaid on A, responders, and B, nonresponders after bariatric surgery. A, Diagram
  of the canonical SIRT1 signaling pathway showing 23 genes upregulated (red) and
  1 downregulated (green) and 48 genes that did not reach statistical significance
  (gray) 12 months after bariatric surgery (T2) in responders (R). B, In nonresponders
  (NR), 50 genes were upregulated and 22 genes did not reach statistical significance,
  along with predictions of biological function. Cell proliferation, inflammation,
  neurogenesis, and elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (colored orange)
  are predicted to increase, while apoptosis, oxidative stress, hypertension, Alzheimer
  disease, and renal anemia (colored blue) are predicted to decrease in A, responders,
  and B, the inverse in NR. The inset square shows that SIRT1 is upregulated in T1
  (1) and T2 (2) in R but not in NR (3 and 4). Pathway and molecular activity prediction
  analyses were generated using QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).
