caption: The left-hand side of the diagram illustrates a schematic diagram of vagally-mediated
  gastric reflexes. The right-hand side illustrates a photomicrograph of a rat brainstem
  taken at an intermediate level of the dorsal vagal complex following prior application
  of the neuronal tracer DiI to the nodose ganglion. This neuronal tracer travels
  in both the retrograde and anterograde direction, labeling vagal efferent motoneurons
  within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) as well as vagal afferent fibers
  in the tractus solitarius (TS) and their terminals within the nucleus of the tractus
  solitarius (NTS).Sensory information from the GI tract is relayed centrally via
  the afferent vagus nerve, the cell bodies of which lie in the paired nodose ganglia.
  The afferent signal enters the brainstem via the tractus solitarius (TS), terminating
  with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS), utilizing predominantly glutamate
  as a neurotransmitter. NTS neurons integrate the visceral afferent signals with
  inputs from other brainstem and higher CNS nuclei, transmitting the combined response
  to, among other areas, the adjacent dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), which
  contains the preganglionic parasympathetic motorneurons that provide the principal
  motor output to the stomach.DMV neurons are, a priori, cholinergic, and activate
  nicotinic cholinergic receptors on postganglionic neurons within the target organ
  of interest, in this case, the stomach. Postganglionic neurons form two distinct
  pathways; a cholinergic excitatory pathway that, when activated, increases gastric
  motility and tone via activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors on gastric
  smooth muscle, or a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic pathway that, when activated,
  decreases gastric tone and motility via release of predominantly NO and VIP. Thus,
  inhibition of gastric functions can occur via either withdrawal of tonic cholinergic
  activity, or via activation of the NANC pathway.
