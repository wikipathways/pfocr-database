  fruit. Compounds in boldface letters are detected in flowers and in fruit of different
  developmental stages. Enzymes in boldface letters are those for which the gene expression
  analysis was performed: phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase
  (C4H), 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase
  (CHI), flavanone-3β-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR), flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase
  (F3′H), flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H), flavonol synthase (FLS), leucoanthocyanidin
  reductase (LAR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), and anthocyanidin reductase (ANR).
  Heat map based on the peak areas presents the amounts of proanthocyanidins (PAs)
  in Cistus flowers (S0) and fruits of three developmental stages (S1–S3). The values
  are represented by the intensity of the red color as indicated on the color scale.'
