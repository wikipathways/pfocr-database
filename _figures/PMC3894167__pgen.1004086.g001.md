  which then recruit DNA-PKcs. Note that DNA-PK is absent from yeast. Several proteins,
  including Artemis, the polynucleotide kinase (PNK), and members of the polymerase
  X family, process the DNA ends for subsequent steps –. In the last step, ligase
  IV, associated with its co-factors Xrcc4 and Cernunos/Xlf, joins the ends –. B)

  by Ku70/Ku80, the DNA ends are resected in a reaction favored by the nuclease activity

  complementary microhomologies (two to four nt or more) that can anneal; gap filling
  completes the end-joining. Subsequently, Xrcc1 and ligase III (which can be substituted
  by ligase I) complete A-EJ , , . A-EJ is always associated with deletions at the
  junctions and frequently (but not systematically) involves microhomologies that

  Two-step model for the choice of the DSB repair pathway  ,  . The MRN complex and
  ATM are involved in the early steps of DSB signaling and can activate both C-NHEJ

  DSB repair outcome through C-NHEJ. The nuclease activity of Mre11 and CtIP can initiate
  ssDNA resection. 2) A short ssDNA resection allows A-EJ but not homologous recombination.
  A long ssDNA resection allows A-EJ and HR, but HR requires the presence of homologous
  sequences. A-EJ results in error-prone repair associated with deletions at the repair
  junctions with frequent use of microhomologies distant from the DSB.
