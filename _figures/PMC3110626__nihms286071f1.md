caption: aCGH data for the ninty-three ovarian tumors were analyzed by GenMAPP software.
  Genes are labeled by color according to the frequency of copy number aberration.
  Dark green represents copy number gains in at least 20% of tumors; light green represents
  copy number gains in 15–20% of tumors; dark red represents copy number losses in
  at least 20% of tumors; light red represents copy number losses in 15–20 % of tumors;
  white represents genes with copy number changes in less than 15% of tumors. The
  number next to each gene indicates the exact frequency of copy number aberrations
  of the gene.
