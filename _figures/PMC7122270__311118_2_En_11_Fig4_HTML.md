caption: 'CD95 triggers an unconventional PI3K signaling pathway. Left panel: In the
  presence of cl-CD95L, CD95 triggers MISC formation. This complex is devoid of FADD
  and caspase-8, but, instead, recruits the src kinase c-yes that implements the PI3K
  signaling pathway. CD95 engagement is also capable of NF-κB and MAPK activations
  through a yet unknown mechanism. Right panel: It was reported that procaspase-8
  can be phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinase src upon EGFR stimulation. This posttranslational
  modification not only blocks the catalytic activity of caspase-8 but also promotes
  the recruitment of the p85 subunit of PI3K. We surmise that this caspase-8 phosphorylation
  may favor the non-apoptotic signals induced by CD95'
