caption: The mTOR signaling pathway is upregulated in AA prostate cancer (PCa) specimens.
  MirPath v.3 was used to evaluate the impact of the 10 differentially expressed miRNAs
  (in AA PCa vs. EA PCa) in regulating the biological signaling pathways in AA PCa
  compared to EA PCa. Downregulated (green) and upregulated (red) miRNAs and mRNAs,
  in AA PCa vs. EA PCa, were indicated in mTOR signaling pathway. Three robust reciprocal
  miRNA-mRNA pairings, IGFBP2/miR-34a-5p (up/down), MTOR/miR-99b-5p (up/down) and
  HIF1A/miR-34a-5p (up/down), were highlighted. Unpaired AA-depleted miRNAs (miR-125b-2-3p,
  miR-378a-5p and miR-34a-5p) and AA-enriched miRNAs (miR-130b-3p and miR-96-5p) were
  indicated adjacent to their predicted target genes. The genes highlighted with yellow
  are genes targeted by one AA-depleted/enriched miRNA. The genes highlighted with
  orange are genes targeted by at least two AA-depleted/enriched miRNAs. The genes
  highlighted with light green are genes not targeted by any AA-depleted/enriched
  miRNA.
