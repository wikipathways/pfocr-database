caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)-identified top networks affected by Cd-induced
  oxidation of proteins. The same peptidyl Cys (≥1.5-fold oxidation) selected for
  MetaCore database analysis were used for IPA network analysis (http://www.ingenuity.com/).
  Identified networks are “cellular assembly and organization, cellular function and
  maintenance, and cell cycle”. A group of proteins of the networks shown in a dotted
  circle including cofilin (CFL), F-actin capping protein (CAP1), destrin (DSTN),
  gelsolin (GSN), and protein S100A11 are redox-sensitive actin-binding proteins that
  regulate actin dynamics, polymerization/depolymerization.
