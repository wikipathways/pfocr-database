caption: Positive regulations of JAK/STAT signaling by ARTD family members are depicted
  in green, while negative effects of ARTDs on the signaling pathway are shown in
  red. Solid lines indicate the contribution of ADP-ribosylation to the regulation
  of JAK/STAT signaling. In case the contribution of ADP-ribosylation was not described
  or the protein itself rather than its enzymatic activity is involved in the regulation,
  the interactions are represented by dashed lines.
