caption: The search for pathways that reflect gene expression effects of Semax and
  ACTH(6–9)PGP at 24 h after tMCAO in FC. (a) Venn diagram presents overlapped and
  unique DEG-related annotations in the IS24-f vs. IR24-f and IA24-f vs. IR24-f pairwise
  comparisons. Only pathways that have annotations with DEGs in IA24-f vs. IS24-f
  pairwise comparison are included. The number on the chart segments indicates the
  numbers of annotations. All pathways were grouped on three pathway clusters (PC1,
  PC2 and PC3) (b) The gene network of effects of ACTH(6–9)PGP and Semax peptides
  on transcriptome of FC at 24 h after tMCAO. In the scheme, 13 genes that are DEGs
  in the IA24-f vs. IS24-f are presented. These genes are grouped by three half rings
  of rectangles colored according to their differential expression in comparison groups.
  Each half ring includes the same 32 genes, but the color in the inner half ring
  indicates DEGs in the IA24-f vs. IS24-f, the color in the central half ring indicates
  DEGs in the IS24-f vs. IR24-f, and the colour in the outer half ring indicates the
  DEGs in IA24-f vs. IR24-f. Three pathway clusters (PC1, PC2 and PC3) are grouped
  in ovals. PC1 represents common pathways that lie within the intersection between
  the IA24-f vs. IR24-f and IS24-f vs. IR24-f pathway sets in the Venn diagram (Figure
  4a) and reflects effects of both peptides. PC2 represents unique pathways that lie
  within the pathway sets among the IS24-f vs. IR24-f but not among the IA24-f vs.
  IR24-f pairwise comparisons in the Venn diagram (Figure 4a). PC3 represents unique
  pathways that lie within the pathway sets among the IA24-f vs. IR24-f but not among
  the IS24-f vs. IR24-f pairwise comparisons in the Venn diagram (Figure 4a). The
  lines connecting the genes and pathways indicate association between them. The KEGG
  databases from DAVID v. 2021 were used to annotate all clustered pathways. Only
  DEGs and pathways with Padj < 0.05 were selected as significant. The network was
  constructed using Cytoscape 3.9.2
