caption: Important AM pathways. Glycolysis, TCA cycle, and OXPHOS play major roles
  in energy production with the help of pathways such as the carnitine shuttle (mitochondria),
  which shows enhanced activity during the anti-inflammatory phase. On the contrary,
  Bile Acid Synthesis, and Arachidonic Acid Metabolism are heightened to induce acidic
  conditions to minimize pathogen survival. Pyruvate Metabolism play key roles in
  the immune response of the cell
