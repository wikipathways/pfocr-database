caption: 'Exercise and fasting affect subcellular processes in neurons by brain‐intrinsic
  mechanisms mediated by increased neuronal network activity, and via signals coming
  from the periphery including 3‐β‐hydroxybutyrate (3HB), cathepsin B, and irisin.
  Intellectual challenges involve increased neuronal network activity and consequent
  activation of calcium‐responsive pathways. BDNF expression is up‐regulated by neuronal
  network activity, as well as 3HB, cathepsin B, and irisin, and BDNF is known to
  mediate, at least in part, the enhancement of neuronal plasticity and stress resistance
  by exercise, fasting, and intellectual challenges. Exercise, fasting, and intellectual
  challenges result in the activation of glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses,
  Ca2+ influx, and activation of Ca2+ calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) which,
  in turn, activates the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element‐binding
  protein (CREB). CREB can directly and indirectly modulate mitochondrial biogenesis
  via expression of several genes (i.e. BDNF, PGC‐1α, NRF1, PPARα, and TFAM). Activation
  of glutamate receptors also induces the expression of the mitochondrial protein
  sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) which can protect neurons by deacetylating superoxide dismutase
  2 (SOD2) to increase its enzymatic activity, and thus reduce mitochondrial oxidative
  stress, and by inhibiting cyclophilin D (CycD), a protein involved in the formation
  of membrane permeability transition pores (PTP). 3‐β‐Hydroxybutyrate (3HB) can induce
  BDNF expression in neurons via the Ca2+–CREB pathway, and a pathway involving mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of the transcription factor nuclear
  factor κB (NF‐κB). BDNF is released from neurons and activates the receptor tropomyosin
  receptor kinase B (TrkB), on the same neuron and adjacent neurons, engaging downstream
  intracellular pathways which activate transcription factors that induce the expression
  of genes encoding proteins involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory,
  and neuronal stress resistance. Abbreviations are as follows: Pgc1a, peroxisome
  proliferator‐activated receptor gamma coactivator 1‐alpha; NRF1, nuclear regulatory
  factor 1; PPARα, peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor α; TFAM, mitochondrial
  transcription factor A; GLUT3, glucose transporter 3; MCT2, monocarboxylic acid
  transporter 2; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3 kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; ERK, extracellular
  signal regulated kinase; ETC., electron transport chain; ATP, adenosine‐5′‐triphosphate;
  APE1, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1.'
