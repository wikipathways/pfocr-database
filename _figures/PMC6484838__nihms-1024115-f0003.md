caption: '(A) Left: iGluRs and mGluRs show overlapping expression patterns in all
  major neuronal cell types as well as astrocytes. The exact expression levels and
  receptor subtypes are not known and may vary between cells but also between individual
  synapses. Expression of iGluRs in glia is particularly ill-defined and appears to
  be regional. Glial NMDARs, which might include GluN2C/D and GluN3 subunits most
  prominently, remain contro-versial. Right: iGluRs and mGluRs are present in all
  synaptic compartments; i.e., the presynaptic terminal, the postsynaptic density,
  perisynaptic regions, and astrocytic processes. The precise ultrastructural localization
  determines the timing and concentration of glutamate-induced activation and defines
  both downstream signaling and the potential for functional crosstalk.(B) GluR crosstalk
  in the induction of postsynaptic plasticity. This schematic focuses on the distinct
  pathways employed by NMDARs and mGluR5 in the induction of LTD in hippocampal neurons.
  Both pathways converge on the internalization of AMPARs but may target distinct
  populations.(C) GluR contribution to presynaptic forms of plasticity, as illustrated
  by the dual roles of group II mGluRs and KARs in presynaptic LTD and LTP at hippocampal
  mossy fiber synapses and their convergence on regulation of release probability.
  The factors that determine whether KARs are excitatory or inhibitory and the signaling
  pathway downstream of PKA remain unclear.'
