caption: Binding of thrombopoietin (TPO) to its receptor, MPL, has been shown to activate
  the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby contributing to cell growth and survival. However,
  p85/PI3K does not directly bind the cytoplasmic tail of MPL, and the molecular mediator
  of this signal has remained a mystery. Using a novel approach, whereby almost every
  SRC Homology 2 and phosphotyrosine binding domain in the human genome are spotted
  onto a microarray and probed with fluorescently labeled (TAMRA) phospho-MPL peptides,
  Jung et al. identified an interaction between MPL and Tensin2. They validated this
  interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and functional studies and showed that Tensin2
  represents the missing link between TPO activation of MPL and subsequent activation
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade.
