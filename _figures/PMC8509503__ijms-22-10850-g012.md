caption: The hypothetical model of SiICE1 and SiICE2 involved in the ICE-CBF-COR transcriptional
  regulatory network in response to cold/ freezing tolerance. Solid and dotted arrows
  show the direct and indirect links, respectively. Elliptical objects indicate the
  functional proteins acting as the transcription factors that control the stress-inducible
  gene expression. Cis-acting elements in the promoter region that are involved in
  the stress-responsive transcription are shown in gray boxes. The right panel represents
  the ICE-CBF-COR controlling pathway in response to cold stress.
