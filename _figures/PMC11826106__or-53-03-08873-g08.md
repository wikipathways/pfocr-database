caption: CSRP2 inhibits the necroptosis of glioma cells by activating the JAK-STAT1
  signaling pathway. CSRP2 inhibits the blocking effect of PIAS1 on STAT1 by binding
  to PIAS1 and activated STAT1 can bind to the necroptosis pathway protein RIPK3 to
  inhibit its transcription, and further inhibit necroptosis of glioma cells by inhibiting
  the phosphorylation of downstream MLKL. CSRP2, cysteine- and glycine-rich protein;
  PIAS1, protein inhibitor of activated STAT1
