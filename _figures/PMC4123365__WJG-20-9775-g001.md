caption: 5-fluorouracil is converted to three major active metabolites. (1) fluorodeoxyuridine
  monophosphate (FdUMP); (2) fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP); and (3) fluorouridine
  triphosphate (FUTP). The main mechanism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) activation is conversion
  to fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) either directly by orotate phosphoribosyl
  transferase (OPRT), or indirectly via fluorouridine (FUR) through the sequential
  action of uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase. FUMP is then phosphorylated
  to fluorouridine diphosphate (FUDP), which can be either further phosphorylated
  to the active metabolite fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), or converted to fluorodeoxyuridine
  diphosphate (FdUDP) by ribonucleotide reductase. In turn, FdUDP can either be phosphorylated
  or dephosphorylated to generate the active metabolites FdUTP and FdUMP, respectively.
  An alternative activation pathway involves the thymidine phosphorylase catalyzed
  conversion of 5-FU to 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine (5-FUDR), which is then phosphorylated
  by thymidine kinase to the thymidylate synthase inhibitor, FdUMP. Dihydropyrimidine
  dehydrogenase (DPD)-mediated conversion of 5-FU to dihydrofluorouracil (DHFU) is
  the rate-limiting step of 5-FU catabolism in normal and tumour cells[].

    fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP); (2) fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate
