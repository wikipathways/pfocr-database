caption: Illustration of selected insulin secretion signalling pathways in the pancreatic
  β-cell. Activation of the insulin secretion pathway requires closure of the ATP-sensitive
  potassium channel which in healthy persons is triggered by glucose degradation leading
  to increased intracellular ATP. In persons with KCNJ11 mutations, the Kir6.2- subunit
  of the KATP channel is defective and closure of the channel requires treatment with
  sulfonylurea, which binds to the SUR1-subunit of the channel. GLP-1 receptor agonists
  potentate an already active insulin secretion pathway by binding and activating
  the GLP-1 receptor. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
  GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1; GLUT2, glucose transporter 2; KATP, ATP-sensitive
  potassium channel; SUR-1, sulfonylurea receptor-1

  in the Treatment of KCNJ11 Neonatal Diabetes.
