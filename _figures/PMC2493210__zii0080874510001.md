caption: Schematic diagrams of small intestine mucosa in normal and infected intestines.
  (A) Normal intestinal mucosa, including the epithelial layer with the associated
  brush border, tight junctions, mucosa, and the microbiota. There are small cells
  at the intestinal crypts (Paneth cells) that secrete large amounts of antimicrobial
  peptides (defensins). A large M cell with a closely associated phagocyte is also
  shown. Even during the resting state some of these entrocytes express the cytoplasmic
  microbial pattern recognition receptors (PRR) (i.e., NOD2). (B) Infected intestinal
  mucosa. A typical diseased intestinal epithelium during bacterial insult is shown.
  On the left side (cells labeled A to C) an M cell (cell A) takes up S. enterica
  serovar Typhimurium after the bacterium injects its effectors through the type III
  secretion system (TTSS), leading to the formation of a Salmonella-containing vacuole
  (SCV) and eventual host cell death. Cell death liberates the bacteria, which can
  invade the incoming phagocytes. For a neighboring cell (cell C) the key events of
  the host cell response are shown, which includes LPS activation of a surface pattern
  recognition receptor (TLR4), leading to MyD88-dependent activation of NF-κB and
  basolateral release of IL-8 (CXCL8). At the same time the intracellular pattern
  recognition receptor, NOD2, recognizes a bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) derivative
  and triggers a pathway that culminates in NF-κB activation. The epithelial cells
  also secrete the PMN chemoattractant hepoxilin A3 (HXA3) at the apical surface,
  resulting in an influx of neutrophils into the mucosa and lumen from the underlying
  vascular bed. On the right side (cells D and E) EPEC and V. cholerae infection is
  shown. Cell D loosens the brush border and tight junction due to the bacterial effectors
  secreted by the type III secretion system. In the case of cell E the result is almost
  same, but the outcome is due to a toxin secreted by V. cholerae. FA, fatty acid.
