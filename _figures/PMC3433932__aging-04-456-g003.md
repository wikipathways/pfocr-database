caption: The scheme summarizes the stretch-induced pathway that allows ROS scavenging
  in response to mechanical stimuli. As previously described, stretch–dependent transcriptional
  activation of Sirt1 by EGR1 activates the Sod2 gene by stimulating FOXO binding
  to the Sod2 promoter leading to lowering ROS content to its basal levels []. The
  interaction between EGR1 and SIRT1 prevents EGR1 binding to the Sirt1 promoter triggering
  an autoregularoty loop that turns down SIRT1 expression from the stretch-induced
  to basal levels.
