caption: Receptor for AGE interacts not only with AGEs but also with other ligands
  like LPA, CD11, calgranulins, amyloid beta, HGMB1, and S100 protein. The interaction
  of AGEs with AGER initiates a downstream signalling cascade. The primary mediator
  for the inflammatory pathway is the ultimate induction of NFkB, which causes oxidative
  and inflammatory damage. Hyperglycemia associated oxidative ER stress and reactive
  oxygen species production induce NFkB. This inflammatory and oxidative damage thus
  caused creates a positive feedback loop causing further AGER activation
