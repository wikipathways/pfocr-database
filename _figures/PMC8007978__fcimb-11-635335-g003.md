caption: Mtb metabolism for survival and antibiotic defense in host cells. The Mtb
  survival strategy using host metabolism is shown as a red line. Mtb preferentially
  utilizes host pyruvate for intracellular proliferation. Similarly, lactate produced
  by glycolysis in the host is used for pathogens. Mtb Rv2498c decomposes itaconate
  to produce AcCoA and pyruvate, and leucine decomposes to produce AcCoA and acetoacetate,
  which are used as a nutrient source for Mtb. Lipid bodies in macrophages mainly
  consist of triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol esters (CE) and can be a source
  of nutrients and components for Mtb. Inhibition of Mtb growth is shown as a blue
  line. Itaconate, a macrophage metabolite produced during the inflammatory response
  of Mtb-infected hosts, inhibits bacterial isocitrate lyse (ICL), a key enzyme in
  the glyoxylate cycle of mycobacteria. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria inhibit metabolism
  in antiseptic antibiotic treatment, but antibiotic susceptibility can be improved
  by using metabolic adjuvants to activate central carbon metabolism. Antibiotic resistance
  from altered Mtb metabolism and metabolism-related genes are shown as purple lines.
  Mutations in the glpk coding sequence reduce antibiotic efficacy and contribute
  to a drug-tolerant phenotype. PrpR mutations alter propionyl-CoA metabolism, resulting
  in attenuated antibiotic efficacy and induced multiple drug resistance. The Mtb
  killing effect is enhanced by an enzyme encoded with Ppt hydrolase (pptH) that hydrolyzes
  phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PptT) present in the CoA pathway. However, rv2795c
  loss-of-function mutations in Mtb confer resistance to antibiotics.
