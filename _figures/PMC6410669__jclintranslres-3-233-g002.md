caption: . Schematic representation of the mechanisms involved in normal cell cycle
  control, growth, apoptosis, and cell migration/adhesion that are impaired in cancer
  development. The targets of these pathways are accessed by scorpion and spider venoms
  and toxins (described throughout the text). The pathways were presented in a simplified
  manner and several crosstalk and components were omitted. (A) The control of the
  cell cycle is regulated by the activity of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their
  essential activating coenzymes, the cyclins, and CDKs inhibitors (CDKIs). The phosphoprotein
  pRb (Rb tumor-suppressor protein) regulates the activity of the E2F transcription
  factor. Complexes consisting of E2F and hypophosphorylated pRb repress the transcription
  of the genes required for cell cycle progression. In contrast, phosphorylated pRb
  (by cyclin/CDK complexes) is unable to bind to E2F, resulting in the activation
  of E2F-dependent transcription and advancement into the late G1 and S phases. The
  p53-inducible proteins p21 and p27 (CDKIs) inactivate the cyclin/CDK complexes,
  leading to the dephosphorylation of pRb and cell cycle arrest. (B) Following activation
  by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) or G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K) catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which binds
  and recruits protein kinase B (Akt). Akt regulates cell growth by phosphorylation
  of the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTOR1), which promotes the translation
  of mRNAs to synthesize proteins. As a catalytic antagonist of PI3K, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) dephosphorylates PIP3 to PIP2.
  (C) At the top of the figure, the scheme represents the caspase-independent apoptosis
  mediated by p53. Activated p53 induces apoptosis by transactivating pro-apoptotic
  genes (e.g., BAX, Bak) and by also directly binding to anti-apoptotic mitochondrial
  proteins (e.g., Bcl-2). The p53 protein also activates apoptosis-inducing factor
  (AIF), a factor released from mitochondria to the nucleus, triggering large-scale
  DNA fragmentation and nuclear chromatin condensation. In the lower part of the figure,
  the extrinsic and intrinsic canonical caspase-mediated apoptosis are depicted. In
  the extrinsic pathway, the death receptor-ligand (represented by FAS-Fas ligand
  - FAS + FASL) binds to the Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), constructing
  a complex called the death-inducing signaling complex, which activates initiator
  pro-caspase-8. Caspase-8 activates caspase-3, inducing apoptosis. The intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway is characterized by mitochondrial change in response to various
  stress signals, such as severe genetic damage, hypoxia, and oxidative stress, which
  activate the initiator pro-caspase-9. Mitochondrial pro-apoptotic proteins, BH3-only
  members, activate other pro-apoptotic proteins, such as BAX, and antagonize anti-apoptotic
  proteins (Bcl-2). Subsequently, the mitochondrial outer membrane is disrupted, and
  its permeability increases, resulting in cytochrome-c (Cyt-c) leakage into the cytosol.
  Cyt-c in cytosol forms a complex with Apaf-1, called the apoptosome, which assists
  in auto-activation of initiator pro-caspase-9. Caspase-9 activates caspase-3, leading
  to apoptosis. (D) Ion channels (Na+, K+, Cl−, Ca+) and ion pumps (Na+/K+-ATPase)
  promote cell migration through their ability to cause volume changes and by interacting
  with F-actin. Also, channels and pumps interact with integrins, leading to cell
  adhesion and facilitating migration. See [, , , , ] for a comprehensive review.
