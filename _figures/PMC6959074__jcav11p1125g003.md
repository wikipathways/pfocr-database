caption: Roles of sirtuins may be involved in nicotine/nAChR-mediated signaling pathway.
  Cigarette smoke form carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
  the nicotine-derived nitrosamines 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyrydyl)-1-butanone
  (NNK) and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN). Tumor suppressor mutations caused by these
  carcinogens may initiate carcinogenesis. NNK and NNN also significantly contribute
  to tumor development via activation of nAChRs signaling. SNPs located in a region
  of chromosome region 15q25 that contains nAChR subunits (CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4)
  are significantly associated with lung cancer risk. Sirtuins can exert their capacity
  to respond to environmental changes, and their expression is often altered in cancer.
  However, the tumor suppressor or promoter role of sirtuins in cancer progression
  may depend on their tissue- and cancer-specific expression and examined conditions.
  Several sirtuin inhibitors can suppress lung cancer development and blockade of
  sirtuins may be a potential anticancer strategy. The dotted box indicated the roles
  of sirtuins in other cancer types.
