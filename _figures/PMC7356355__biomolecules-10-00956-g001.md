caption: Intoxification Pathway. The figure shows the intoxification of Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE)-based EGFR-targeted bispecific angiotoxin (eBAT) and
  DTIL2 (Ontak). Regarding eBAT, since the native binding domain has been removed,
  the molecule binds via epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or amino-terminal fragment
  (ATF) to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and urokinase-type plasminogen
  activator receptor (uPAR), respectfully. eBAT is internalized in endocytotic vesicles.
  The toxin contains a natural translocation region (T), translocates the membrane,
  and is released, where it either traffics to the Golgi or continues to lysosomes
  for terminal degradation. In the Golgi, PE that is engineered to express C-terminal
  KDEL encounters KDEL receptors, giving cause to transport PE to the endoplasmic
  reticulum in a retrograde manner. The toxin fragment containing the catalytic domain
  is subsequently transported into the cytosol, where it catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation
  of elongation-2 factor, a vital component of protein synthesis. This is a catastrophic
  ribosomal event that results in cellular apoptotic cell death. DTIL-2 follows a
  very similar mechanism of action but is internalized in acidified vesicles.
