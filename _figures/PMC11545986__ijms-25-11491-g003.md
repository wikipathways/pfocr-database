caption: 'Circadian dysregulation of lipid metabolism and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
  Both circadian rhythm disorders and dysregulated lipid metabolism were proposed
  to result in adverse pregnancy outcomes. In miscarriage, circadian clock genes (Bmal1,
  Clock, Per2, and Rev-erbα) dysregulation could result in abortion and it has also
  been proven that LPA, CPT1a, and PUFA could influence pregnancy outcomes. Moreover,
  studies found that Bmal1 could affect the presence of LPA and FAO and Per2 could
  affect CPT1 expression, suggesting that miscarriages might be the result of lipid
  disorders caused by circadian clock perturbations. In GDM, lower transcript levels
  of Bmal1, Per3, and Cry2 were observed. FFA, ω3-PUFA, and CPT1b could lead to GDM
  via insulin resistance (IR) and the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs). Meanwhile,
  Bmal1 depletion was shown to increase the FFA level. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate
  that circadian rhythm might participate in the development of GDM via regulating
  lipid metabolism. In HDP, the circadian gene Clock was reported to participate in
  the pathogenesis of PE. PPARγ/Nrf2 signaling pathway and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  very long chain (ACADVL) were also linked to the development of PE. Additionally,
  Clock mutant mice could increase lipid absorption and persistent hypertriglyceridemia,
  suggesting that HDP could be the result of lipid disorders caused by circadian disruption.
  Further studies should investigate whether adverse pregnancy outcomes are caused
  by circadian dysregulation of lipid metabolism and should elucidate the potential
  mechanisms. Solid line: confirmed; dashed line: partial confirmation. Figures were
  created with Figdraw'
