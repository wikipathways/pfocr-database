caption: Signaling pathways involved in HCV-induced HCC. The process of HCV-induced
  HCC involves in several signaling pathways, including Wnt signaling pathway, Ras/MAPK
  signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, JAK-STAT pathway, and PI3K-AKT pathway.
  For Wnt signaling pathway, HCV infection downregulates APC and Axin2 expression
  via hypermethylation, which activates LEF/TCF-dependent downstream genes, such as
  c-Myc, CCND1, and Cyclin and thus promotes cell proliferation and differentiation.
  The HCV-mediated activation of JAK-STAT pathway by decreasing SOCS1 and increasing
  IGF, STAT1 to forms a negative feedback and inhibits cell apoptosis. The downregulation
  of DUSP4, RASAL1, and RasGRF2 by HCV infection also stimulates Ras/MAPK signaling
  pathway for cell growth. IGF also activates PI3K-AKT pathway by reducing RXRA expression.
  p53 signaling pathway is also modulated by HCV infection through downregulation
  of P14, Reprimo and CASP8, preventing from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The
  crosstalk between different signaling pathways happens and cooperates for cell growth
  and tumorigenesis. The proteins with normal expression are black; the downregulated
  proteins, resulted from these gene promoters’ DNA methylation, are red and upregulated
  proteins for gene promoters’ DNA demethylation are green. APC, adenomatous polyposis
  coli; DUSP1, dual‐specificity phosphatase 1; JAK/STAT, Janus kinase-signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; CCND1, cyclin D1;
  SOCS1, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; RASAL1, Ras protein activator like 1;
  RasGRF2, Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 2; CASP8, caspase
  8; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
