caption: Lipid metabolites, including fatty acids (FA), activate cell surface G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCR) such as Gpr40, Gpr120 and Gpr119, or enter the β cell via transporters
  (CD36). Once inside the cell FA are activated by fatty acid-CoA ligase (ACSL) to
  generate acyl-CoA. Acyl-CoA is a substrate for mitochondrial β-oxidation, however
  in the presence of high glucose concentrations malonyl-CoA inhibits the enzyme carnitine
  palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) blunting β-oxidation and shunting acyl-CoA towards
  the glycerolipid/free fatty acid (GL/FFA) cycle, which generates triglycerides (TG)
  and mono- (MAG) and di-acyglycerols (DAG), or the sphingolipid synthesis pathway,
  which generates ceramides and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) among other metabolites.
  Together these metabolites regulate insulin secretion, however, their role in β-cell
  proliferation has yet to be demonstrated.
