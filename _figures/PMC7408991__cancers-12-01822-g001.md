caption: 'Metabolic fates of glucose metabolism. Under aerobic conditions, glucose
  is converted to pyruvate and then moved to the mitochondria, where it undergoes
  oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. The mitochondria are the main source
  of ROS, which cause oxidative damage to biomolecules. O2•− and its product H2O2
  can be neutralized by antioxidant molecules (e.g., GSH and coenzyme Q) and antioxidant
  enzymes (e.g., SOD and catalase). Under anaerobic conditions (including in cancer
  cells), pyruvate is used for lactate fermentation to produce ATP. Glucose 6-phosphate
  is bypassed to the pentose phosphate pathway to generate NADPH. Oxidative stress
  and metabolic inhibitors are involved in metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells.
  Abbreviations: 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; 3-BP, 3-bromopyruvate; BZL101, Bezielle; Mito-Q,
  mitoquinone mesylate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
