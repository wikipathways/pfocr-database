caption: 'Serine and the folate cycle contribute additional NADPH during MOV: Serine
  may be generated via the serine synthesis pathway or brought into the cell by the
  sodium‐coupled neutral amino acids transporter (Slc38a1). Serine can then participate
  in the generation of NADPH though the folate cycle. The mitochondrial compartment
  of the folate cycle is upregulated during MOV as highlighted by log twofold change
  (blue: upregulated and black: not differentially expressed) of genes involved in
  these reactions. N = 2/group (pooled samples). *denotes statistical significance
  (adjusted p value <0.05) compared to sham (control)'
