caption: SK1/S1P signalling pathway. Tumour necrosis factor alfa, growth factors and
  cytokines activate receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, toll
  like receptors, which induce phosphorylation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1, often
  through ERK1/2 and PKC), its translocation to plasma membrane and generation of
  sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) from sphingosine (reviewed in []). S1P can then be
  exported outside of the cell where it acts in a paracrine or autocrine manner and
  activates 5 specific S1P receptors (S1P1-5). Upon coupling with S1P, these receptors
  can activate downstream signalling pathways leading to cell proliferation, migration
  and gene expression. PKC - protein kinase C; (reviewed in [] and []).
