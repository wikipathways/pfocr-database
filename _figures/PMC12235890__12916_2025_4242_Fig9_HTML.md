caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the mechanism by which vagus nerve stimulation
  (VNS) suppresses microglial pyroptosis after ischemic stroke by modulating osteopontin
  (OPN) expression and targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. VNS treatment induced
  upregulation of osteopontin (OPN) expression following ischemic stroke. OPN may
  bind to apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), thereby
  inhibiting ASC oligomerization and subsequent assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  This leads to reduced caspase-1 activation, suppressing the cleavage of pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 into their mature pro-inflammatory forms (IL-1β and IL-18), as well
  as inhibiting gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. As a result, microglial pyroptosis
  is attenuated, contributing to improved neurological outcomes after ischemic brain
  injury
