caption: 'Schematic representation of the relevant signaling pathway potentially being
  involved in the pathogenesis of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and/or chronic kidney
  disease (CKD). Several modulator molecules linked to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/mTORC1 signaling
  pathway are demonstrated. Examples of compound metformin, as well as hypoxia and/or
  starvation, known to act on the AMPK/mTOR and/or mitophagy signaling, are also shown.
  Arrowhead indicates stimulation, whereas hammerhead shows inhibition. Note that
  several important activities, such as cytokine-induction and/or inflammatory reactions,
  have been omitted for clarity. Abbreviation: mTOR, mammalian/mechanistic target
  of rapamycin; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3 kinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species'
