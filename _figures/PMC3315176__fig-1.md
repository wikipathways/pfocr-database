caption: General organization of mitochondrial electron transfer chain and the formation
  of O2 species are modulated by NO. Electrons from reduced metabolites from the intermediary
  metabolism and tricarboxylic cycle enter the respiratory chain as NADH (to NADH
  dehydrogenase at complex I) or from succinate (to succinate dehydrogenase at complex
  II) and lead to a two-step reduction of reduced ubiquinol (to semiubiquinone, and
  ubiquinone). This sequential pathway finally reduces O2 to water and, depending
  on electron entrance, extrudes two or three protons that creates an inner membrane
  potential and re-enter by ATP synthase with dissipation of energy and formation
  of ATP. From a low to high concentration, NO progressively inhibits cytochrome oxidase,
  complex II-III, and complex I. Myx, myxothiazole; AA, antimycin A; FeS, Fe sulfur
  complex; Cyt, cytochrome; SUCC, succinate; FUM, fumarate.
