caption: Molecular pathways activated by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors
  and affected by MPN-associated mutations. Most cytokine and growth factor receptors
  can activate the HIF-1α, NF-κB, and/or one or more of the different JAK/STAT pathways,
  either directly or indirectly. Among the JAK kinases, myeloid cells express essentially
  JAK2 and to a lesser degree JAK1 and TYK2 (not represented). JAK2 activates STAT5
  and STAT3. JAK1 activates mainly STAT1 and to a lesser degree STAT3. The different
  STAT transcription factors form homodimers as well as heterodimers, which allows
  for a differential regulation of the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In MPN
  clonal cells, the JAK2-coupled receptors of EPO, TPO, and G-CSF may form complexes
  with and activate wild type JAK2 only, V617F-mutated JAK2 only, or wild type and
  V617F-mutated JAK2, which likely result in different levels of activation of the
  JAK2/STAT pathways concerned. Moreover, EPO, TPO, and G-CSF activate other molecular
  pathways besides the JAK/STAT pathways, such as the antiapoptosis, prosurvival PI3K/AKT
  pathway and the proproliferation RAS/MAPK pathway. Of note, activation of HIF-1α
  leads to an increased production of inflammatory cytokines in all cell types, but
  HIF-1α induces EPO expression only in the rare EPO-producing cell types (renal cells,
  neuronal cells, and certain tumors). LNK loss-of-function mutants result in enhanced
  activation of JAK2/STAT5. The CBL mutants detected in MPNs also enhance JAK/STAT
  signaling. Blue arrows represent JAK/STAT pathways, and red arrows represent HIF
  pathways.
