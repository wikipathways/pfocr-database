caption: A schematic illustration of thermal stress regulation of satellite cell function
  and fate through Wnt planar cell polarity pathway. Heat stress stimulates the expression
  of wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family (Wnt) protein
  ligands. Interaction between Wnt ligand and cell surface receptor Frizzled-7 (Fzd7)
  stimulates the activation of ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and ras-related
  C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) by binding guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP)
  to RhoA and Rac1. Activated RhoA and Rac1 will activate its downstream effector
  rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and c-Jun, respectively, by phosphorylation
  (P). Activated ROCK not only organizes cytoskeleton protein for cell migration but
  also regulates the expression of specific genes that are associated with satellite
  cell proliferation, myogenesis, and adipogenesis. Activated c-Jun regulates satellite
  cell proliferation by stimulating the expression of genes promoting cell cycle progression
  through the G1 phase.
