caption: Impact of AMD administration on the Gastrointestinal (GIT) microbiota after
  oral and parenteral administration. (A) After oral AMD administration, the distal
  intestinal microbiota (comprising zoonotic pathogens and the commensal flora) is
  exposed to the unabsorbed drug fraction in the proximal segment of the digestive
  tract (1-F%, where F = bioavailability). Potentially, this can lead to local selective
  pressure, thereby increasing the density of the resistant bacteria and resistance
  genes. This load of enriched resistant bacteria and resistance genes is then released
  into the environment via fecal excretion. These organisms and genes can reach humans
  by several pathways and thereby ultimately gain access to the human GIT microbiota.
  The principal pathway is via the food chain. (B) After systemic AMD administration
  most drugs used in veterinary medicine are eliminated, to varying degrees but often
  extensively, in the digestive tract, either by biliary secretion or by intestinal
  clearance as a consequence of eﬄux pumps in the GIT wall. Intestinal drug concentrations
  capable of selecting for resistant organisms, with consequential detrimental effects,
  may occur, as for the oral administration route. In addition, the impact of AMDs
  on the animal GIT microbiota is not limited to the easily cultivable aerobic fraction,
  which accounts for only 1–2% of the total microbiota (typically Escherichia coli
  and E. faeciens which are considered as sentinel bacteria). AMDs can also negatively
  impact on the much larger anaerobic population [reviewed by ()].
