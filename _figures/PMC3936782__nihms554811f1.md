caption: 'Canonical signal transduction cascades and mood stabilizer targets in bipolar
  disorder. On the left side of the figure, monoaminergic (serotonin, norepinephrine,
  and dopamine) neurotransmitter receptors activates the intracellular phosphoinositide
  second messenger/signal transduction cascade. Phospholipases enzymatically degrade
  phosphoinositides to inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Lithium
  (and potentially mood-stabilizing antiepileptic drugs) noncompetitively inhibits
  inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), which decreases myoinositol uptake and phosphoinositide
  production in the brain and/or peripheral tissues. Mood stabilizers also inhibit
  multiple other overactive nodes in intracellular pathways: protein kinase C (PKC),
  myristolated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), and extracellular regulated
  protein kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which coalesces to
  decrease cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and CRE-mediated
  gene transcription. On the right side of the figure, overactivation of the canonical
  Wnt/Fz/Dvl/GSK-3β signaling pathway in BD commences when Wnt glycoprotein extracellularly
  binds to its cognate Frizzled (Fz) receptor. Intracellular Fz activation stimulates
  Disheveled and GSK-3β phosphorylation, which phosphorylates β-catenin and promotes
  the formation of a lysosomal destruction complex with the other proteins (axin/APC/GSK-3β/β-catenin).
  Lithium is a potent GSK-3β inhibitor. Therefore, lithium reduces GSK-3β phosphorylation,
  decreases β-catenin phosphorylation, and dissociates the destruction complex, which
  stabilizes β-catenin for nuclear translocation and increases the transcription of
  β-catenin target genes. Li, lithium; AED, antiepileptic mood stabilizer medication;
