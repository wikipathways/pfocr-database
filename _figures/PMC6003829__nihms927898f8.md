caption: 'Event in blue-box denotes our previously published finding. Events in yellow-box
  denote our findings of this study. Unboxed events denote predicted consequences
  of our results. Bold black arrows connect proposed mechanistic pathway for the observed
  signaling outcomes based on our findings of this study. Hatched grey arrows indicate
  putative consequences of our findings on other related pathways, not tested in this
  study, but predicted from published results in other systems. Model: Loss of WASp
  disrupts chromatin-occupancy of CDK9 and TOP1. CDK9-deficiency contributes to impaired
  S2P-modification, the latter further compromising TOP1 recruitment to RNAP2. S2P-deficient
  RNAP2 can still generate short, unprocessed mRNA transcripts, which could fuel R-loop
  formation. TOP1 defect will also contribute to R-loop formation through its effects
  both on DNA-supercoiling and splicing factors.- R-loops are known to incite DNA-damage,
  which via ATM-mediated spliceosome displacement, could further fuel R-loop formation.
  R-loop-mediated DDR-signaling activates S2P-phosphatases, e.g., protein phosphatase-1,
  which will dephosphorylate S2P contained within the elongation-complex in the gene-body.
  Together, a feed-forward causative loop of either R-loops⇒elongation-defect⇒R-loops
  (R-loop model) or elongation-defect⇒R-loops⇒elongation-defect (S2P model) will develop
  in WASp-deficient Th1-cells, resulting in R-loop-mediated DSBs. DSBs will elicit
  chronic-DDR, the latter known to perturb the global transcription programs of the
  affected cell, including provoking pro-inflammation,, which we propose contributes
  to immunodeficiency and autoimmunity/autoinflammation in both cell-autonomous and
  non-cell autonomous fashion.'
