caption: 'The visual pigment cycle reactions in vertebrate and invertebrate photoreceptors:
  (A) Pathways for visual pigment regeneration in the vertebrate retina, including
  both the classical and non-classical pathways. A cone photoreceptor (dark blue)
  and its'' interactions with the muller glial cells (magenta) and Retinal pigment
  epithelium (RPE, light blue). Red arrows with red text annotation indicate enzyme
  mediated reactions and their respective enzymes. The classical pathway occurs via
  the RPE, all-trans-retinol is taken up by IRBP into the RPE, where LRAT, RPE65,
  and 11-cis-RDH mediates its conversion to 11-cis-retinal which is then taken up
  by the photoreceptor via IRBP again, which reassociated with the apo-opsin. The
  intrinsic light mediated pathway combining all-trans-RAL with phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) to form all-trans-N-retinyl-PE (N-retPE), which is then converted to 11-cis-retinal
  via a blue photon. Light mediated pigment regeneration can occur both in M端ller
  cells and RPE, whereby all-trans retinal is converted to 11-cis retinal mediated
  by RGR opsin and the absorption of a photon. Stores of 11-cis-retinoids as well
  as all-trans-RE are present in both the RPE and M端ller cells. (B) Summary of the
  visual pigment cycle in invertebrates. The invertebrate visual pigment, 3-OH 11-cis
  retinal is a bistable pigment, and remains associated to the opsin, upon absorption
  of a second photon, it can convert back from 3-OH all-trans retinal to 3-OH 11-cis
  retinal. An external pathway is only required in conditions in which the animal
  is calorie restricted. This pathway is mediated by the retinal pigment cells that
  surround the rhabdomeres and involves the Photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase (PDH)
  and retinol dehydrogenase B (RDHB) enzymes.'
