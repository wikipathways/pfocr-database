caption: The impact of the ER stress response on the development of GVHD. The modulation
  of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell function in the development of GVHD
  is significantly influenced by ER stress response. XBP-1 can interfere with the
  generation of antimicrobial peptides, change the microbiome composition, and trigger
  the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). The IRE-1α/XBP-1 signaling
  pathway is crucial for both the development and antigen-presenting ability of dendritic
  cells (DCs). Additionally, CHOP plays a role in IL-23 production by DCs, which is
  important for Th17 differentiation in the development of GVHD. The activation of
  IRE-1 and ATF6 is related to the polarization and pro-inflammatory activity of macrophages.
  IRE-1 activation can induce T cell exhaustion and repress mitochondrial respiration,
  while PERK activation can reduce T-bet expression and subsequently decrease Th1
  activation. However, mild activation of PERK can induce protective mitophagy and
  enhance T cell function. The induction of RIDD through XBP-1 inhibition resulted
  in a decrease of B cell pathogenicity. Activation of myofibroblast, which leads
  to accelerated fibrosis, is associated with the activation of IRE-1 and ATF6. Taken
  together, targeting the ER stress response may be an effective approach for controlling
  GVHD and malignant relapse.
