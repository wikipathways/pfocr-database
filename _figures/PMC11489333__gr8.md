caption: Schematic of positive feedback for self-driving of NK-92-αFR-CAR-CXCR3A cells
  based on IFN-γ and TNF-α synergistically induced high CXCL10 expression. In the
  antitumor process, IFN-γ and TNF-α secreted by NK-92-αFR-CAR-CXCR3A cells synergistically
  induced high expression of CXCL10 in ovarian cancer cells through JAK-STAT1 and
  NF-κB signaling pathways, respectively. Under the action of CXCL10, NK-92-αFR-CAR-CXCR3A
  cells continue to chemotactically migrate into tumor tissues, which can not only
  make ovarian cancer cells secrete more CXCL10, but also further enhance the antitumor
  effects
