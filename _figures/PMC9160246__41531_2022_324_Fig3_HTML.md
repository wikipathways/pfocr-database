caption: 'Interaction among various cell groups inside the cortex causes inflammation
  is depicted here. Neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells are vulnerable
  to α-synuclein aggregation (i.e., through phagocytic cells, endocytic pathway, Toll-like
  receptor (TLR) activation, etc.), which could indeed hinder their homeostatic operations
  (diminished secretion of neurotrophic factors (NFs), deficient glutamate uptake,
  etc.) as well as production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (MHCI in
  microglial cells, adhesion molecules in the endothelium, etc.). Peripheral immune
  cells (such as CD4+ T cells) are also drawn into the cerebral tissue. The presence
  of these immunoregulatory factors, as well as the lack of effective relieving processes,
  adds to the inflammation milieu. VCAM: Vascular Cell Adhesion Protein, ICAM1: Intercellular
  Adhesion Molecule 1, NOS: Nitric oxide species, ROS: Reactive Oxygen Species, SASP:
  Senescence-associated secretory phenotype.'
