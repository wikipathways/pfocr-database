caption: Inhibitory pathways in innate cells utilizing ITIM or “inhibitory” ITAM signaling
  pathways. Shown to the left are classical inhibitory receptors that contain ITIM
  binding sequences within their cytoplasmic tails. Like activating receptors, the
  inhibitory receptors can be both immunoglobulin superfamily proteins or C-type lectin
  receptors. For a more exhaustive list of inhibitory receptors in innate cells, see
  Munitz (). Inhibitory receptors are often engaged simultaneously with activating
  receptors, though they recognize distinct sets of ligands, during innate immune
  recognition of complex pathogens such as bacteria and yeast. The ITIM domains on
  these proteins are then phosphorylated by SFKs, which results in the recruitment
  of tyrosine or lipid phosphatase (Shp1/2 or Ship, respectively), which in turn dampen
  signaling by dephosphorylation of a number of substrates (the ITAMs themselves or
  downstream substrates in the MAPK, Ca2+, or Rho/WASP pathways). Ship works directly
  to convert PIP3 back to PIP2 and hence opposes PI3-kinase function (). Not shown
  are inhibitory DOK proteins, which are cytoplasmic adapter proteins that also recruit
  RasGAP and Ship to down-regulate signaling responses (see ). This inhibitory receptor
  pathway also functions to down-modulate other signaling responses besides just ITAM/immunoreceptor
  pathways, in particular G-protein-coupled pathways and TLR responses (; ). To the
  right are shown examples of inhibitory receptors that function through “inhibitory”
  ITAM signaling. This pathway is believed to be engaged following low avidity interactions
  of these receptors with various ligands, which results in only weak phosphorylation
  of associated ITAM adapters (shown as the ∼P on FcRγ and DAP12). The partial phosphorylation
  of the ITAMs leads to Shp-1/2 recruitment instead of Syk recruitment, hence engaging
  an inhibitory response analogous to an ITIM pathway (see ; ). This more novel mechanism
  of signal inhibition has mainly been revealed by studies of innate cells lacking
  DAP12 or FcRγ. Like the classical ITIM pathway, the low avidity inhibitory ITAM
  pathway also regulates TLR responses (). However, when these receptors are engaged
  by more high avidity ligands, they can induce activating signaling responses.
