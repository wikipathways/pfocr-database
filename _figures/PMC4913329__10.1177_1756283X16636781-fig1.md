caption: Schematic illustration showing the TGF-β1-associated Smad pathway in normal
  (a) and inflamed (b) intestine. Physiologically active TGF-β1 binds to the TGF-β
  receptor subunit II (RII) and promotes phosphorylation (p) and activation of TGF-β
  receptor subunit I (RI), thus leading to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. Once
  phosphorylated, Smad2 and Smad3 interact with Smad4 and the complex translocates
  to the nucleus, where it controls the transcriptional activity of multiple genes,
  including those encoding for inflammatory molecules (a). In the gut of patients
  with inflammatory bowel diseases (b) there is a defective TGF-β1-associated Smad
  pathway, because cells express elevated levels of Smad7, an intracellular protein
  whose expression is regulated by molecules that enhance its acetylation status (i.e.
  p300). Smad7 binds to TGF-βRI and prevents phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, with
  the downstream effect of suppressing TGF-β1-driven counter-regulatory properties,
  thus amplifying inflammatory gene expression.TGF, transforming growth factor.
