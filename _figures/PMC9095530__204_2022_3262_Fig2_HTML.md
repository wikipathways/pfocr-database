caption: Doxorubicin-induced inflammatory response and resultant. The binding of tumor
  necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) to TNFR1 facilitates the assembly of cytoplasmic complex
  II, consisting of the receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIPK1), caspase-8 (Casp-8)
  and complex Fas-associated via death domain (FADD). This complex triggers the autophosphorylation
  and oligomerization of receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinases 1/3
  (RIPK1 and RIPK3) and the simultaneous inhibition of Casp-8, which initiates necroptosis
  via the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL). Additionally,
  Dox impairs nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κβ) activity via the overexpression of
  interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6, and by disrupting the IkappaB (IκB)-kinase
  (IKK) complex, which is composed of the kinases IKKα and IKKβ and the adaptor protein
  NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator). Dox inhibition of the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) pathway impedes the transcription
  of anti-apoptotic genes and thus, worsens the cardiac outcome
