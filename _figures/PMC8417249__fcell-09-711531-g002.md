caption: 'Mechanosensing in the control of cell fate decisions: the YAP/TAZ pathway
  acting upstream of Notch signaling in cell-autonomous vs. non–cell-autonomous mechanisms.
  (A,A’) Schematic representation of a chick fetal muscle. Muscle progenitors are
  depicted in orange and muscle fibers in blue. (A’) Magnification of the framed region
  in (A). Upon muscle contraction, YAP translocates to the nucleus, binds to TEAD,
  and activates the transcription of Jag2. Jagged2 ligand activates Notch receptor
  in the neighboring cell and maintains the muscle progenitor in a non–cell-autonomous
  manner (). (B,B’) Schematic representation of a mammalian epidermis. Epidermal progenitors
  are depicted in orange and cells committing to the epidermal fate in blue. Differentiated
  epidermal cells are depicted in gray. (B’) Magnification of the framed region in
  (B). YAP/TAZ–TEAD drive the expression of Dll1 and Dll3 that cis inhibit Notch signaling
  in basal progenitors, preventing epidermal differentiation in a cell-autonomous
  manner ().'
