caption: The canonical β2-adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling pathway is illustrated
  here. In target tissues, activated sympathetic nerves release the neurotransmitter,
  norepinephrine (NE) from “boutons en passage”. NE and epinephrine from the circulation
  are the natural ligands (L) for the β2-AR. β2-ARs couple with stimulatory Gαs subunit
  to modulate the activity of adenylate cyclase (AC). Receptor activation causes dissociation
  of Gαs from the Gβγ subunit complex of the Gs protein, which results in AC-mediated
  production of cAMP from ATP. Next, cAMP activates either protein kinase A-I (PKA-I)
  or -II. PKA activation leads to the activation of transcription factors such as
  cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein to regulate gene transcription.
