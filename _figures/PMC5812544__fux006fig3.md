caption: (p)ppGpp-hipA mediated persister pathway. In response to particular stresses,
  SpoT and RelA are activated to synthesise the nucleotide alarmone (p)ppGpp, The
  increased (p)ppGpp levels lead to the accumulation of inoganic polyphosphate (PolyP)
  through inhibition of exopolyphosphatase (PPX), that the cellular enzyme to degrades
  PolyP. The accumulated PolyP combines with Lon protease preferentially to cleave
  the antitoxin HipB, resulting in an excess of toxin HipA. In return, free active
  toxin HipA inactivates GltX by phosphorylation of its ATP-binding site Ser239, with
  the consequence of uncharged tRNA with glutamate (tRNAGlu) accumulation in the cell.
  Uncharged tRNAGlu loads at empty ribosomal sites and triggers the activation of
  RelA to more (p)ppGpp synthesis, promoting cells entry into dormant state. Note
  that SpoT and RelA are bifunctional synthetase-hydrolase enzyme, if the stresses
  have been removed, they can hydrolase (p)ppGpp and bring cells to normal growth
  (Dalebroux and Swanson ). The red box labelled with ‘?’ indicates that the link
  between stringent response-associated genes (including ppGpp, Lon, PolyP) and TAs
  has been exploring in some TAs, such as relBE, mazEF and yefM-yeoB. It has been
  proved that the activation of toxin MazF and YoeB is dependent on the Lon-mediated
  degradation of their cognates, antitoxins, but not on the accumulation of PolyP
  and ppGpp (Christensen et al. , ; Ramisetty et al. ).
