caption: Non-canonical and canonical Wnt pathways. In the non-canonical Wnt/PCP and
  Wnt/Ca2+pathway (A), the interaction of Wnt/Fzd/ROR and RYK promotes the activation
  of small GTPases like Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, which activate JNK and ROCK, inducing
  cell polarity and cytoskeletal reorganization through the expression of the target
  gene induced by the AP-1 transcriptional factor (PCP pathway). The interaction of
  Wnt/Fzd with G proteins induces the activation of PLC, promoting the cleavage of
  PIP2 to DAG and PIP3, causing the activation of PKC and calcium release by IP3 from
  the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium activates CAMK, with the subsequent transactivation
  of NFAT and the regulation of EMT, cell invasion, and migration (Wnt/Ca2+pathway).
  With respect to the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway (B), in the absence of Wnt ligands,
  the pathway is turned off. Cytosolic β-Catenin is phosphorylated by a Destruction
  Complex formed by APC, Axin, CKI, and GSK3β, which lead to its proteasomal degradation.
  In the nucleus, the transcriptional factors TCF/LEF bind the transcriptional repressors
  Groucho/HDAC. On the other hand, when activated, Wnt binds Fzd/ Lrp5/6, activating
  Dvl, which recruits Axin, favoring the dissociation and inactivation of the Destruction
  Complex and an ensuing cytoplasmic accumulation (and a nuclear accumulation at latter
  times) of β-catenin; in the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with TCF/LEF and transcriptional
  coactivators like Bcl-9, CBP, and p300 to transcribe its target genes, regulating
  cell survival, proliferation, EMT transition, differentiation, cell cycle arrest,
  and apoptosis. Continue arrows (↓) indicate activation; arrows with (⊥) indicate
  inhibition.
