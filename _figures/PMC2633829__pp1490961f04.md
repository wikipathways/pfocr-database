caption: Parallel display of transcripts and metabolites for starch-Suc metabolism,
  glycolysis, the TCA cycle, GABA shunt, mitochondrial respiratory chain, and amino
  acid metabolism. Significant fold changes in transcripts and metabolites were log
  transformed and displayed on a custom pathway picture using the MapMan tool. Where
  possible, metabolite changes are indicated in the circles next to the corresponding
  metabolite name (gray boxes) and correspond to a comparison of 6 and 24 HAI. Enzymatic
  conversions between metabolites are indicated by arrows and enzyme names. Changes
  in transcripts encoding these enzymes are indicated in the boxes next to the enzyme
  names and correspond to the 3- versus 12-HAI comparison. In most cases, the enzymes
  involved are encoded by a small gene family. However, in some cases, individual
  enzymes are not distinguished and a more general classification of the contributing
  transcripts is indicated in italics (e.g. starch degradation). This is also the
  case for components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (CI–CV), where
  transcript levels for different nucleus-encoded subunits are presented. For both
  metabolites and transcripts, changes are represented by shading, where the color
  saturates at a log2 false color (FC) value of 4 (i.e. a 16-fold change).
