caption: Pathway analysis revealed that networks of genes dysregulated by the in utero
  e-cig exposure were associated with the role of NFAT in regulation of immune responses
  in PND5 female offspring. At PND5, female offspring exposed in utero to e-cig aerosol
  exhibited dysregulation of genes associated with Wnt signaling, regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) pathway, PCP pathway, the role of NFAT in regulation of the immune
  response, and TGF-B signaling, when compared to the respective in utero air control
  group. Genes in red show up-regulation, while genes in green show down-regulation
