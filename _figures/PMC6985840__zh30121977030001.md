caption: The pathways of tryptophan metabolism. In the serotonergic synaptic varicosity,
  tryptophan (Trp) enters the cell through an amino acid transporter, where it is
  primarily converted to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) through the actions of the rate-limiting
  tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2). It is then converted to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine,
  5-HT) by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). Alternatively, tryptophan can
  enter the kynurenine (Kyn) pathway through metabolism by the ubiquitous indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase
  enzyme (IDO) or the hepatic tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase enzyme (not depicted). The
  vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) transports monoamines, including 5-HT,
  from the cellular cytosol into vesicles. Upon receiving a stimulus, 5-HT vesicles
  fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing 5-HT into the synaptic cleft, where it
  can activate 5-HT receptors on the target cell. 5-HT is then inactivated by reverse
  transport back into the presynaptic neuron through the actions of the serotonin
  reuptake transporter (SERT). There, it can either be recycled into vesicles or converted
  into the metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) by the actions of monoamine
  oxidase (MAO).
