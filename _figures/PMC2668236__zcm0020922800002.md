caption: The major pathway and inflammatory mediators of sepsis and its related conditions.
  LPS and other microbial components (PAMPs) trigger PRRs, such as TLR4. However,
  TLR4 may also be triggered in the absence of infection, for instance by the enzymatic
  release of ECM proteins (alarmins). PAMPs and alarmins belong to the larger group
  of DAMPs. Systemic TLR4 triggering leads to overproduction of inflammatory mediators,
  which contribute to the massive activation and recruitment of different cell types,
  as well as to the activation of the coagulation pathways. Neutrophils release large
  amounts of enzymes (e.g., MMPs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the excessive
  activation of coagulation factors leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation
  (DIC). This, together with NO-mediated cardiovascular anomalies, will inevitably
  cause tissue damage and subsequent organ failure and death.
