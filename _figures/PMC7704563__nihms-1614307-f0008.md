caption: Steatosis is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Lipotoxicity
  and inflammation induce hepatic expression of CXCL1 and IL-8, which promotes NASH
  development. Fatty liver induced by 3-month HFD feeding has prominent fat accumulation
  with relatively low levels of ROS and oxidative stress. Under this condition, activation
  of p38α is mild, which preferentially activates the signaling pathways that lead
  to FA β-oxidation via PPARα phosphorylation than those activating hepatocyte death.
  NASH induced by HFD+Cxcl1 challenge has significant hepatic neutrophil infiltration
  and subsequent ROS production, which causes a greater degree of oxidative stress
  and p38 phosphorylation than HFD feeding alone via upstream kinases (e.g., ASK1)
  as reported by our previous work (illustrated in the red square).() This condition
  further stimulates the signaling pathway leading to hepatocyte apoptosis via BCL2
  phosphorylation, CASP3 cleavage, and CHOP upregulation. Therefore, in simple steatosis
  induced by HFD, p38α plays an adaptive role to protect against fat accumulation,
  whereas in NASH induced by HFD+Cxcl1, robust p38α activation promotes hepatocyte
  death and liver inflammation, thereby exacerbating NASH.
