caption: Schematic diagram. Exogenous HB-EGF actives NF-κB pathway by transferring
  p65 to the nucleus in airway epithelial cells. The activation of NF-κB signaling
  increases IL-8 production. And then, a large amount of IL-8 is secreted to the extracellular
  matrix. Under the excessive stimulation of IL-8, the proliferation and migration
  of lung fibroblasts are activated
