caption: Exosomal miRNA biogenesis, sorting, trafficking, and biological function.
  Most miRNAs are encoded by their own genes. RNA polymerase II transcribes these
  genes, producing pri-miRNA. Pri-miRNA is processed in the nucleus by Drasha, generating
  pre-miRNA. Pre-miRNA is then transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5. It is further
  processed in the cytoplasm by Dicer, generating mature miRNA. Four sorting pathways
  exist for miRNA entry into the exosome, namely, the sphingomyelinase 2-dependent
  pathway, hnRNP-dependent pathway, miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) associated
  pathway, and sequence-dependent pathway involving the 3′-end of miRNA. Exosomal
  miRNA plays a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation upon uptake by neighboring
  or distant cell. It enters the target cell and combines with the target mRNA molecule
  based on partial sequence complementarity. miRNAs inhibit protein synthesis by forming
  miRISC, a complex with specific proteins. AGO2 and GW182 are the core components
  of miRISC.
