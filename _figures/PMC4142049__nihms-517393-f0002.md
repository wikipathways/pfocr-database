caption: 'Positive feedback loop involving the oxLDL/LOX-1 signaling pathway and LOX-1
  modulators. LDL is oxidized within the vascular wall under atherogenic conditions
  to form oxLDL. The binding of oxLDL to LOX-1 activates the NADPH oxidase on the
  cell membrane that results in the quick increase of intracellular ROS formation.
  Increased ROS activates the redox-sensitive NF-κB signaling pathway, generating
  three responses: (1) increases binding to LOX-1 promoter, therefore, increases LOX-1
  expression and amplifies LOX-1-mediated oxLDL uptake; (2) enhances Ang-II type 1
  receptor expression; (3) augments downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
  expression, such as P-selectin, E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and MCP-1, resulting
  in increased recruitment of monocytes to endothelial cells. LOX-1 modulators are
  demonstrated to function at each critical step of this feedback loop. oxLDL oxidized
  LDL, ROS reactive oxygen species, AT1R Ang-II type 1 receptor, NF-κB nuclear factor-kappa
