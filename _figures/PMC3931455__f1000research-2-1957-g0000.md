caption: Light regulated steps are in red. Dashed arrows denote multiple enzymatic
  steps and green arrows point to steps that are positively regulated by the GUN4
  protein, respectively. Tetrapyrrole intermediates and enzymes are shown in black
  and bold black type, respectively. Readers are advised to look in the text for full
  names of tetrapyrrole intermediates and enzymes, which are abbreviated in this figure.
