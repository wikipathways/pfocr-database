caption: 'Ubiquitin dependent and independent mitophagy. Upper panel: The best studied
  ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy mechanism is the PINK1-Parkin-dependent pathway. Briefly,
  extreme chemical stress promotes mitochondrial damage which triggers PINK1 stabilisation
  and activation on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). PINK1 recruits ubiquitin
  and the E3 ligase Parkin to the mitochondria and phosphorylates their respective
  Ser65 residues. Feed-forward amplification cycle signals result in coating of damaged
  mitochondria with ubiquitin, which promotes the recruitment of autophagy adaptors,
  phagophore biogenesis and engulfment. Engulfed mitochondria within autophagosomes
  are destroyed upon fusion with acidic endolysosomal subcompartment. Although PINK1
  and Parkin promote mitochondrial clearance in cultured proliferating cells, several
  studies demonstrate this pathway does not regulate physiological mitophagy within
  tissues. Lower panel: Ubiquitin-independent mitophagy. Basal and programmed mitophagy
  occur in tissues, likely in response to altered metabolic demands, states of insults
  that damage mitochondria. Phagophores form on mitochondria through the interaction
  of selective autophagy receptors (e.g., NIX, FUNDC1) with ATG8 proteins. NIX/BNIP3L
  is especially important during programmed mitophagy and metabolic maturation. NIX/BNIP3L
  phosphorylation enhances its association with ATG8 proteins. Loss of NIX/BNIP3L
  alters physiological mitophagy in the retina and reticulocytes. Several of the most
  promising therapeutic strategies to modulate mitophagy operate via ubiquitin-independent
  mechanisms.'
