caption: 'Schematic of rapid membrane receptor mediated mechanisms for enhancing memory
  by estradiol. Circulating estradiol can bind to various receptors in the cell membrane.
  At this time, the exact receptors and details of the binding have not been described,
  but evidence for activation of the pathways shown have been obtained (see text for
  details and references). Binding to the receptors results in activation of protein
  kinases which phosphorylate other proteins. These proteins then cause increases
  in synthesis of specific proteins through either phosphorylation of the transcription
  factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) located on DNA in the cell nucleus
  or through mRNAs located in the cytoplasm in dendrites or other areas. These actions
  result in structural changes at existing synapses as well as synaptogenesis that
  enhance memory formation, consolidation, storage and retrieval. Abbreviations: ERK,
  extracellular signal regulated kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; P13K/Akt,
  phosphatidylinositol3-kinase/Akt pathway; m pathway; mTOR, targets of rapamycin.
  Schematic adapted from  and .'
