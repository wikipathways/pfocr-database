caption: A proposed model of BR signaling in rice as compared with that in Arabidopsis.
  (Left) BR signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis. BR directly interacts with
  BRI1 and BAK1 to form the BRI1-BAK1 complex. The active BSKs phosphorylates BSU1.
  BSU1 dephosphorylates BIN2 and triggers its degradation. BZR1 is phosphorylated
  and inhibited by BIN2. (Right) BR signaling pathway in rice. BR binding to OsBRI1
  promotes association with OsBAK1. qGL39311 dephosphorylates and stabilizes OsGSK3,
  but qGL3N411 lacks this activity. OsGSK3 phosphorylates OsBZR1 and inhibits its
  activity. Protein names in red text indicate positive roles in BR signaling, whereas
  those in green text denote negative roles. BAK1, BRI1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1;
  BRI1, BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1; the “P” in orange circles indicate phosphorylation.
