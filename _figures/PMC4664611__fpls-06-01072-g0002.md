caption: Effect of in vitro modulation of PmitoKATP on ΔΨ and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production. (A) When ATP inhibits PmitoKATP and, as a consequence, the K+cycle
  due to the PmitoKATP-K+/H+ antiporter combined function, both high electrical membrane
  potential (ΔΨ) and high ROS production are observed. (B) On the contrary, in the
  presence of FFAs and their acyl-CoA derivatives, as well as of ROS, which activate
  PmitoKATP, K+cycle is activated and both low ΔΨ and low ROS production are observed.
  In isolated DWM the degree of PmitoKATP functioning is dependent on the balance
  among modulators; a fully opened channel may completely collapse ΔΨ and ROS production.
  The reducing equivalent flux through the respiratory chain to molecular oxygen and
  the coupled proton ejection into the intermembrane space are also indicated; + and
  – signs refer to ΔΨ. The continuous or dotted arrows refer to a more or less active
  pathway, respectively. SH2, reduced substrates; S, oxidized substrates; i.m.m.,
  inner mitochondrial membrane.
