caption: Proposed diagram of unique proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism of
  C. neoformans in response to r-javanicin. Based on the proteomics analysis, many
  of fungal enzymes associated with carbohydrate catabolism after r-javanicin treated
  are identified (red letters) such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD),
  pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (HBD), inositol
  oxygenase (IOX), and acetated kinase (AK). Purple letters are the intermediate molecules.
  Some enzymes in the pathway including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), acetaldehyde
  dehydrogenase (ALD), citrate synthase (CS) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) are
  also indicated. TCA = Tricarboxylic acid cycle; GYC = Glyoxylate cycle.
