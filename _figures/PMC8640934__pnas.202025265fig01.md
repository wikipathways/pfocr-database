caption: 'Combining pooled CRISPRi screening with bioorthogonal labeling to visualize
  phospholipase D signaling. (A) Scheme for pooled CRISPR screening based on bioorthogonal
  labeling to uncover regulators of the pathway of interest targeted by the bioorthogonal
  labeling step. (B) PLD-mediated PA synthesis and IMPACT method for detecting PLD
  activity. Top arrow: PLD signaling involves hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to
  generate the lipid second messenger PA. Bottom arrow: IMPACT as a means to generate
  fluorescent reporters of PLD signaling. IMPACT takes advantage of PLD-catalyzed
  transphosphatidylation with 3-azidopropanol followed by click chemistry tagging
  via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition with a fluorescent cyclooctyne reagent
  (BCN-BODIPY) to generate fluorescent phosphatidyl alcohol reporters to enable FACS-based
  enrichment of cells based on their PLD activity.'
