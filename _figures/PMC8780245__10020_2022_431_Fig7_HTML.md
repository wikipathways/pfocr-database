caption: RAGE-TLR4-pPKCβ1 signal pathway diagram. After AGEs was combined with RAGE,
  the expression of RAGE was up-regulated and PKCβ1 was activated together with TLR4,
  phosphorylated PKCβ1 was transferred from the cytoplasm to the membrane, and formed
  RAGE-TLR4-pPKCβ1 complex, then activated the TLR4 signaling pathway through the
  phosphorylation of IRAK4, which promoted the phosphorylation of NF-κB, and further
  promoted the immune maturation of dendritic cells and the expression of inflammatory
  factors
