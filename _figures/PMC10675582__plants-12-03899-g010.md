caption: Schematic representation of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway in ramie
  stems. In this case, the different metabolites are shown as a heat map in dashed
  boxes. Differentially expressed genes are indicated alongside their corresponding
  enzymes (presented as heat maps). The scale of the genes corresponds to the relative
  transcript level range of the enzymes
