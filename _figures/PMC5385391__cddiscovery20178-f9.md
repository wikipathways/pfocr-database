caption: HMGB1 release regulated by the PLCγ1–IP3R–SOC signalling pathway during calcium
  overload in hepatocytes. The proposed model showing the release of HMGB1 following
  H2O2 treatment. H2O2 activates the PLCγ1–IP3R–SOC signalling pathway, leading to
  calcium influx and the activation of calcium-dependent kinases PKCα and CAMKIV and
  triggering HMGB1 phosphorylation. Phosphorylated HMGB1 translocates from the nucleus
  to the cytoplasm and is ultimately released into the extracellular space.

  overload and 58-F interference.
