caption: A variety of seed gene sets were used to test the workflow’s performance.
  In all three cases, edges belonging to different signaling events are color-coded
  and corresponding pathway names are listed next to the networks. (a) A set of genes
  belonging to four different pathways were randomly selected. The analysis filled
  in the missing parts of these pathways and additionally highlighted functionally
  related signaling events. Seed genes are color-coded based on the pathways to which
  they belong. (b) Genes from a “tamoxifen recurrence” signature were used as seed
  genes to create a subnetwork highlighting how this approach can be used to improve
  functional annotations of a given set of genes. Genes from the signature are shown
  in yellow. (c) Genes from a “glucocorticoid resistance” signature were used as seed
  genes to identify signaling pathways associated with the resistance phenotype. Genes
  from the signature are shown in yellow.
