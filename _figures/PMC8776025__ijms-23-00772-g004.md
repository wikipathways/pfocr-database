caption: 'Simplified scheme of carbohydrate metabolism in K. lactis. The enzymes discussed
  in this work are highlighted in large red letters; other important enzymes are designated
  in smaller red letters. Cofactors are shown in blue. Glycolytic reactions are shown
  in the center of the upper part and to the right in the lower part. Directions of
  glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are indicated by bold arrows at the right. PPP designates
  the pentose phosphate pathway, GC the glyoxylate cycle (note that compartmentalization
  of the latter reactions is not depicted, here). Mitochondria are represented by
  the elliptical light-blue structure at the lower left. Dashed arrows indicate the
  action of multiple enzymes not specified for clarity. For more detailed schemes
  of the connected pathways, two former works may be consulted [,]. Enzyme abbreviations
  are: KlHxk1 = hexokinase, KlPgi1 = phosphoglucose isomerase, KlPfk1/2 = the hetero-octameric
  phospho-fructokinase formed by two types of subunits, KlTkl1 = transketolase, KlTal1
  = transaldolase, KlFba1 = fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, KlTpi1 = triosephosphate
  isomerase, KlTdh1, KlTdh2 = NAD+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases,
  KlGdp1 = NAD+/NADP+-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, KlGut1 =
