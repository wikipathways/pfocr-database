caption: 'The role of various miRNA families in liver fibrosis: Liver cells take and
  release exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs). Their role in liver fibrosis: Extracellular
  vesicles (EVs) derived from adipose tissue, HSCs, and neutrophils containing miR-155,
  -214, and -223, respectively, are taken up by liver cells, leading to increased
  insulin resistance by suppressing PPARγ. miR-214 in HSCs is shuttled by EVs to hepatocytes,
  resulting in inhibition of CCN2/Ccn2. Under a high-fat diet and alcohol consumption,
  miR-223 is elevated in hepatocytes, and attenuates NASH progression by targeting
  Cxcl10 and Taz. The miR-29 and miR-15 families regulate hepatic fibrosis in the
  following ways: (1) miR-29a targets AKT3 and PI3K, which helps to induce cell apoptosis
  through the caspase-9 cascade pathway; (2) PDGF and IGF receptors suppress the overall
  effect of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway; (3) miR-16 targets HGF and SMAD7, and
  blocks the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway; (4) miR-192 downregulates cyclin M1 and
  inhibits cell proliferation; (5) miR-1 promotes endothelial inflammation.'
