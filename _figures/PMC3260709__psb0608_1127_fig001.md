caption: Working model on the modulation of plant HMGR by PP2A. Plant HMGR is a transmembrane
  protein of the ER, having the N-terminal region and catalytic domain in the cytosol.
  HMGR is a regulatory enzyme of the cytokinin, brassinosteroid (BR) and prenyl moiety
  biosynthetic pathway and can thus play a role in the signaling of these molecules.
  HMGR also regulates the synthesis of MVA-derived phytoalexins. PP2A is an heterotrimeric
  enzyme that binds the N-terminal region of HMGR through its B″ regulatory subunit,
  which is a calcium-binding protein. Calcium can inhibit plant HMGR post-translationally.
  In response to salt stress, HMGR is submitted to post-translational negative control
  by PP2A through dephosphorylation and protein degradation mechanisms. Dephosphorylation
  of HMGR by PP2A does not occur at the conserved serine residue of the catalytic
  domain previously proposed to be phosphorylated by the SNF1-related kinase (SnRK1).
  In the response to salt stress, PP2A also mediates the increase of HMGR transcript
  levels. Control of HMGR by PP2A could be modulated by environmental or developmental
  calcium- and phytohormone-mediated signals. Some of these signals could derive from
  the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, thus allowing feedback regulation on HMGR.
