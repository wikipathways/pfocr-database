caption: A proposed function of CDK1 in regulating pluripotency. (a) The correlation
  of CDK1 activity with embryonic development, cell cycle, and self-renewal/differentiation.
  (b) Model of the CDK1-PDK1-PI3K/Akt kinase pathway for self-renewal and differentiation.
  CDK1 maintains phosphorylation of PDK1 and hyperactive Akt (indicated by +) for
  self-renewal via inhibiting pERK and maintaining GSK3β activity. Upon the reduction
  of CDK1 activity, the phosphorylation of PDK1 and Akt is sequentially suppressed
  (indicated by −); ERK inhibition is relieved to suppress GSK3β kinase, which results
  in stabilization of β-catenin. Subsequently, pSMAD2/3 and Wnt effectors cooperate
  to promote differentiation
