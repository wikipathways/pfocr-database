caption: Mechanisms how NFκB/RELA activates the SNAI/ZEB transcription factor module,
  triggering EMP. In differentiated airway epithelial cells, the core mesenchymal
  regulators SNAI1 and ZEB1 are suppressed by a double-negative feedback loop. SNAIL1
  inhibits the expression of miR-34, which represses the translation of SNAI1, whereas
  ZEB represses the induction of miR-200, which inhibits the translation of ZEB1.
  The mutual trans-repression is disrupted by the effects of NFκB/RELA to trigger
  synthesis of SNAI1 and ZEB1. RELA recruits the BRD4 coactivator to directly activate
  SNAI and ZEB1 genes to trigger the transition into EMP. EMP is a bistable state
  characterized by expression of genes controlling MET (OVOL, SMAD7, ESRP) as well
  as those controlling EMT (MMP9, TGFβ, IL6).
