caption: 'A schematic diagram of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (refer to []). Ubiquitin
  (Ub) is activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme in an adenosine-triphosphate-dependent
  manner. Ubiquitin-activating enzyme hydrolyzes adenosine-triphosphate and forms
  a complex with Ub. Subsequently, Ub is transferred to one of many different E2s.
  In some reactions, E2 (UBE2O) can directly ubiquitinate the substrate, while others
  need the help of ubiquitin ligases (E3s). E3s are currently categorized into three
  families, (i) Homologous to E6-associated Protein C-terminus (HECT), (ii) Really
  Interesting New Gene (RING), and (iii) U-box Domain []. The Cullin-RING ligases
  (CRLs), APC/C ligase, and RING-Between-RING ligases (RBRs) all belong to RING E3s.
  Ubiquitination of substrates occur as mentioned in the three ways: Monoubiquitination,
  multi-monoubiquitination, and polyubiquitination (including linear polyubiquitination
  and branched polyubiquitination).'
