caption: Scheme representing the signaling network of ABA regulatory pathway at the
  core of the circadian oscillator. In the morning, the biosynthesis of ABA is blocked
  through the negative impact of LHY on the NCED as the rate-limiting component of
  the ABA biosynthesis pathway. Later, following noon, when the plant gets rid of
  the negative impact of LHY on the NCED, ABA is present and its signal transduction
  pathway would activate the ABA-responsive genes, leading to stomatal closure.
