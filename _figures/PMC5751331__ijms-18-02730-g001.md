caption: Schematic diagram of lysophospholipid-mediated PPARγ signaling. Lysophosphatidylcholine
  (LPC) is a bioactive phospholipid generated primarily by the action of phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) enzymes on the plasma membrane. After cellular uptake, free LPC is reacylated
  yielding PC or deacylated yielding FA and choline. LPA and AGP are generated intracellularly
  in a stimulus-coupled manner by the ATX or PLA2 enzyme. cPA is generated intracellularly
  in a stimulus-coupled manner by the PLD2 enzyme. LPA and AGP induced neointima formation
  through the activation of PPARγ, whereas cPA inhibited PPARγ-mediated arterial wall
  remodeling in a noninjury infusion model. However, the physiological context of
  cPA in PPARγ signaling in brain is still unclear. Imbalance of the PPARγ agonist-antagonist
  equilibrium is involved in changes in cellular functions, including ROS generation,
  NOS and cytokine expression. These endogenous lysophospholipids regulate PPARγ function
  required for vascular wall pathologies, and metabolic-related diseases. PPRE (PPAR
  response element); RXR (retinoid X receptor); ATX (autotaxin).
