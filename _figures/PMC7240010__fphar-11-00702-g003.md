caption: Neuroprotective effects of H2S in Parkinson’s disease. Oxidative stress,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis has been considered as possible mechanisms
  to cause Parkinson’s disease, thereby leading to ERS. MPP+ is the active metabolite
  of MPTP, which functions to stimulate the generation of superoxide radicals in vitro
  and induce cell apoptosis. H2S can attenuate the MPTP-induced accumulation of ROS,
  thereby reducing oxidative stress and ERS. UCP2 can function for H2S to reduce ROS
  production, acting upstream of KATP channels. In addition, H2S can directly and
  indirectly reduce ROS accumulation through the KATP/PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 pathway.
