caption: A current model of the PSK signaling pathway.PSK binds to its receptors,
  the PSKRs, causing recruitment of the BAK1/SERKs co-receptors to the complex and
  leading to the phosphorylation, guanylate cyclase and CaM binding activities of
  the PSKRs. These early events initiate a downstream signaling cascade that regulates
  plant cell division, cell expansion, immunity response and other critical processes.
  PSKR1/ALR1 serves as a sensor for monitoring intracellular aluminum ions
