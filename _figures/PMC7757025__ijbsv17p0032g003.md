caption: Signal transduction of βII spectrin in tumor. Loss of Smad4 and βII spectrin
  was observed in Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma tissue sections. The absence
  of βII spectrin/Smad4 will interrupt TGF-β signaling, which may activate Notch signaling
  through the Notch signaling molecule Hes-1. In CD133+ LSCs, TAK1-NFκB signal and
  TGF-β signaling pathway activated kinase 1 (TAK1; MAP3K7), leading to increased
  production of metastatic CSCs. Treatment of AML-12 cells with insulin (100 nM) activates
  the PI3K/Akt pathway, which increases phosphor-Akt expression and nuclear translocation
  of Smad2, 3 and 4. LY294002 is an inhibitor of PI3K that can completely block Akt
  phosphorylation and can also reduce βII spectrin, Smad 3 and 4 in the nucleus. βII
  spectrin is involved in hepatocyte proliferation through the interaction of TGF-β/Smad
  and PI3K/AKT signalling. PI3K/pAkt signalling activated TGF-β/Smad pathway, and
  activation of TGF-β/Smad pathway downregulated PI3K/pAkt signallings. CEACAM1-4L
  can interact with βII spectrin, promote nuclear translocation of Smad3 in advanced
  HCC. TGF-β signaling pathway upregulates Fancd2 expression mediated by βII spectrin
  and Smad3, thereby conferring genomic stability. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
  TLR4 activates NANOG, NANOG induces IGF2BP3 and YAP1, IGF2BP3 blocks the phosphorylation
  of SMAD3, YAP1 blocks the nuclear translocation of p-SMAD3. IGF2BP3-mediated activation
  of AKT phosphorylates YAP1, enhancing YAP1's ability to block nuclear translocation
  of p-SMAD3. YAP1 may interact with SMAD7, and enhance the inhibitory activity and
  nuclear translocation of SMAD7 on TGF-β/SMAD3 signaling. By drinking alcohol, inhibiting
  βII spectrin in liver cancer cells can significantly increase the expression of
  TLR4. IL6 can activate transcriptional activator 3 (STAT3), βII spectrin prevented
  the development of HCC by downregulating the expression of signal transducer and
  STAT3. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, miR-145 induces downregulation of βII spectrin.
