caption: The self-sustaining cycle that regenerates coenzyme bound to PGDH during
  biosynthesis of l-serine in E. coli. The NADH that is produced during the conversion
  of PGA to PHP is converted back to NAD+in situ by conversion of αKG to αHG. The
  αKG is formed from glutamate by the second enzyme in the pathway, PSAT. Reprinted
