caption: 'Schematics describing the general biochemical network designs reviewed in
  the Network Extension section. (A) A two-promoter construct containing an interchangeable
  sensitivity tuner, which comprises the gene for a transcriptional activator protein
  and its cognate promoter. Our schematic has been drawn based on the description
  provided in ref (). (B) From ref (). Transcriptional cascade comprising one, two,
  and three repression stages. Hooshangi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 102, 3581–3586.
  Copyright 2005 National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A. (C) From ref (). An internal
  feedback loop is engineered into the yeast mating MAPK pathway via the downstream
  expression of a pathway modulator protein that binds to the Ste5 scaffold protein
  through a leucine zipper interaction. Feedback polarity is determined by the choice
  of either a positive or negative modulator, which up- or down-regulates the MAPK
  cascade, respectively; feedback gain is tuned by varying promoter strength or varying
  the leucine zipper domains to affect binding affinity. From Bashor, et al., Science,
  2008, 319, 1539. Adapted with permission from AAAS. (D) From ref (). Two coupled
  positive feedback loops are engineered into a two-component signaling system via
  downstream expression of both the transmembrane receptor and intracellular TF proteins.

  Palani et al., 7, 7, copyright 2011. (E) From ref (). Two parallel pathways constitutively
  repress the expression of an output protein. One pathway uses a TF repressor to
  repress transcription, while the other pathway represses translation using an shRNA
  to induce RNAi-mediated mRNA degradation. In the bottom schematic, a single input
  signal down-regulates TF and shRNA production thereby up-regulating expression of
  the output protein. Adapted from Cell 130, Deans et al. A tunable genetic switch
