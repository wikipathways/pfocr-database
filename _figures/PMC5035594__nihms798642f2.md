caption: 'Activators of PLCγ known to activate the UPR are in bold. * indicates the
  activating tyrosine kinase has not been identified. #Ecdysone acts with a GPCR to
  open the IP3R calcium channels, but activation of the UPR arms has not been investigated.
  Tyrosine kinases that activate PLCγ are expected to activate the anticipatory UPR
  pathway. Peptide hormone receptors that are membrane tyrosine kinases that activate
  PLCγ are shown on the left. Src kinase has also been shown to activate PLCγ. Several
  steroid hormones activate Src kinase and are likely activators of the anticipatory
  UPR pathway (center). Immunoreceptors, shown on the bottom, working through GPCRs
  and Src family kinases are not mitogenic hormones and instead activate the UPR to
  antcipate the increased protein folding load that accompanies antibody production.'
