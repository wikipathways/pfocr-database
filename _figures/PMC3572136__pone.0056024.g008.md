caption: (A) The KDM5B, E2F1 and NEUROG3 pathway described in the text. Arrows within
  the blue boxes indicate predicted increases (green) or decreases (red) in activity
  of the given protein between day 8 and day 11. The pie charts indicate the number
  of gene expression changes between day 8 and day 11 that are correctly (blue) and
  incorrectly (red) predicted. Genes regulated by each protein are indicated on the
  right. Blue arrows indicate activation of gene expression by the protein and red
  arrows indicate inhibition. The red stop symbol indicates that KDM5B is a known
  inhibitor of E2F1 expression and the green cross that E2F1 is a known activator
  of NEUROG3 expression. (B) The IL6, SOCS3 and STAT3 pathway. All details as for
  (A). (C) A network of causal drivers for gene expression changes between day 8 and
  day 11. Species predicted to have increased activity at day 11 are given in yellow
  boxes, species predicted to have decreased activity are given in purple. The two
  pathways discussed in the text are highlighted by dashed lines and red arrows. Grey
  arrows indicate known regulatory interactions between species (both activating and
  inhibiting).
