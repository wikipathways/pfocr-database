caption: Schematic drawing of glucose metabolism via pyruvate in neurons (left-N)
  and astrocytes (right-A) and of glutamine-glutamate (GABA) cycling. One molecule
  glucose is metabolized by glycolysis in the cytosol to two molecules of pyruvate
  in a complex and strictly regulated pathway, where one oxidative process requires
  transfer of reducing equivalents to the mitochondria by the malate-aspartate shuttle
  (MAS). In both neurons and astrocytes pyruvate metabolism via acetyl Coenzyme A
  (ac.CoA) leads to formation of citrate by condensation with pre-existing oxaloacetate
  (OAA) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), an end result of the previous turn
  of the cycle. Citrate oxidation in the TCA cycle includes two decarboxylations,
  leading to production of large amounts of energy (ATP) in the electron transport
  chain and at the end of the cycle to the re-formation of OAA which enables another
  turn of the cycle. Pyruvate carboxylation, which is active in astrocytes, but absent
  in neurons, creates a new molecule of OAA, which after condensation with ac.CoA,
  derived from a second molecule of pyruvate, forms a new molecule of citrate. This
  allows utilization of a TCA cycle constituent for glutamate formation and export
  to neurons in the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The formation of the two molecules
  of pyruvate requires use of glucose and contributes to the association between the
  glutamate-glutamine cycle shown in Figure  and to activation-induced preferential
  glycolysis. However, only about 25% of the glutamate/glutamine carried in the cycle
  is normally newly synthesized, although synthesis can increase during intense stimulation.
  For glutamate synthesis α-ketoglutarate (αKG), an intermediate of the TCA cycle,
  is formed from citrate via isocitrate, and the single decarboxylation which is involved
  reduces but does not abolish the effect on preferential glycolysis, because two
  decarboxylations occur in the full TCA cycle. αKG can leave the cycle to form glutamate
  (glu), catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase. Further metabolism by the cytosolic
  and astrocyte-specific enzyme glutamine synthetase leads to the formation of glutamine
  (gln). In glutamatergic neurons all glutamate formed by deamidation of glutamine,
  shown in red, enters the mitochondria (mit) and is returned to the cytosol in a
  complex process, which requires simultaneous glucose metabolism, as illustrated
  in Figure . This requirement may explain about one half of the association of the
  cycle with glucose utilization and must be a major contributor to activation-induced
  preferential glycolysis. It is followed by accumulation of glutamate into vesicles,
  also shown in red, which to a major extent uses glycolytically derived ATP. In GABAergic
  neurons the pathway via mitochondria is only used for some glutamate, from which
  GABA is formed, whereas the remainder enters the cytosol directly. Released glutamate
  acts on glutamate receptors to cause neuronal stimulation, accompanied by K+ release
  and subsequent re-uptake initially in astrocytes and subsequently neurons. At least
  the astrocytic uptake partly depends upon glycolytically derived energy (see Figures
  ), which may contribute substantially to activation-induced preferential increase
  in glycolysis. Extracellular glutamate is almost quantitatively re-accumulated in
  astrocytes, together with at least part of the released GABA [upper line of the
  glutamine–glutamate/GABA cycle (glu–gln cycle)] and re-accumulated in the astrocytic
  cytosol. Here, about 75% is converted to glutamine and re-enters the glutamine–glutamate/GABA
  cycle. The remaining ~25% is oxidatively degraded, via one of two partly different
  pathways. In both αKG is reconverted to malate. In one malate exits to the cytosol,
  is decarboxylated by cytosolic malic enzyme to pyruvate, which is oxidized in the
  TCA cycle via ac.CoA. Oxidation of glutamate and glutamate-derived pyruvate may
  explain part of the post-stimulatory increase in oxidative metabolism relative to
  glycolysis observed by Madsen et al. (). In the other malate does not exit the TCA
  cycle but may be further metabolized to αKG after condensation with ac.CoA, allowing
  re-synthesis of another molecule of glutamate from only one molecule pyruvate. In
  either case the degraded glutamate must be replaced by a quantitatively similar
  production of glutamate from glucose, in the first case by complete de novo synthesis
  from one molecule glucose, in the second from one half of a glucose molecule. Modified
