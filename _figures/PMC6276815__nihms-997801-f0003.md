caption: a | During direct conversion into induced neurons (iNs), fibroblasts progressively
  convert into neurons through an as yet poorly defined transient intermediate state.
  This process involves dramatic morphological changes but no cell division. General
  pro-neuronal transcription factors (TFs) such as achaete-scute homologue 1 (ASCL1)
  and neurogenin 2 (NGN2) act as pioneer transcription factors that trigger the expression
  of structural neuronal proteins such tau (which help to drive the establishment
  of neuronal compartments such as the axon or dendrites), neurotransmitter receptors
  (which are required for postsynaptic structures), and ion channels (which build
  up a neuronal membrane potential),. Pioneer transcription factors also open chromatin
  structures to allow binding of secondary transcription factors (both transgenic
  and endogenous) that facilitate the expression of more mature or subtype-specific
  proteins, such as the enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or tryptophan hydroxylase
  (TPH), which are needed for dopamine or serotonin production, respectively. b |
  The relative timeframe for direct iN conversion using different approaches. Orange
  bars indicate the stage at which the respective factors or compounds are believed
  to be effective. General pro-neuronal pioneer transcription factors such as ASCL1
  and NGN2 work to reprogramme the cells at the fibroblast stage and tend to result
  in the production of glutamatergic neurons (the majority) and GABAergic neurons
  (a minor fraction). Secondary transcription factors such as neurogenic differentiation
  factor 1 (NEUROD1), BRN2 and myelin transcription factor 1-like protein (MYT1L)
  are not sufficient to initiate iN conversion but support the process at later stages,,.
  c | To facilitate neurotransmitter-specific iN conversion, cocktails of specific
  transcription factors can be added to shape a specific neuronal identity. These
  lineage-specifying transcription factors are typically well known for their essential
  roles during the development of the targeted neuronal subtype in vivo,,,,–,. d |
  Manipulation of signal transduction pathways through growth factors and small molecules
  that inhibit the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)–ALK–SMAD pathway and glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), as well as the promotion of cyclic AMP signalling, increases
  iN conversion efficiencies. Addition of other molecules (such as I-BET151, isoxazole
  9 (ISX9) or protein kinase C (PKC), JUN amino-terminal kinase (JNK) or RHO-associated
  protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors) to that mix facilitates direct conversion from
