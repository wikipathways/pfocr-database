caption: 'Schematic diagram of some immune cells regulated by IL-27. The secretion
  of IL-27 can be observed in various immune cells, including dendritic cells, monocytes,
  macrophages, plasma cells, and natural killer cells. IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine
  consisting of two subunits: EBI-3 and P28. The receptor for IL-27 is composed of
  WSX-1 (IL-27Rα) and gp130. Upon receptor activation, it exerts regulatory effects
  on downstream immune cells through JAK/STATs, MAPK pathways, as well as other signaling
  cascades that remain to be elucidated. IL-27 is a unique bidirectional regulator
  of inflammation, exerting a broad and significant regulatory role in diverse immune
  cell populations. It has the ability to activate STAT3, inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis
  of CD4+T cells, and promote the expansion of CD4+T cells. Additionally, IL-27 facilitates
  the differentiation of Th0 cells into Th1 while suppressing their differentiation
  into Th2 by inhibiting GATA-3 expression through the STAT1 pathway. Moreover, IL-27
  can impede the differentiation of Th0 cells into Th17 via activation of the STAT1
  pathway. The stimulation of IL-27 can induce B cells to secrete T-bet and IgG2a,
  while inhibiting the secretion of IgG1 by B cells through STAT1 signaling. The expression
  of T-bet and GzmB in NK cells was promoted by IL-27 via the STAT1/3 pathway, thereby
  augmenting the functionality of NK cells through stimulation of IFN-γ secretion
  mediated by the STAT1 signal. The activation of STAT1/2/3/4/5 signaling in CD8+T
  cells by IL-27 leads to the direct release of Prf and GzmB, enabling the killing
  of tumor cells. The activation of STAT1 in macrophages by IL-27 leads to the augmentation
  of TLR-induced reduction in IL-10 and inflammation. Simultaneously, it attenuates
  the impact of TNF-α on human macrophages, thereby exerting an anti-inflammatory
  effect through a feedback mechanism. The expression of TLR4 in monocytes can be
  enhanced by IL-27 through the activation of STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathway, leading
  to the upregulation of downstream IL-6 and TNF-α expression. The expression of programmed
  death-related factor B7-H1 in DC can be up-regulated by IL-27, thereby inhibiting
  its function in promoting T cell proliferation'
