caption: Molecular mechanisms and cellular physiology of pyroptosis. The molecular
  mechanism of pyroptosis is primarily divided into the canonical pathway (dependent
  on caspase-1) and the noncanonical pathway (dependent on caspase-4/5/11 or mediated
  by caspase-3 or caspase-8). (A) NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, AIM2, and pyrin inflammasomes
  trigger pyroptosis by inducing the activation of caspase-1. Here, the NLRP3 inflammasome
  is shown as an example in the figure. The pathway is mainly initiated through the
  binding of DAMPs or PAMPs to PRRs. PRRs can then recruit the adaptor ASC and pro-caspase-1
  to form inflammasomes (the NLRP1 and NLRC4 inflammasomes are exceptions in which
  ASC is not needed). Procaspase-1 is cleaved by inflammasomes to activate caspase-1,
  and activated caspase-1 leads to the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 and the cleavage
  of GSDMD at 272FLTD275 to generate the N- and C-termini. The N-terminus forms oligomers
  and translocates to the cell membrane, which finally induces pyroptosis and the
  secretion of intracellular substances, such as IL-1β, IL-18, HMGB1, ATP, and LDH.
  Moreover, the released cytokines and DAMPs trigger inflammation and the subsequent
  immune response. (B) The caspase-4/-5/-11-dependent noncanonical pathway is triggered
  by LPS directly interacting with the CARD of pro-caspase-4/-5/-11 (caspase-4/-5
  in humans; caspase-11 in mice). Subsequently, this interaction contributes to the
  activation of caspase and the cleavage of GSDMD to yield the N- and C-termini. The
  N-terminus forms oligomers and translocates to the cell membrane to induce pyroptosis.
  (C) The caspase-3-mediated noncanonical pathway is primarily initiated by chemotherapies,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, or the accumulation of generated ROS. This pathway shares
  a common upstream signaling pathway with apoptosis; nevertheless, the switch between
  apoptosis and pyroptosis depends on the cellular content of GSDME. Chemotherapy
  induces the translocation of BAX/BAK to the mitochondrial outer membrane to form
  pores, resulting in MOMP and cytochrome C release. Subsequently, this process even
  sequentially activates caspase-9 and caspase-3. Moreover, caspase-3 is also activated
  by death receptor signaling-induced caspase-8. Activated caspase-3 can cleave GSDME
  after Asp270 to generate the C- and N-termini. Similarly, the N-terminus forms oligomers
  and translocates to the cell membrane to induce pyroptosis. (D) GSDMC is upregulated
  by the PD-L1/p-STAT3 axis and specifically cleaved by death receptor signaling-induced
  caspase-8. The GSDMC N-terminus forms oligomers and translocates to the cell membrane
  to induce pyroptosis.
