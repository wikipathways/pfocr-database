caption: Protein interactome involved in neuroendocrine neoplasm proliferation.Proliferative
  signaling includes a tightly regulated signaling interactome (including RAS/RAF,
  MAPK, and PI3K/Akt). The number and extent of linkages illustrates the potential
  for pathway cross-activation and redundancy in signaling. CCND1 (cyclin D1) represents
  a nexus focus involved in regulation of G1/S transition during the cell cycle. Known
  mutations in the interactome are identified (red); the size being reflective of
  the frequency of mutations (ie, MEN1/ATRX/DAXX mutations occur in 40%–50%, mTOR
  ∼15%, P27KIP1 ∼10%). These are largely peripherally localized (except for P27, regulator
  of G1 progression), which is consistent with their known tumor-suppressor function.
  Targeting the somatostatin receptor family has clinical utility as an antiproliferative
  strategy, but there is no direct link between these receptors and proliferative
  signaling pathways. Because these somatostatin receptors interact with protein kinase
  C, this may provide a potential link by indirect inhibition of mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Current data renders it unlikely that somatostatin
  inhibitory effects are transduced via proliferative signaling inhibition. Created
  with protein/transcripts identified in neuroendocrine neoplasms and String 9.1.
