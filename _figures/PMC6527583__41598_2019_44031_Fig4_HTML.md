caption: 'Acute phase response network: The acute phase response was the most-significantly
  represented pathway common to all CAPN5-NIV stages. There were 25 acute phase response
  proteins elevated in CAPN5-NIV. Results are displayed as a protein interaction network
  with proteins (nodes) represented as circles and connected by lines representing
  predicted or experimentally-confirmed interactions (edges). Nodes are highlighted
  by their respective molecular pathway or function: complement cascade, coagulation
  cascade, and molecular transport.'
