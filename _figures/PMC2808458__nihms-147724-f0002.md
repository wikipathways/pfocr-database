caption: PI3K physically interacts with multiple TLRs as well as MyD88. Activated
  PI3K regulates TLR signaling in both positive and negative ways. Inactivation of
  GSK3 by PI3K-Akt enhances the transcription of IL10 by allowing CREB DNA binding
  as well as CREB-CBP association. IL-12 transcription is inhibited due to decreased
  association of NF-kB with CBP. PI3K-Akt also phosphorylates mTOR which leads to
  the phosphorylation and activation of IRF-7 as well as enhanced production of type
  I IFNs. PI3K-Akt pathway is also involved in cell proliferation or survival induced
  by multiple TLR ligands through degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27.
