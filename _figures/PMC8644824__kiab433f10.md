caption: 'Graphical summary of NHP-induced gene expression at basal SA levels. NHP-induced
  expression of selected SAR genes (shown in red) requires NPR1 and resting SA levels.
  It is currently unknown, whether SA is constitutively bound to NPR1 or whether NHP
  sensitizes NPR1 for SA binding. The NPR1/SA/TGA complex directly activates transcription
  of genes encoding unidentified secondary transcription factor(s) (TF) and SARD1/CBP60g.
  The TF(s) activate transcription of PAD4 and EDS1, with PAD4 being required for
  NPR1 protein accumulation. EDS1 and PAD4 are essential for the induction of a subset
  of SAR genes, including those involved in NHP and SA synthesis (ALD1, FMO1, ICS1,
  PBS3). SARD1/CBP60g amplifies transcription. Most SAR genes (e.g. PR1) are induced
  at a very low expression level which is amplified by SA through the established
  NPR1/TGA signaling module (blue). Red: NHP pathway. Blue: SA pathway. White arrow:
  effect on NPR1 protein level. Shaded arrows: activation of transcription. Dashed
  arrows: unknown mechanism. The question mark refers to the fact that the contribution
  of SARD1/CBP60g to the pathway was not analyzed in the sid2 background.'
