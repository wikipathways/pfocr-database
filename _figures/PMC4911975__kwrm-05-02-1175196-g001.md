caption: A model of the regulatory network governing L1 development in response to
  nutrient availability. The gross anatomy of an L1 larva is depicted, with the nervous
  system, epidermis and intestine presented in different colors. Chemosensory and
  other neurons sense external nutrient status and regulate secretion of ILPs ins-4,
  ins-6 and daf-28. Intestinal cells autonomously sense internal nutrient status and
  regulate expression and secretion of ins-4, ins-6 and daf-28. These three ILPs,
  and possibly others, signal to daf-2/InsR in the nervous system, intestine and epidermis.
  daf-2 signals through the PI3K pathway to antagonize daf-16/FoxO in each of those
  tissues. daf-16 inhibits daf-12/NHR and dbl-1/TGF-β signaling by repressing, directly
  or indirectly, transcription of different components of each pathway in different
  tissues. Signaling activity may also be regulated post-transcriptionally. daf-12/NHR
  and dbl-1/TGF-β signaling promote L1 development in fed larvae, and their inhibition
  by daf-16 promotes L1 arrest. daf-16 also promotes starvation resistance, but it
  does so through other, unidentified effector genes. daf-16 also activates and represses
  transcription of different ILPs, producing positive and negative feedback. This
  feedback, or FOXO-to-FOXO signaling, couples the state of the insulin-like signaling
  pathway within and between tissues and potentially contributes to phenotypic variation
  among individuals.
