caption: PD-1 in T-cell activation, exhaustion, and effector function. (A) T cells
  are activated via (1) binding of MHC plus peptide on an APC to the TCR and then
  (2) binding of APC CD80/86 to T-cell CD28. In patients with cancer, tumor cells
  can also serve as APCs. Upon T-cell activation, PD-1 expression is induced. (B)
  In situations of chronic infection or persistent stimulation, PD-L1 signals through
  T-cell PD-1 to “turn off” T cells in order to minimize damage to healthy tissue.
  Tumor cells can upregulate PD-L1 in order to “turn off” T cells that might destroy
  them. (C) Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway allows T cells to maintain their
  effector functions. In patients with cancer, activated tumor-specific T cells can
  kill tumor cells and secrete cytokines that activate/recruit other immune cells
  to participate in the antitumor response. APC, antigen-presenting cell; IFN-γ, interferon
  gamma; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1, PD
  ligand 1; TCR, T-cell receptor.
