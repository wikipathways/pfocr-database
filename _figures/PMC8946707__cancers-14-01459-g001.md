caption: Notch signaling pathway. The interaction between Delta-like or Jagged-like
  ligands and NOTCH entails the activation of the signaling pathway. Whereas the extracellular
  domain (NECD) is split by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), the intracellular
  domain (NICD) is released by γ-secretase. Therefore, NICD translocates into the
  nucleus, displacing the co-repressor proteins (CoR) and promoting the target genes
  with the assistance of co-activators proteins (CoA) and CSL (CBF1/RBPJ-κ, suppressor
  of Hairless and LAG1). The common therapy target is by inhibiting γ-secretase; these
  types of drugs are collectively known as Gamma Secretase Inhibitors (GSIs). Nevertheless,
  blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is another strategy to inhibit Notch signaling.
