caption: The two main pathways involved in apoptosis regulation. (a) The extrinsic
  pathway begins outside the cell through the activation of receptors on the cell
  surface by specific molecules known as pro-apoptotic ligands, including CD95L/FasL
  (receptor CD95/Fas). Once activated, the death domains of these receptors bind to
  the adapter protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD), resulting in the assembly
  of death-induced signaling complex (DISC) and recruitment and assembly of initiator
  caspases 8 and 10. The two caspases are stimulated and processed, releasing active
  enzyme molecules into the cytosol, where they activate caspases 3, 6, and 7, thereby
  converging on the intrinsic pathway. (b) The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway is
  initiated in response to cellular signals resulting from DNA damage, a defective
  cell cycle, detachment from the extracellular matrix, hypoxia, loss of cell survival
  factors, or other types of severe cell stress. This triggers activation of specific
  members of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family involved in the promotion of apoptosis,
  Puma and Noxa, which in turn activate the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax or Bak. These
  two proteins move to the mitochondrial membrane and disrupt the anti-apoptotic function
  of the Bcl-2 family proteins, allowing for permeabilization of the mitochondrial
  membrane. Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activating factor 1; Bad, Bcl-2/Bcl-XL-associated
  death domain protein; Bak, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist-killer protein; Bax, Bcl-2-associated
  X protein; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma-2; Bcl-XL, Bcl-2-related gene, long form; Bid,
  Bcl-2-interacting domain; Bim, Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death; Casp, caspase;
  Cyt c, cytochrome c; E2, 17β-estradiol; ER, estrogen receptor; ERE, estrogen-responsive
  element; FasL, Fas ligand; FLIP, FLICE-inhibitory protein; IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis;
  Noxa, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced protein 1; Puma, p53-upregulated modulator
  of apoptosis.
