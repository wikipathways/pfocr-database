caption: New findings on precursors of HSCs. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are believed
  to develop from hemogenic endothelium (EC) cells. The earliest HSCs that are capable
  of reconstitution potential emerge at embryonic day (E) 10.5 in aorta-gonad-mesonephros
  (AGM) region, then later migrate to fetal liver, and finally settle in the future
  adult bone marrow and spleen. The identification of cell surface markers of different
  stage HSCs facilitate for efficient enrichment of HSCs, thus to elucidate HSC development
  transcriptional machinery. Recently, CD201 (endothelial protein C receptor, EPCR)
  was identified as a pre-hematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs) surface marker for the
  first time. By isolation and analyses of pre-HSCs at single cell levels, unique
  cell-cycle features of pre-HSCs were discovered. Different from past studies that
  most of adult HSCs reside in G0 phase and none of the S/G2/M phase adult HSCs could
  successfully reconstitute, transplantation of S/G2/M phase pre-HSCs demonstrates
  most robust reconstitution capability, G0 phase pre-HSCs show moderate activity,
  and none of the G1 phase pre-HSCs is able to reconstitute. During the development
  of HSCs, activation of mammalian targets of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is
  fundamental for HSCs emergence
