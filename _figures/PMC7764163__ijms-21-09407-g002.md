caption: 'A simplified canonical NF-κB signaling pathway with its many deubiquitinating
  regulators and the molecular targets of those enzymes. Only a handful of all possible
  interactions between deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and NF-κB pathway components
  are currently known and an even lesser amount of all the possible interactions are
  displayed here. (A) Canonical signaling in the NF-κB pathway consists of various
  receptors, where the signal is transduced through a cross-linked network of protein
  complexes and reaches the NF-κB heterodimeric subunits sequestrated in the cytosol.
  The signal from TNFα assembles the RIPK1 complex at the site of its binding with
  the receptor, which directs TAK1 to phosphorylate the IKK complex. In consequence,
  the IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitor unit of sequestrated NF-κB proteins,
  which marks it for proteasomal degradation. After the proteolysis, the activated
  NF-κB heterodimer translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of target
  genes. Ubiquitin poly-chains, anchored by several amino acid residues (M1, K48 and
  K63, respectively, which, for the sake of the reading coherency, were not distinguished
  in this figure) to target proteins, fill a multitude of different roles: they create
  linkages and bridges between components and mark them for degradation or create
  additional signals. DUBs: A20 and CYLD are the key deubiquitinating regulators that
  not only remove ubiquitin chains from targets, but also bind to them. In addition,
  OTUB1’s novel role as an NF-κB inhibitor in the non-canonical pathway (not shown
  here). (B) Several Ub interactions of DUBs and the NF-κB effectors. A20 binds to
  M1-linked bridges between RIPK1 and NEMO, prohibiting other Ub-binding proteins
  from attachment and sequestrating the NF-κB-inducing signal. It also removes Ub
  chains from IκBα, thus disallowing its degradation and it replaces the Ub chain
  (from K63 to K48) on RIPK1, thus marking it for degradation. In addition, there
  is CYLD that competes with A20 on NEMO or RIPK1 degradation and affects several
  signaling components. Lastly, OTUB1 stabilizes p100, a progenitor protein of p52,
  which inhibits proteolytic degradation of p100 to 52, thus sequestrating the signal
  in the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Based on [,,,]. Legend: black arrow—indicates
