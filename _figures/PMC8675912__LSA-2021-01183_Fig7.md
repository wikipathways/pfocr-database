caption: (A) In healthy brains, tau binds and stabilizes microtubules. β-arrestins
  mediate the desensitization and internalization of ligand-stimulated G protein–coupled
  receptors (GPCRs). This activity is also required for ligand-induced tau phosphorylation
  via kinases ERK, GSK3β, and CDK5. However, the autophagy cargo receptor p62/SQSTM1
  readily binds and clears hyperphosphorylated tau through the autophagy-lysosome
  pathway. (B) In FTLD-tau and Alzheimer’s disease brains, (1) GPCRs (β2AR & mGluR2)
  and β-arrestins1/2 are up-regulated, which drive tau phosphorylation upon ligand-induced
  stimulation. Also, (2) increased β-arrestin1 promotes tau dissociation from microtubules,
  thereby simultaneously disrupting microtubule stability and enabling tau missorting
  and phosphorylation. Furthermore, (3) β-arrestins1/2 inhibit p62-mediated clearance
  of pathogenic tau by blocking p62 body formation. Hence, the combined effects of
  β-arrestin1 in GPCR ligand-stimulated tau phosphorylation, tau displacement/missorting,
  microtubule disruption, and impaired p62-mediated tau clearance ultimately drive
  tauopathy in Alzheimer’s disease and FTLD-tau.
