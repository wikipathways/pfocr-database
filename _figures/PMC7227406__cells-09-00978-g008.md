caption: Overview of the regulation of ACS7 protein turnover. ACS7 is the only type
  III ACC synthase in Arabidopsis and is characterized by a unique structure with
  no regulatory domains, despite the fact that ACS7 protein undergoes proteasomal
  degradation. Phosphorylation mediated by CDPK and/or MAP kinases results in ACS7
  activation and an increase in ethylene biosynthesis. Protein phosphatases type A
  (ABI1, ABI2 and HAB1) remove the phosphate group from ACS7, which in turn inhibits
  its activity and promotes ubiquitination mediated by the XBAT32 E3 ubiquitin ligase.
  After ubiquitination, ACS7 is immediately directed for degradation via the proteasome
  pathway, and ethylene biosynthesis driven by ACS7 is thus restricted.
