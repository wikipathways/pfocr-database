caption: Strategies for efficient oral delivery via lipid-based nanocarriers. (1)
  Improvement of the stability of nanocarriers in the harsh gastrointestinal environment
  that includes enzymes, salts and microbiota. (2) Enhancement of mucoadhesion. Nanocarriers
  remain adhered to the mucus and thereby their residence time is increased. The cargo
  molecule may be released. (3) Enhancement of mucodiffusion. Nanocarriers diffuse
  through the mucus, increasing the chances for their interaction with the epithelium.
  (4) Inhibition of P-glycoprotein. Drug efflux may be decreased, increasing drug
  effective absorption. (5) Active targeting. (5.1) The surface of lipid-based nanocarriers
  can be functionalised with ligand that interact with specific cell populations,
  e.g. enterocytes or goblet cells. (5.2) Lipid-based nanocarriers can act as targeting
  ligands by themselves. (6) Enhancement of lymphatic transport, transport pathway
  that avoids first pass effect. (6.1) Chylomicrons, including lipids and hydrophobic
  cargo molecules from the internalised nanocarriers, are generated within enterocytes
  and absorbed by the lymphatic system. (6.2) Lymphatic uptake can be also achieved
  via M cells
