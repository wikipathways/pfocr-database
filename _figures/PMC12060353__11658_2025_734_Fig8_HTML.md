caption: Aseptic inflammation caused by acinar cell injury leads to local tissue hypoxia.
  The hypoxic environment causes a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential
  of pancreatic stellate cells and the release of reactive oxygen species. Reactive
  oxygen species activate the NF-κB signaling pathway, and the nuclear entry of pP65
  increases. On the one hand, pP65 directly binds to the promoter region of HIF-1α
  to promote the expression of HIF-1α. On the other hand, pP65 can inhibit the expression
  of PHD2, thereby blocking the ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α by PHD2,
  ultimately leading to the accumulation of HIF-1α in cells. HIF-1α can promote glycolysis
  and lead to the activation of PSCs to release cytokines such as CXCL1, thereby chemotactically
  attracting the infiltration of neutrophils and aggravating AP
