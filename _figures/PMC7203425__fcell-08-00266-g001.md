caption: Aerobic glycolysis in photoreceptor functions. Photoreceptors are post-mitotic
  cells, interdigitated with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Glucose enters the
  RPE through choroidal circulation. Bruch’s membrane (BM) separates the RPE and choroid.
  Glucose from the RPE is transported to a photoreceptor through glucose transporter
  1 (Glut1). In photoreceptor cells, the majority of glucose is redirected to anabolic
  processes. Every day by the onset of light, 10% of photoreceptor tips are phagocytosed
  by the RPE, and some of the digested lipids are recycled back to photoreceptor cells.
  A high rate of membrane synthesis takes place in photoreceptor cells. The redirected
  glucose is utilized for the anabolic processes, which include lipid synthesis, RNA/DNA
  synthesis, and protein synthesis. The NADPH generated through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) is used for lipid synthesis and reduction of all-trans-retinal to
  all-trans-retinol by the retinol dehydrogenase 8 (RDH8). NADPH is also needed for
  antioxidant metabolism. Photoreceptor cells express predominantly PKM2, while PKM1
  is a minor protein. Pyruvate formed during glycolysis will be converted to lactate
  by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Lactate is transported to RPE through lactate transporters
  (monocarboxylate transporter), where it converts to pyruvate through LDH to fuel
  mitochondria. Glucose-mediated oxidative phosphorylation is minimal. PKM2 favors
  aerobic glycolysis and has a lower affinity for PEP, which results in the accumulation
  of PEP in the outer segments, which triggers the PPP. BM, Bruch’s membrane; RPE,
  retinal pigment epithelium; OS, outer segment; IS, inner segment; RDH8, retinal
  dehydrogenase 8; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PKM1, M1
