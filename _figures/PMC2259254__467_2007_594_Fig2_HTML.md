caption: The balance between muscle hypertrophy and atrophy depends on whether protein
  synthesis is more active than degradation or vice versa. In protein synthesis, insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF)-1 and insulin signaling leads to increased phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), which promotes Akt phosphorylation (Akt-P). Akt-P promotes phosphorylation
  of GSK1 and mTOR/S6 kinases, leading to increased protein synthesis. Akt-P also
  phosphorylates the forkhead (FoxO) transcription factor, preventing it from entering
  the nucleus to promote expression of atrogin-1, MuRF-1, and other atrogenes, thereby
  blocking protein degradation. In protein degradation, the opposite pathway happens,
  but additionally, decreased Akt-P leads to increased caspase-3 activity, further
  promoting degradation. In inflammation, it is thought that tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF)-α and other inflammatory cytokines phosphorylate the inhibitor of nuclear
  factor (NF)-κB (IκB), to free NF-B to enter the nucleus and promote MuRF-1 expression,
  and ultimately, muscle protein degradation. (Reproduced with permission from [])
