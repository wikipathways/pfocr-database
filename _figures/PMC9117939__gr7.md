caption: Schematic diagram of the phosphorylation mechanism induced by MSCs in lung
  cancer. Ectopic ATP synthase expressed on the cell surface of MSCs secretes extracellular
  ATP into the tumor microenvironment. This extracellular ATP activates P2X7R on lung
  cancer cells and subsequently induces the phospho-ERK1/2–phospho-c-Fos axis. The
  MSCs then contribute to lung cancer development via the promotion of tumor proliferation
  and migration. ERK1/2, extracellular signal–regulated protein kinases 1 and 2; MSC,
  mesenchymal stem cell.
