caption: The MEP and MVA pathways. In the MVA pathway, a series of enzymes catalyze
  two molecules of acetyl-CoA into IPP, which is then isomerized by IDI to its isomer—DMAPP.
  In the MEP pathway, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate are converted to IPP
  and DMAPP. At the same time, IDI as an isomerase, functions to balance the amount
  of IPP and DMAPP. Under the catalysis by the downstream enzymes, DMAPP enters the
  synthesis pathway of the target product
