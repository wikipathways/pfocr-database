caption: The origin of CAFs are complex, diverse, and heterogeneous. CAFs originate
  from a variety of sources, including resident fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial
  cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs), cancer stem cells (CSCs), adipocytes, pericytes, and stellate cells. Each
  origin is associated with distinct signaling pathways
