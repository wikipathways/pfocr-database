caption: Summary of drugs under investigation or with preliminary efficacy in psoriasis
  disease (red), and drugs with no data reporting efficacy (orange). A) The JAK inhibitor
  blocks the JAK-STAT pathway signaling in Th17 cells. Specifically, deucravacitinib
  inhibits TYK2. B) Tapinarof, an AhR agonist, reduces IL-17 and IL-22 in both Th17
  cells and keratinocytes. C) Spesolimab and imsidolimab inhibit IL-36R. D) Imo-8400
  inhibits TLR-7/8/9. E) BAY1834345, ND2110 and ND2158 inhibit IRAK4. F) Piclidenoson
  inhibits A3AR in keratinocytes. G) Ponesimod, a selective S1PR1 agonist, induces
  sequestration of lymphocytes into lymph nodes and decreases peripheral lymphocyte
  counts and tracking of lymphocytes to peripheral tissues. H) Namilumab has not shown
  efficacy in psoriasis. J) PDE4 inhibitors act on lymphocytes. K) Among RORγt, just
  ABVV-157 and AUR-101 have shown efficacy in psoriasis. L) KD025, a ROCK2 inhibitor,
  reduces IL-17 secretion in Th17 cells.
