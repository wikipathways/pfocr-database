caption: Role of aberrant HNF4α-inflammatory signaling in cancer. A regulatory pathway
  involving microRNAs and HNF4α links inflammatory responses (TNFα, IL-6) to hepatocyte
  transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). After induction by stimuli,
  NF-κB and IL-6 inhibit the expression of HNF4α by inducing the expression of miR-21,
  and miR-24, miR-629, respectively. High HNF4α expression inhibits the NF-κB and
  IL-6 pathways by upregulating the expression of miR-7, miR-124 microRNAs. Aberrant
  HNF4α-related NF-κB, STAT3 and IL-6 signaling pathway is involved in tumorigenesis
  and the EMT process.
