caption: Exercise activates a wide variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways
  to promote neurogenesis of granule cells from neuroprogenitors in the dentate gyrus.
  Specifically applicable to neurogenesis, Wnt is released from neighboring astrocytes
  in a paracrine fashion, whereupon exercise increases Wnt signaling. Wnt binds its
  fzl receptor, complexed with LRP, and leading to the activation of Dshi, which,
  in turn, inactivates GSK3. The resulting accumulation of β-catenin (β-cat) in the
  cytoplasm and nucleus then binds to, and displaces, the gene regulatory proteins,
  LEF/TCF and Sox2 and the co-repressor, Groucho. β-Catenin then acts as a co-activator,
  and with transcription factors Prox1 and NeuroD1, stimulates the transcription of
  Wnt target genes. In addition, exercise also lifts the repressive MeCp2, thereby
  enhancing transcription. Normally, in the absence of exercise, Wnt3/3a is sent to
  the noncoding region of the granule cell, where L1 mobile elements are repressed
  during adult neurogenesis. Because L1 sequences contain the Wnt-regulatory element,
  the nearby genes can be indirectly up-regulated when the β-catenin/TCF-LEF complex
  is activated via Wnt signaling. In addition, exercise increases Wnt activity, leading
  to increased presynaptic protein and vesicle clustering, in turn leading to increased
  release of various neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, serotonin). Through a dizzying
  array of receptor and pathway cross-talk, these neurotransmitters, via GPCR signaling,
  can not only directly activate downstream PKA and subsequent transcription factor,
  CREB, thereby leading to the transcription of BDNF and related neurotrophic genes,
  but also activate other trophic factors (IGF-1, VEGF), thereby, in turn, activating
  a variety in intracellular signaling survival pathways (PI-3K, MAPK, CamKII), while
  simultaneously inhibiting apoptosis and inducing eNOS. Thus, both the Wnt regulatory
  element and the cAMP-response element (CRE) may participate (synergistically) to
  promote synaptogenesis, angiogenesis, proliferation, and neurogenesis.
