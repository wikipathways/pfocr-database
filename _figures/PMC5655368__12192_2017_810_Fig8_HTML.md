caption: DENV-NS4B protein regulates the expression of UPR activation-dependent effectors
  through a possible interaction with IRE1. NS4B is one of the proteins with higher
  pro-viral characteristics because it is involved in mechanisms that make viral replication
  more efficient and blocks several of the immune signaling pathways in mammals. We
  hypothesized that NS4B could be regulating the two outputs of the UPR to benefit
  the replication of the virus. Thus, on the one hand, it allows the translation of
  viral proteins and blockade of cell death by apoptosis by decreasing the PERK pathway.
  On the other hand, it decreases the activation of the effectors dependent on XBP1
  splicing
