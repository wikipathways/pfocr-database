caption: 'The roles of PGC-1 in PPCM and DCM. PCG-1α provides cardioprotection against
  PPCM through three mechanisms: 1) activating anti-oxidative enzyme MnSOD that further
  inhibits apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells; 2) triggering the provascular
  VEGF-mediated signaling; and 3) meeting the need of a fuel shift towards FAO driven
  by PPARs. In the condition of DCM, short- and long-term increases in PGC-1α pathway
  inhibit and promote insulin resistance, respectively.'
