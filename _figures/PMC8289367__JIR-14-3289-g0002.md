caption: Effects of m6A on the normal maturation and physiological function of DCs.
  (A) the role of m6A in the maturation of DCs and activation of T cells. The m6A
  modification of Trap transcription factor in DCs promotes the translation of CD40,
  CD80, and TLR4 signals on its membrane surface, which not only activates T cells
  but also enhances the production of cytokines induced by TLR4/NF-κB signals. (B)
  the role of m6A in the migration of mature DCs. Stimulation of CCR7 activates the
  HIF-1α transcription factor pathway in DC. m6A modified lnc-Dpf3 directly binds
  to HIF-1α and inhibits the transcription of HIF-1α-dependent glycolytic gene LDHA,
  thus inhibiting the glycolytic metabolism and migration ability of DCs. (C) m6A
  mediated the antitumor effect of DCs. Transcript Flt3L encoding lysosomal protease
  is labeled with m6A and recognized by YTHDF1, which enhances the translation of
  lysosomal cathepsin in DCs. However, the deletion of YTHDF1 in classical dendritic
  cells leads to its inhibition, which significantly enhances the cross-presentation
  ability of tumor antigen, and makes CD8+T cells highly express PD-L1 and IFN-γ.
