caption: RAS pathway activation and downstream effects in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
  Oncogenic RAS pathway activation is associated with an aggressive tumor biology
  in many solid malignancies and a proliferative phenotype in chronic myelomonocytic
  leukemia (CMML). Accordingly, numerous inhibitors of upstream RAS activators, inactive
  RAS-off states, active RAS-on states, and downstream effectors of RAS signaling
  are in various phases of development. The central panel provides an overview of
  the canonical RAS pathway, wherein post-transcriptional processing of RAS via farnesyl-transferase
  (FTase) and prenylated protein methyltransferase (PPMTase) localize inactive RAS
  to the cell membrane. There, RAS GTP exchange factors (GEF) such as SOS1, SOS2,
  and SHP2 (also known as PTPN11) facilitate the transition from inactive GDP-bound
  RAS-off states to active GTP-bound RASon states. Conversely, as RAS has very weak
  intrinsic GTP hydrolase activity, GTPase-activating proteins (GAP) such as neurofibromin
  1 (NF1) facilitate GTP-to-GDP hydrolysis to deactivate RAS. Active RAS signals through
  RAF, MEK, and ERK family proteins to promote transcription of cell-proliferation
  genes, including CCND1 which encodes cyclin D1. Meanwhile, gain-of-function mutations
  in PTPN11 and loss-of-function mutations in NF1 also serve to augment RAS signaling
  by promoting GEF and impairing GAP function, respectively. Similarly, inactivating
  mutations in CBL, which encodes the ubiquitin ligase responsible for degradation
  of many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), also sustain oncogenic RAS signaling. Additionally,
  RAS activates the non-canonical phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway, which signals
  through AKT and mTORC1 to further promote cyclin D expression and, by extension,
  progression through the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. Collectively, the transcriptional
  activation and cell cycle progression driven by the canonical and non-canonical
  pathways contribute to replication stress and activation of WEE1, which serves to
  inhibit cyclin dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and halt progression through the G2/M checkpoint.
  However, dysregulation of upstream effectors such as aurora kinase A (AURKA) and
  polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) mitigate this checkpoint and permit aberrant cell proliferation.
  The panels along the periphery depict selected agents being developed to target
  the various aspects of oncogenic RAS signaling. Agents interfering with RAS processing
  and initial activation are organized along the top. Direct inhibitors of RAS-off
  and RAS-on states are organized along the left upper edge, while inhibitors of downstream
  effectors RAF, MEK, and ERK are along the left lower edge. Inhibitors of the non-canonical
  PI3K pathway are organized along the right. Finally, inhibitors of the DNA damage
  response pathway and G2/M checkpoint are along the bottom. Agents under investigation
  in CMML specifically are highlighted in dark red
