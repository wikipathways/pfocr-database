caption: 'Models for Agrin/MuSK-mediated NMJ formation: Four distinct models for how
  agrin and MuSK orchestrate the organization of the motor endplate. Our data argue
  strongly against the first, simple, model (A), in which agrin-mediated MuSK kinase
  activation is sufficient to lead to AChR clustering. In the second model (B), MuSK
  kinase activation is not sufficient because agrin independently activates a second,
  distinct, receptor system that is also required for AChR clustering. A variety of
  data, discussed in the text, argue against this model. Although it remains possible
  that MASC provides its own signaling pathway (C), we have no data to support this.
  The model (D) most strongly supported by our data and that of Apel et al. (), indicates
  that in addition to functioning through intracellular pathways activated by the
  MuSK kinase domain, the agrin/MASC/MuSK complex acts extracellularly to help recruit
  and assemble components of the NMJ.'
