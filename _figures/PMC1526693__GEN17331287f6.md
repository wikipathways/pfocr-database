caption: Models for regulation of str-2 expression. (A) In the AWC neurons in adults,
  G-protein-mediated signals from the AWA, ADL, and ADF neurons converge with cell-autonomous
  G-protein signals and the Ca2+/MAPK pathway to regulate str-2 expression. The cells
  in which GPA-3 and GPA-13 function have not been identified, but the AWC neurons
  are likely candidates. (B) In Dauer larvae, signals from the AWA, AWB, ASH, and
  possibly AWC and/or ADF neurons regulate str-2 expression in the ASI neurons. (C)
  A model of the genetic pathway that regulates str-2 expression. The G-protein/Ca2+/MAPK
  network probably signals partially via daf-3. odr-1 is epistatic to the G-protein/Ca2+/MAPK
  network, indicating a parallel or downstream function. The position of osm-9 has
  been extrapolated from its presumed cellular function.
