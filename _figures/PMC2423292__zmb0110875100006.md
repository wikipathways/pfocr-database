caption: Musashi1 signaling in mammary progenitor cell proliferation. Msi1 blocks
  translation of two known targets in mammalian cells, Numb and p21Cip1. The present
  study indicates that Msi1 inhibits DKK3 protein secretion and mRNA levels, but it
  is unknown if this occurs by interference with nuclear processing and/or translation.
  Inhibition of Numb expression increases intracellular Notch and Notch-dependent
  transcription of genes such as the Delta1, Jagged1, Notch1, Hes1, and cyclin D1
  genes. Inhibition of p21Cip1 relieves its inhibitory effect on cyclin D-dependent
  protein kinases to increase G1/S transit through the cell cycle. Loss of DKK3 expression
  activates the Wnt pathway, resulting in increased nuclear localization of β-catenin
  and transcription of β-catenin/TCF-dependent target genes such as the cyclin D1
  and D2 and PLF1 genes, and possibly the Msi1 gene itself. PLF1 activates ERK, presumably
  through the IGF2R, which in turn inhibits GSK3β to further increase activation of
  the Notch and Wnt pathways through an autoregulatory loop. The net result of these
  processes is the stimulation of mammary progenitor cell proliferation. Dashed lines
  indicate inhibition; solid lines indicate stimulation.
