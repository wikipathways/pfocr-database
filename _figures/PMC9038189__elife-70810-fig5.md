caption: (A) In wild type testes, EGF ligands (red circles) are secreted by germ cells
  and received by cyst lineage cells. The EGFR pathway is repressed in hub cells by
  the secreted inhibitor Argos (yellow squares), which sequesters EGF ligands, and
  by intrinsic pathway inhibitors (Sprouty and PTEN). Hub quiescence and identity
  are maintained. (B) After genetic ablation of all CySCs and early cyst lineage cells,
  EGF ligands are no longer sequestered by Argos and are received by the hub. The
  EGFR pathway is activated in hub cells, driving expression of the downstream transcription
  factor Pointed and its target genes, resulting in hub cell proliferation and conversion
  to CySCs. As new CySCs are generated, Argos is once again expressed, down-regulating
  EGFR signaling in the hub.
