caption: The proposed mechanism of short-chain fatty acids to prevent cytokine storm
  and multi-organ failure. (1) SARS-CoV-2 enters and colonizes the host organism mainly
  through the airways. (2) Intestinal dysbiosis is found in patients with severe forms
  of COVID-19. Lymphocytopenia is also observed and SARS-CoV-2 inhibits regulatory
  T cells and leads to activation of the NF-κB signalling pathway which promotes the
  cytokine storm. (3) Supplementation with butyrate could help to limit the cytokine
  storm through the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway and promotion of anti-inflammatory
  M2 macrophages. Moreover, butyrate could restrain the thrombo-inflammation phenomenon
  by activating the t-PA. Created with Biorender.com.
