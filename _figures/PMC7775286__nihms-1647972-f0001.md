caption: The activating and inhibitory receptors regulate NK cell responses. NKp46,
  NKp44, NKp30, NKG2C/CD94, KIRs with short cytoplasmic tail (KIR-S), KIR2DL4, and
  NKG2D are known to transduce activating signals. Each activating receptor utilizes
  Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activating Motif (ITAM)-bearing (CD3ζ, FcRγ, or DAP12)
  or non-bearing (DAP10) adaptor proteins for signal transduction summarized in the
  figure. Upon recognition of their ligands, CD3ζ, FcRγ, DAP10 and DAP12 are phosphorylated.
  Syk and ZAP70 are activated by the phosphorylation of ITAM-bearing signaling adaptors.
  Syk and ZAP70 then phosphorylates transmembrane (LAT) and cytosolic (SLP76) adaptor
  molecules, which activates other kinases and signaling molecules such as ERK, JNK,
  PLCγ, Vav-2 and Vav-3. NKG2D transduces ITAM-independent pathway, where engagement
  of NKG2D phosphorylates DAP10, and subsequently activates PLCγ2, Vav-1, and NFκB.
  Conversely, NKG2A/CD94 and KIRs with long intracellular domain (KIR-L) provide inhibitory
  signals. The signaling is initiated by the phosphorylation of Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based
  Inhibitory Motif (ITIM) domain of the inhibitory receptors, which recruits phosphatases
  including SHP-1. CD3ζ, FcRγ, or DAP12 are dephosphorylated by phosphatases, which
  deactivates Syk and ZAP70. 2B4 signaling could be either activating or inhibitory
  depending on the level of SLAM-associated protein (SAP). When SAP is expressed,
  SAP binds to Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Switch Motif (ITSM) domain of 2B4 upon
  recognition of its ligands, and recruits Fyn. Syk/ZAP70 phosphorylation is enhanced
  by Fyn, thereby increasing activating signals. In the absence of SAP, however, 2B4
  recruits phosphatases and inhibitory kinases such as SHIP-1, which diminishes ITAM-based
  signaling. Therapeutic approaches to improve NK cell responses include blockade
  of KIR-Ls, and NKG2A signaling targeting reduction of inhibitory signals. Another
  strategy is to use small molecules to modulate intracellular activating or inhibitory
  signals such as ZAP70 activators or phosphatase inhibitors.
