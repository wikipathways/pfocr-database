caption: Proposed model for the effects of GSK3β inhibitors on HCV virion particles’
  assembly/release. GSK3β is an important kinase that is capable of phosphorylating
  a few hundreds of proteins, including SREBP-1 and acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSL3)
  which are involved in lipid metabolic pathways, . The phosphorylated (inactive)
  form is downstream the canonical Wnt pathway, which is stimulated by various signals/stimuli,
  as well as the p38 protein and AKT. The adherence of HCV virion assembly to the
  host cell’s lipid metabolism and secretory pathways renders it sensitive to lipid
  perturbations. The effect of GSK3β enzymes and transcription factors involved in
  lipid metabolism hinders the assembly/release of HCV LVPs (potential mechanism 1).
  GSK3b is also a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase CMGC family. Members of this
  family were shown to be involved in the phosphorylation of HCV non-structural protein
  5A (NS5A), which is an integral part of the HCV replication complex. Similarly,
  GSK3β inhibitors may interfere with this process, representing another potential
  mechanism for inhibition of HCV (potential mechanism 2). *The diagram is a schematic
  drawing and is not proportionate to the real dimensions.
