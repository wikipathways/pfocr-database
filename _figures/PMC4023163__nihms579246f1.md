caption: Oncogene Induced Senescence (OIS) can initially be driven an activating mutation
  in Ras oncogene and eventual amplification of activated Ras signal. Mutated Ras
  then induces OIS through the cooperation of the MapK signaling cascade, the DNA
  damage response pathway and the SASP response. Activation of the MapK cascade leads
  to p38 activation through a series of phosphorylation events, which then activates
  MapKap Kinase 3 (3pK), which in turn phosphorylates Bmi1. This phosphorylation,
  along with chromatin modifications within the Ink4a locus, releases Bmi11 from the
  Ink4a locus allowing transcription of p16Ink4a and p19Arf. Upregulation of p16Ink4a
  proteins leads to SAHF formation and therefore repression of E2F target genes. Additionally,
  amplification of the activated Ras signal leads to the generation of Reactive Oxygen
  Species (ROS) and replication stress thereby engaging the DNA Damage Response. This
  response may promote senescence directly though up-regulation p53 in a direct manner,
  or through the activation of the SASP response. In addition, the DNA Damage Response
  also contributes to senescence through p53. For details and references, see corresponding
  section in the text.
