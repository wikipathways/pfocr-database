caption: Na誰ve (red nuclei) IgM+ and IgG1+ B cells (generated using nuclear transfer-IgG1-ES
  mice) each respond weakly to challenge by antigen and produce few plasma cells (green
  nuclei), resulting in limited amounts of specific antibodies. In contrast, antigen-experienced
  IgG1+ memory B cells (CD38+; blue nucleus) generate plasma cells more efficiently.
  The authors demonstrate that this is due, in part, to reduced amounts of the transcription
  factor Bach2 following priming of na誰ve IgG1+ cells by antigen. Bach2 is not down-regulated
  similarly in IgM+ memory B cells (not shown). The reduction of Bach2 involves mTOR,
  which is activated as part of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, and Foxo1 (not
  shown). Bach2 represses expression of Blimp-1 (encoded by Prdm1), the master regulator
  of plasma cell differentiation. In the presence of reduced Bach2, Prdm1 promoters
  are likely poised (hatched arrow) for activation by signals emanating from antigen
  engagement of membrane IgG1 and other, yet unidentified cues. Together, these mechanisms
  turn on Blimp-1 and the plasma cell program.
