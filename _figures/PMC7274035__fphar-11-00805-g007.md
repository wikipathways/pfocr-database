caption: Schematic diagram representing the important role of GLP-1R/cAMP/Epac/PI3K/Akt
  cascade on inhibition of MG-induced oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial
  dysfunction. In H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, exendin-4 binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R)
  leads to G protein coupling and subsequently causes the stimulation of AC activity
  through Gαs protein, which increases the intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP directly
  binds to Epac, and subsequently induces Epac/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which in
  turn inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction induced
  by methylglyoxal (MG).
