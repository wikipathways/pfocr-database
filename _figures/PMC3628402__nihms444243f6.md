caption: We have identified SRSF1 as a critical component of the RP-MDM2 complex,
  which is formed in response to induction of ribosomal stress. Sequestration of the
  E3 ligase MDM2 in this complex results in decreased ubiquitylation and increased
  stability of the tumor-supressor p53 protein. Moreover, we have identified and characterized
  an anti-tumorigenic response that primary cells mount in response to overexpression
  of the SRSF1 oncoprotein, which triggers the formation of a nuclear ternary SRSF1-RPL5-MDM2
  complex, leading to activation of the p53-mediated tumor-suppressive pathway and
  OIS.
