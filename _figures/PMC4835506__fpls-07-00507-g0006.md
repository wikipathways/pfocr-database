caption: 'Schematic representation of root metabolic network. The metabolic pathway
  involved in time-dependent response of root cultures to the stress condition are
  shown in gray boxes: the upward arrows indicate a positive regulation and the downward
  arrows a negative regulation of metabolic pathways as well as the significantly
  increase and the decrease in metabolite levels. The white arrows indicate the metabolic
  variations depending on the culture time; the black arrows indicate the metabolic
  variations depending on the chitosan treatment. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; BCAA,
  branched-chain aminoacids; DMAPP, dimethylallyl-pyrophosphate.'
