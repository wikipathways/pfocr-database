caption: Multiple mechanisms of acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance have been identified.
  BRAF V600E melanoma cells chronically treated with BRAF inhibitors acquire drug
  resistance via switching between the three isoforms of RAF (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) to
  activate the MAPK pathway. Increased IGFR1 and PDGFR signaling may also allow for
  resistance by activating PI3K/AKT signaling as well as other pathways. Resistance
  can also arise following the reactivation of the MAPK pathway, this can occur following
  the acquisition of activating mutations in NRAS (Q61K) and MEK (C121S) and the increased
  expression of the MAP3K8 (COT).
