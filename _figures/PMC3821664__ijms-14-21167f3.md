caption: The utilization of long chain fatty acids for de novo phospholipid biosynthesis
  (Kennedy pathway, red arrows and boxes), post-synthetic modification of phospholipids
  by reacylation (Lands’ cycle, green arrow), and the metabolism of phospholipids
  to oxidized lipid mediators of inflammation (orange arrow and box) in critical cells
  during inflammatory responses, such as vascular endothelial cells and mononuclear
  leukocytes. Origins of fatty acid substrate addressed in this review are (solid
  blue arrows and boxes) adipose triacylglycerol-derived fatty acid 1, fatty acid
  synthesized de novo2, recently absorbed dietary fatty acid 3, and phospholipid-derived
  fatty acid, cleaved by phospholipases then recycled for phospholipid biosynthesis
  4 (broken blue arrow).
