caption: The boolean network model of the cholesterol regulatory pathway. (A) A network
  diagram of the model. All incoming connections into a node constitute AND logic
  except for cholesterol that has OR logic. A connection ending with a bar indicates
  NOT logic. The cholesterol synthesis pathway is shown from the precursor Acetyl-CoA
  to the final product cholesterol including feedback from cholesterol to SREBP-SCAP.
  Statins inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, and regulates the synthesis of cholesterol.
  After evaluating the specificity of each regulation to the statins perturbation,
  statins perturbation-specific regulations were colored with red. (B) A heat map
  of key intermediate products in the process of synthesizing cholesterol from Acetyl-CoA,
  together with the status of statins and HMG-CoA reductase. All 200 samples (100
  without statins and 100 with statins) are shown.
