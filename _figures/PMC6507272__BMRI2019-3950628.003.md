caption: The role and expression of proteins identified by proteomic analysis within
  NAD+ metabolism and signaling pathway. Red (green) rectangle represents proteins
  upregulated (downregulated) in IBD. Red (green) rectangle with red pentagram represents
  proteins upregulated (downregulated) in IBD with p value < 0.05. Yellow rectangle
  represents proteins that are unchanged between IBD and controls. Gray rectangle
  represents proteins undetected by proteomic analysis.
