caption: The sketch represents the impact of nano-encapsulated tea polyphenols impact
  poultry health. Nanoencapsulation boosts the bioavailability, stability, absorption,
  and solubility of tea polyphenols, making them more effective when administered
  through feed. In the liver, these polyphenols activate the NrF2/ARE pathway, upregulating
  key antioxidant enzymes like SOD, GSH-px, GSH, CAT, GPX1, and GPX4, while lowering
  MDA levels. In the intestines, tea polyphenols affect the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway,
  enhancing the production of IL-18 and TNF-α, which play a role in immune response
  regulation. Advantages of these bioactive compounds are further amplified by their
  incorporation into nutraceuticals and bioactive feed packages, thus potentially
  boosting overall health and resistance to oxidative stress
