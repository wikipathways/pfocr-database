caption: Schematic of TLR signaling pathways. TLR2 (in combination with TLR1 or TLR6)
  and TLR4 utilize MyD88 and TIRAP/MAL as primary adaptors to activate NF-κB and inflammatory
  cytokine secretion. Also, TLR4 uses TRIF and the TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM)
  to activate IRF3 and the IFN pathway. TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 typically localize to
  endocytic compartments, where they detect a variety of nucleic acids and activate
  the IFN pathway. TLR3 utilizes TRIF, but not TRAM, to activate IRF3. TLRs 7, 8,
  and 9 trigger inflammatory cytokine secretion and the IFN pathway through MyD88.
  Other than MyD88, the signaling intermediates utilized by TLRs 7, 8, and 9 to activate
  IFN responses remain undefined.
