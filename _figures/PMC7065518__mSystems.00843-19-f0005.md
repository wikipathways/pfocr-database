caption: Working model for metabolic outcomes resulting from 5,10-mTHF limitation.
  2AA-dependent damage of GlyA in a ridA mutant of S. enterica causes a glycine/5,10-mTHF
  limitation. The 5,10-mTHF limitation leads to a downstream decrease in CoA, altering
  flux through CoA-dependent mixed acid fermentation. In this working model, accumulated
  pyruvate is rerouted toward branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis. The metabolites
  on the left side of the cell schematic are altered by an unknown, but glycine/5,10-mTHF-dependent,
  mechanism. Metabolites colored blue are elevated in the wild type, and those colored
  red are elevated in the ridA mutant. The purple pathway represents the effect of
  supplemented glycine in restoring endogenous glycine/5,10-mTHF levels. Metabolites
  that are boldfaced and italicized were not detected by 1H NMR. Compounds listed
  outside the rounded rectangle represent metabolites detected by 1H NMR in the growth
  medium.
