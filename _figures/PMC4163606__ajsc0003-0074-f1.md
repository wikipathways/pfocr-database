caption: 'LIF signaling and post-translational modifications of some stemness transcription
  factors. The maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency in mESC is controlled
  by extrinsic signaling pathway (LIF) and intrinsic self-renewal factors (eg: Oct4,
  Sox2 and Nanog). LIF binds to its heterodimeric receptor which leads to the activation
  of receptor associated Janus kinases (JAKs) which phosphorylate receptor docking
  sites and Stat3 on tyrosine 705 (Tyr705). Then, dimers of Phospho-Stat3 translocate
  to the nucleus and activate the transcription of target genes that are essential
  for ES cell self-renewal (eg: Klf4, Klf5 which induces expression of Mras GTPase).
  The activated Stat3 leads also to expression of its own repressor like Socs3, which
  serves as a negative feedback signal. Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination, SUMOylation
  and Acetylation of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog control protein activity, expression, and
  stability, which result in modulation of ESC self-renewal activity. S stands for
  “stabilization” of the protein. Arrow indicates “activation” while the line indicates
  “repression”.'
