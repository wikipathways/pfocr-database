caption: Putative mechanisms underlying the protection of dopaminergic substantia
  nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurones following group III metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)
  receptor activation. Activation of group III mGlu receptors located at three different
  sites in the glutamatergic subthalamonigral synapse may underlie the protection
  of dopaminergic SNc neurones. (i) Activation of pre-synaptic mGlu4 or mGlu7 receptors
  will restrict the pre-synaptic Ca2+ entry required for glutamate release leading
  in turn to reduced synaptic glutamate levels and reduced stimulation of post-synaptic
  NMDA receptors. The resultant reduction in Ca2+ entry into SNc neurones is proposed
  to reduce excitotoxic damage. (ii) Activation of glial mGlu4, 7 or 8 receptors may
  lead, via activation of MAP kinase or elevation of the antioxidant reduced glutathione
  (GSH) levels, to increased glutamate uptake via GLT-1 or GLAST glutamate transporters,
  further reducing synaptic glutamate levels. Activation of glial receptors may also
  reduce the production of inflammatory mediators, such as chemokines, that in turn
  will reduce the inflammatory stress upon SNc neurones. (iii) Activation of mGlu4
  or mGlu8 receptors on SNc neurones directly may lead to increased microtubule stabilization
  through a MAP kinase-dependent pathway. One or more of these events may contribute
  to the overall neuroprotective effects of group III mGlu receptor activation. G,
  glutamate; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
