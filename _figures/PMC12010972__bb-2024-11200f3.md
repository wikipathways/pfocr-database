caption: 'Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors. Inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway
  mainly include sclerostin, DKK1, WIF1, and SFRPs. These proteins are composed of
  varying amounts of amino acids and primarily inhibit the conduction of the Wnt signaling
  pathway by binding to the ligand cell membrane Frizzled (FZD) receptor and low-density
  LRP5/6 of the Wnt signaling pathway. DKK1: Dickkopf-1; LRP5/6: Lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 5/6; WIF1: WNT inhibitory factor 1'
