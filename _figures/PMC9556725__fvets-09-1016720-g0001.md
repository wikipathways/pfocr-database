caption: 'Neurobiology of pain in laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus). The nociceptive
  pathway consists of 5 phases that are necessary to perceive pain. 1. Transduction:
  the transformation of a harmful stimulus into an electrical signal (or action potential)
  through the action of peripheral receptors (BR2, ASIC3, TRPV1, TrkA) that are activated
  by inflammatory mediators from mast cells, platelets, macrophages, and tissue damage.
  2. Transmission: the action potentials are transmitted to the spinal cord laminae
  via first-order neurons (marked in blue) where they synapse with second-order neurons
  (marked in green). Laminae I, II, and V receive nociceptive input from Aδ and C
  fibers. 3. Modulation: the response to harmful stimuli in the inhibitory and excitatory
  interneurons of the spinal cord can increase or be inhibited depending on the participation
  of mediators such as SP, BDNF, CGRP, GLU, and ASP and their action on the membrane
  receptors of the postsynaptic neurons. 4. Projection: second-order neurons project
  the electrical signal to supraspinal centers through, for example, the spinothalamic
  tract, which is considered the most important for nociception. 5. Perception: once
  the signal reaches the higher brain centers, the thalamus connects with neurons
  in regions like the somatosensory cortex, where the conscious perception of pain
  and the consequent physiological, endocrine, and behavioral changes in rodents take
  place. AMPA: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; ASIC3, acid-sensitive
