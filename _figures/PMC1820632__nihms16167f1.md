caption: Selected cytokines and their signal transduction pathways are depicted in
  simplified fashion to illustrate representative interactions between cytokine and
  glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling events. Cortisol binds to GR, resulting in
  dissociation of heat shock protein (HSP) complexes and subsequent phosphorylation.
  GR then translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes and either interacts with
  other transcription factors, or binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs)
  upstream of GR-regulated genes (e.g. inhibitor κ-B or IκB). TNF-alpha binds to its
  receptor and results in activation of IκB kinase β (IKKβ), which phosphorylates
  IκB, allowing NF-κB (shown here as p65 and p50 Rel subunits) to translocate to the
  nucleus. Through protein-protein interactions, activated NF-κB associates with GR,
  thus interfering with GR-DNA-binding. IL-1 binds to its receptor initiating a) mitogen
  activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MKK)4/7, which culminates in activation
  of Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), b) MKK3/6, which culminates in activation of
  p38, and c) Ras, which results in activation of the extracellular signal-related
  kinase (Erk)1/2. Of note, MKK4/7 activation of JNK can also occur through TNF-alpha
  receptor binding. As depicted by the dotted lines, both p38 and JNK can phosphorylate
  key GR residues, thereby disrupting nuclear translocation of GR. Interferon (IFN)-α
  binds to its receptor resulting in Janus kinase (Jak) phosphorylation, represented
  as Jak1 and tyrosine kinase (Tyk)2. Jak1 phosphorylates signal transducers and activators
  of transcription (STAT) proteins, including STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. Tyk2 can also
  activate elements of the Ras signaling pathway, resulting in activation of Erk1/2.
  Activated STATs translocate to the nucleus, where they can interact with GR through
  protein-protein interactions, thereby interfering with GR DNA-binding. Phospholipids
  are hydrolyzed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to form arachidonic acid which is metabolized
  by cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 to produce prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Stimulation of serotonergic
  receptors 4, 6, or 7 (5-HT4, 6, 7) and beta adrenergic receptors (β1) induces a
  conformational change in G stimulatory (Gs) protein, which then activates adenylyl
  cyclase (AC). AC, in turn, converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP then induces a conformational changes in protein kinase
  A (PKA), which translocates to the nucleus where it is able to enhance GR DNA-binding.
  In addition, the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) interacts with p65, thereby inhibiting
  NF-κB nuclear translocation.
