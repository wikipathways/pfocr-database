caption: Leptin and insulin signaling in SF1 neurons. Leptin binds LEPR to regulate
  body weight gain, energy expenditure, and insulin sensitivity in the VMH via STAT3
  phosphorylation which is translocated into the nucleus and induces the expression
  of genes such as SOCS3, a negative regulator of LEPR. Leptin also stimulates a PI3K-dependent
  pathway, particularly involving subunits p110α, which contributes to energy expenditure
  regulation, and p110β, which contributes to both brown fat thermogenesis and glucose
  metabolism regulation in SF1 neurons. The Gsα subunit of G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCR) of hormones and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) negatively regulates
  leptin action. The activation of this leptin signaling pathway triggers protection
  against obesity and diabetes under a high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. According to insulin
  signaling in SF1 neurons, exposure to HFD drives hyperinsulinemia, insulin binds
  insulin receptor (IR), which in turn activates PI3K that indirectly phosphorylates
  FOXO1 to induce transcription factors and promote obesity and glucose metabolism
  disruption.
