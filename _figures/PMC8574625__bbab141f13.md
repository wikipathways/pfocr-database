caption: Schematic visualization of the complementary network for the 12 KEGG pathways,
  which are indicated in circular nodes, and the 7 complementary nodes shown in diamond
  shape. The orange nodes represent nodes that are also part of the four common ND
  pathways and purple nodes are hub–bottleneck nodes that act as a bridge of communication
  between nodes/pathways in the MS disease KEGG pathways network. The green nodes
  are complementary nodes, which are not MS disease-related pathway terms (MS unique,
  MS shared or NDs common).
