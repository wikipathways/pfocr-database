caption: A model for cholinergic input induction of dauer recovery. In dauer pheromone
  or in a daf-7 mutant, the DAF-7 TGF-β ligand is not produced by the ASI sensory/secretory
  neuron. Therefore, there is no activation of the DAF-1 and DAF-4 TGF-β receptors
  or downstream DAF-8 and DAF-14 Smad proteins, and this results in high DAF-3 Smad
  activity in signaling cells or target tissues. In pheromone without muscarinic agonists,
  no insulin-like signal is released, causing less insulin receptor signal transduction
  to the transcription factor DAF-16, which, in combination with unregulated DAF-3,
  induces dauer arrest. Under pheromone-induced or daf-7 mutation-induced dauer induction
  conditions, muscarinic stimulation causes release of an insulin-like DAF-2 ligand,
  which stimulates the DAF-2/AGE-1-signaling pathway to DAF-16 inactivation. Because
  daf-7 mutants can recover in muscarinic agonists, the TGF-β signaling pathway is
  not required for dauer recovery. Under normal conditions of dauer recovery upon
  release from pheromone and addition of food and low temperature, we suggest that
  acetylcholine released via temperature or food pathways binds to the muscarinic
  receptor on the insulin-like signaling cell to cause an increase in insulin release.
  We suggest that temperature is coupled via the interneurons AIY and AIZ to the DAF-2
  insulin-like signaling pathway rather than the TGF-β signaling pathway because mutations
  in the thermoregulatory gene ttx-3 can suppress mutations in daf-7 and not mutations
  in daf-2 (ref. ; O. Hobert and G.R., unpublished observations).
