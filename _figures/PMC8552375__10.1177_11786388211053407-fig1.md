caption: 'A diagram of post-exogenous pyruvate metabolic profile with NAD+ and senolytics
  in healthy aging. Administration of NAD+ and its precursors (NMN, NA, NR) increases
  NAD+ levels in tissues; senolytics inhibit cellular senescence. Exogenous pyruvate
  with cytosolic [H+] reduces to lactic acid (lactate + [H+]) by LDH, coupled NADH
  oxidation, increasing NAD+/NADH ratio and preserving glycolysis at G-3-PD step;
  pyruvate also inhibits the sorbitol pathway by declining AR activity, decreasing
  NAD+ consumption and restores the pentose phosphate pathway in cytosol, raising
  GSH/GSSG ratio. In addition, exogenous pyruvate stimulates PDH as well as PC activities
  and promotes the TCA cycle via the regulation with PDK and PDP besides the HIF-1-EPO
  pathway stimulation. NADH via the electron transport chain converts back to NAD+ + [H+]
  and produces ATP in mitochondria. Alternatively, exogenous pyruvate enhances energy
  metabolism and thus inhibits cellular senescence in addition to NAD+ restoration.,Abbreviations:
  [H+], hydrogen consumed; [H+], hydrogen produced; AR, aldose reductase; G-3-PD,
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GSH/GSSG, glutathione (reduced/oxidized
  form); HIF-1/EPO, hypoxia inducible factor-1/erythropoietin pathway; LDH, lactate
  dehydrogenase; NA, niacin; NAD+/NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (oxidized/reduced
  form); NAM, nicotinamide; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; NR, nicotinamide riboside;
