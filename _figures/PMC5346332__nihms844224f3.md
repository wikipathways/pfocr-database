caption: 'Role of Aim2 protein in non lupus-prone and lupus-prone strains of mice
  in the regulation of type I IFNs production. Left panel: Bone marrow-derived macrophages
  (BMDMs) from non lupus-prone strains of mice such as C57BL/6 express higher levels
  of Aim2 protein as compared with p202 protein. Upon sensing cytosolic DNA, the Aim2
  protein in BMDMs activates the Aim2 inflammasome, resulting in activation of caspase-1,
  proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, and secretion of mature IL-1β and
  IL-18. Additionally, activation of caspase-1 also results in cell death by pyroptosis,
  which prevents the production of type I IFNs through activation of the STING-TBK1-IRF3
  pathway (see ). Right panel: BMDMs from lupus-prone strains of mice such as (NZB
  x NZW)F1 express reduced levels of Aim2 protein as compared with p202 protein. Upon
  sensing cytosolic DNA, cytosolic DNA sensors such as cGAS or p202 activate the STING-TBK1-IRF3
  pathway, resulting in an increased expression of type I IFNs and activation of a
  robust type I IFN response. Accordingly, BMDMs from Aim2-deficient mice produced
  higher constitutive levels of IFN-β and activated a type I IFN response []. Similarly,
  BMDMs from Aim2 heterozygous or Aim2-deficient mice activated a type I IFN response
  and increased p202 protein levels.'
