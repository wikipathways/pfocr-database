caption: Hypothetical illustration of the mechanism involved in the protective effect
  of carnosine in preventing zinc-induced neuronal death. Zn2+ is secreted from presynaptic
  vesicles into the synaptic cleft during ischaemia. Excess Zn2+ translocates into
  the cell and can cause a disruption in Ca2+ homeostasis; mitochondrial energy failure;
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER); oxidative stress; and, consequently, apoptotic neuronal
  death. The co-exposure of Cu2+, which is secreted with Zn2+ during ischaemia, potentiates
  these effects. Zn2+ chelators (Ca-EDTA), Ca2+ channel blockers (Al3+ and nimodipine),
  energy substrates (pyruvate and citrate), the SAPK/JNK signalling pathway inhibitor
  (SP600125), and antioxidants (HSA-Trx) inhibit these pathways. Carnosine (Car) inhibits
  the ER-stress-related, Ca2+-related gene (Arc)-related apoptotic, and reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) pathways. Carnosine is secreted from glial cells in response to glutamate
  and Zn2+ stimulation and protects neurons from Zn2+ neurotoxicity. The solid and
  dotted lines in the figure represent the movement of substances and the pathways
  of cell death, respectively
