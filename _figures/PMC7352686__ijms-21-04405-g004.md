caption: The mevalonate and the fatty acid synthesis pathways. Acetyl-CoA, derived
  from glucose, glutamine, or citrate following its export to the cytosol, is converted
  through the mevalonate pathway into several metabolites including cholesterol and
  coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 transfers electrons from complexes I and II of the electron
  transport chain, as well as from dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), to complex
  III. Acetyl-coA also acts a precursor for fatty acid synthesis, through its conversion
  to malonyl-CoA, and then to palmitate. The mevalonate pathway is represented in
  yellow boxes. The fatty acid synthesis pathway is represented in blue boxes. Dashed
  arrows represent multiple steps. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA; IPP, isopentenyl-diphosphate;
  FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle.
