caption: 'Representation of the role of Lar in the niche to maintain lymph gland homeostasis.
  (A) In the early instar lymph gland, absence of Lar in the niche ensures insulin
  signaling-mediated proliferation. (B) Known players: insulin signaling and Dpp-Wg
  signaling activate the Myc (Dmyc) circuit relevant for niche cell proliferation
  and niche function. The signaling pathway is upregulated as a result of the niche-mediated
  immune response during wasp infection. (B′) Post second instar, the appearance and
  subsequent increase in Lar expression curtails insulin signaling to restrict proliferation.
  Thus, the increase in insulin signaling due to Lar downregulation led to proliferation
  in the niche cell number along with an accumulation of ROS. The high levels of ROS
  in the niche ectopically induce JNK, bolstering the proliferation. High ROS also
  feeds into the known pathway that is activated only during infection. Here, Spitz
  from the niche upregulates phosphorylated ERK in MZ, which results in ectopic differentiation
  along with lamellocyte production. Loss of Lar engages this pathway developmentally
  in the absence of infection.'
