caption: CO upregulates mitochondria biogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis. (A)
  HO/CO–NOS/NO crosstalk may play beneficial roles in ECs through cellular communications.
  (B) In normoxic astrocytes, the HO-1/CO pathway upregulates HIF-1α protein level
  by translational facilitation through PI3K-Akt and MEK-Erk1/2 and protein stability
  through HIF-1α-Hsp90 binding. In contrast, HO-1-mediated BR and CO production can
  induce LTCC activation, and consequent Ca2+ influx triggers the AMPKα-NAMPT–SIRT1–PGC-1α
  signaling cascade. CO also increases Akt-dependent PGC-1α activation, NRF1/2 expression,
  and TFAM upregulation. PGC-1α-ERRα-mediated mitochondrial biogenic activation transiently
  induces hypoxia (enhanced O2 consumption) and HIF-1α stabilization. (C) HO-1/CO
  pathway-mediated HIF-1α stabilization transcriptionally expresses its putative target
  genes, such as ERRα, VEGF, SDF-1a, NAMPT, eNOS, and iNOS, which are related to mitochondria
  biogenesis, angiogenesis, neovascularization, neurogenesis, vascular tone, and inflammation.
