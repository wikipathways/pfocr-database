caption: 'The PGR operates via multiple signaling pathways within the cell. Canonical
  progesterone signaling requires the presence of progesterone ligand and the release
  of the PGR by chaperone proteins. Upon release and binding of progesterone ligand,
  the dimerized PGR enters the nucleus and binds to response elements within promoter
  regions and governs the recruitment of transcription coregulators. This genomic
  signaling method is the slowest of the progesterone signaling mechanisms. The PGR
  can also function in a non-genomic context through the binding of SH3-domain containing
  proteins such as Src kinase on specific membrane receptors. The binding of the PGR
  to Src kinase elicits rapid activation of the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway within the cell.
  Also, progesterone receptors integrated into the membrane were found to elicit rapid
  activation of cellular signaling pathways upon binding of extracellular ligand.
  Abbreviations: P4, progesterone; PGR, progesterone receptor; CoR, coregulator; TF,
