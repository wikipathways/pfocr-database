caption: Major components of FGF and HH signaling pathways. A. The FGF receptor is
  a single transmembrane domain molecule with an extracellular ligand binding domain
  (containing three immunoglobulin-like domains, I, II, III) and an intracellular
  tyrosine kinase domain (TK). FGF ligands interact with immunoglobulin domains I
  and II. Immunoglobulin domain III is alternatively spliced to encode b and c forms
  that bind mesenchymal and epithelial FGF ligands, respectively. Heparan sulfate,
  in the form of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, serves as a cofactor for FGF binding
  and receptor activation. Dimerization of the FGF receptor leads to activation of
  downstream signaling pathways and regulation of target genes. B. The HH receptor,
  Ptc1, functions to inhibit the multi transmembrane domain protein, Smo, in the absence
  of ligand. C. In the presence of HH ligand, the inhibitory action of Ptc1 is repressed
  allowing Smo to activate downstream signaling pathways that ultimately activate
  Gli transcription factors. Among the targets of the HH signaling pathway are Ptc1
  and Gli1.
