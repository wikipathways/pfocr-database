caption: 'YAP/TAZ signaling pathway in the tumor microenvironment. YAP/TAZ coactivators
  interact simultaneously with different elements of the TME causing (A) EMT during
  neoplastic progression. After the coupling of YAP/TAZ with the TEAD (A1), the complex
  is activated, and it induces the expression of target genes (A2) that promote the
  transition from the epithelial phenotype to the mesenchymal phenotype. (B) Angiogenesis.
  The presence of VEGF (B1) stimulates the activation of TAZ (B2) and the subsequent
  expression of genes (B3) that promote sustained angiogenesis of the blood vessels
  in the TME (B4). (C) Metabolic reprogramming. YAP/TAZ activation and the formation
  of the YAP/TAZ/TEAD complex (C1) promotes the expression of target genes that allow
  the cancer cell to acquire new metabolic pathways needed for its adaptation to the
  TME (C2). (D) Mechanotransduction. During tumor progression, the EMC adopts a rigid
  conformation (D1). YAP/TAZ act as sensors that detect EMC changes due to adhesion
  molecules (D2), promoting modifications in TME properties and intrinsic changes
  in tumor cells that allow them to survive in these conditions (D3). (E) Immunomodulation.
  When YAP/TAZ interact with immune cells (E1), they induce changes in the antitumoral
  phenotype of these cells promoting immune evasion, which leads to neoplastic progress
  (E2). YAP: Yes-associated protein; TAZ: Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding
  motif; TME: Tumor Microenvironment, VEGF: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, EMT:
  Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, EMC: Extracellular Matrix, TAMs: Tumor-Associated
  Macrophages, TEAD: Transcriptional enhanced associate domain.'
