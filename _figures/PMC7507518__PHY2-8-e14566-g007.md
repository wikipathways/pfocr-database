caption: Depiction of potential humoral mechanisms that may contribute to SnPP‐mediated
  cytoresistance. In addition to activating the Nrf2 pathway (denoted by asterisks)
  SnPP activates IL‐10 in spleen and IL‐6/TGF beta 1 in liver (as assessed by their
  mRNAs). Elevations in their plasma concentrations leads to renal filtration and
  “organ cross talk”. This allows for these cytoprotective cytokines to contribute
  to Nrf2’s cytoprotective activities
papertitle: The NRF2 stimulating agent, tin protoporphyrin, activates protective cytokine
  pathways in healthy human subjects and in patients with chronic kidney disease.
