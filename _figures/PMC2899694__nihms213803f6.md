caption: A typical receptor-kinase signaling complex illustrated by the aspartate
  receptor. The transmembrane receptor provides the architectural framework of the
  super-molecular signaling complex (, , , , ). Most of the chemosensory pathway components
  are associated with this complex, either stably or transiently. The kinetically
  stable core ternary complex is composed of the dimeric receptor (illustrated as
  a collection of helices), the coupling protein CheW, and the dimeric histidine kinase
  CheA. Other components are believed to be in rapid equilibrium between bound and
  soluble forms, including periplasmic binding proteins, the methyltransferase CheR,
  the methylesterase CheB, and the motor response regulator CheY.
