caption: 'Glucose 6-P either proceeds through glycolysis (participated by FBA, TPI,
  PGM and ENO) or the PPP (participated by TK) to produce pyruvate, which is converted
  to acetyl-CoA, entering the TCA cycle and producing citrate and malate (participated
  by Aco3). atp1 belongs to mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase generates ATP from
  ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane. Glutamine and other
  amino acids also feed by the TCA cycle; for example, α-ketoglutarate can converte
  glutamate, which is converted to glutamine by GS; malate can be converted oxaloacetate,
  which is coverted to aspartate through AST. Abbreviation: HK, hexokinase; PGI, phosphateisomerase;
