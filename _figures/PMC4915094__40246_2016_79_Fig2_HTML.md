caption: The alternative complement pathway and the formation of the C3 convertase.
  In the AP, the generation of C3b can occur by either spontaneous hydrolysis of C3
  (“tick-over” allowing for continuous low-level activation) or by plasma proteolytic
  cleavage all allowing for immediate C3b deposition. C3b forms the C3 convertase
  upon binding to FB and cleavage by FD resulting in an amplification loop producing
  additional C3b to stimulate a large immune response. C3b additionally binds to the
  C3 convertase leading to the formation of the C5 convertase initiating the terminal
  pathway and the establishment of the MAC. This figure was prepared using Servier
