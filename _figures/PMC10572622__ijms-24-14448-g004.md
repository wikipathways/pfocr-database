caption: Representation of Fatty Acids’ and TAGs’ biosynthetic pathway in olive fruits.
  For each enzymatic step, rectangular boxes outlined in green and red indicate up-
  and down-regulated genes in ‘Ruveia’ vs. ‘Salella’ comparison, respectively. Heat
  map of transcript expression for each DEG was reported. The green and red dots indicate
  the metabolites more and less accumulated in ‘Ruveia respect to ‘Salella’, respectively.
  Fold Change (FC).
