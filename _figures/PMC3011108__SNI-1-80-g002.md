caption: Schematic showing another inflammatory pathway that is activated by tissue
  injury. This is the NF-kB activation, in which once the protein is free as a result
  of tissue injury, it can enter the cell nucleus and activate the DNA to enhance
  the inflammatory response further by the production of additional cytokines, chemokines,
  and adhesion molecules (IKKB = IkB kinase)
