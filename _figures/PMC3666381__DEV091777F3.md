caption: Metabolism in differentiating embryonic stem cells. (A) Glycolytic flux and
  lactate production drop rapidly upon embryonic stem cell differentiation. (B) Flux
  into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) decreases as a result. (C) O2 consumption
  increases sharply as the electron transport chain (ETC) again becomes coupled to
  ATP synthase to fulfill the needs of cell differentiation. (D) Glycolysis also becomes
  more coupled to the Krebs cycle, as pyruvate is transported more efficiently into
  mitochondria. (E) Increased ETC activity leads to increased reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and eicosanoid signaling, which promote cell differentiation. Ac-CoA, acetyl
  coenzyme A; HK, hexokinase; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; LDHA,
  lactate dehydrogenase A; OAA, oxaloacetate; Ox Phos, oxidative phosphorylation;

  isomerase.
