caption: Engineering bacteria for nanoparticle synthesis utilizes native pathways
  for metal reduction. (A) Using techniques from synthetic biology, bacteria have
  been engineered to express genes related to nanoparticle formation, including redox
  enzymes, electron transfer pathways, and biomolecules that control the nucleation
  and growth of nanoparticles. Examples of native bacterial metal reduction pathways
  are shown in (B, C). (B) The arsenic reduction pathways in Shewanella sp. ANA-3
  include both cytosolic and periplasmic redox enzymes. (C) The Mtr Pathway from Shewanella
  oneidensis is used for extracellular electron transport. Electrons from metabolic
  processes in the cell are passed through CymA on the IM to periplasmic electron
  shuttles and leave the cell through the Mtr cytochrome complex in the OM. From the
  Mtr complex, electrons move to extracellular electron acceptors, including redox
  shuttle molecules, such as flavins and metals. IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane.
