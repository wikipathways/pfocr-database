caption: Pathways activated by soluble TNFα (sTNFα) and transmembrane TNFα (tmTNFα)
  upon binding to TNFRs. Downstream signaling via TNFR1 is most effective upon high-affinity
  (+++) binding to sTNFα. In the case of TNFR1, this can lead to caspase8/3-mediated
  apoptosis through signaling via its death domain (DD), recruitment of TRADD, and
  subsequent recruitment of FADD or TRAF2. The latter could also result in activation
  of pro-inflammatory signals via the "classical NF-κB" pathway, and is primarily
  activated via TNFR1 (red arrows). Upon high-affinity (+++) binding of tmTNFα to
  TNFR2, TRAF2 is triggered, which preferentially results in NF-κB activation via
  the alternative pathway (blue arrows) to activate the expression of proliferation
  and survival related genes. Both sTNFα and tmTNFα bind with low-affinity (+) to
  TNFR2 and TNFR1 respectively. TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), responsible for
  the conversion of sTNFα from tmTNFα and of soluble TNFRs []. For completeness, the
  alternative TNFR ligand lymphotoxin alpha 3 (LTα3), with its affinity binding profile
  to TNFR1 and 2, is depicted as well. This figure was created with BioRender.com
