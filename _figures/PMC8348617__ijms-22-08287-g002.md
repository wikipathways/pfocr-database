caption: Integration of senescence signals and stress signals in the DCD/NRP-mediated
  cell death response. Leaf senescence, ER stress, and osmotic stress induce the expression
  of GmERD15, which upregulates GmNRPs to initiate a signaling cascade that culminates
  in the induction of GmNAC030 and GmNAC081 expression. The NAC transcription factors
  form a heterodimer to fully induce VPE promoter activation, leading to VPE expression
  and subsequent execution of a cell death program. The phytohormones positively regulate
  the signaling pathway, and the ER-resident molecular chaperone BiP acts as a negative
  regulator of cell death by modulating the expression and activity of the cell death
  pathway components. This DCD/NRP-mediated cell death signaling is conserved in other
  plant species, and the Arabidopsis orthologs are shown at the bottom of the figure.
