caption: 'Diagram showing the different molecular mechanisms of non-canonical NLRP3
  inflammasome activations. Left panel: Non-canonical caspase-8-dependent NLRP3 activation.
  TLR4 stimulation by PAMPs and/or DAMPs activates RIP1–FADD-caspase-8 intracellular
  signaling, which, besides promoting the NF-kB transcription step, can activate directly
  canonical NLRP3 oligomerization and assembly. In addition, fungi PAMPS (i.e., Candida
  albicans, fungal cell wall component β-glucans, and mycobacteria), via dectin-1
  stimulation, can promote IL-1β transcription as well as the formation and activation
  of a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1)–caspase-8–
  adaptor protein (ASC) complex, which contributes to processing and release of IL-1β.
  Right panel: Non-canonical caspase-11-dependent NLRP3 activation. In the first step,
  Gram-negative bacteria activate the TLR4–MyD88 and tumor necrosis factor receptor
  (TRIF) pathways, with consequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which promotes
  the transcription of IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3 as well as interferon regulatory factor
  (IRF)-3 and IRF7 genes. The IRF3–IRF7 complex (1) elicits the expression of IFN-α/β
  (2) that binds the interferon (IFN)-α/β receptor 1 IFNAR1/IFNAR2 receptor (3), leading
  to activation of the janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (JAK/STAT) pathway (4) and transcription of caspase-11 gene (5). In the second step,
  unidentified scaffold proteins or receptors induced by Gram-negative bacteria cleave
  and activate caspase-11, which induces pyroptosis as well as high-mobility group
  box 1 (HMGB1) and IL-1α release, and promotes the activation of NLRP3–ASC–caspase-1
  pathway. Caspase-1 activation promotes also pyroptosis and HMGB1 release.'
