caption: Proposed mechanism(s) underlying the improvement of endothelium‐dependent
  vasodilation after Roux‐en‐Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Higher circulating glucagon‐like
  peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) after RYGB activates the endothelial GLP‐1 receptor and downstream
  protein kinase A (PKA), which inhibits c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK) 2. JNK2 directly
  inhibits endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and insulin receptor substrate‐1 (IRS‐1)
  in the insulin signaling pathway; PKA and IRS‐1 lead to protein kinase B (Akt) activation,
  which then directly stimulates eNOS. This, in turn, leads to improved NO bioavailability
  and vasodilation. In parallel, JNK2 inactivation inhibits reduced nicotinamide ADP
  (NADPH) oxidase activity and decreases the levels of superoxide anions, which further
  contributes to preserved NO bioavailability and vasodilation. These beneficial effects
  of RYGB were mimicked by in vivo pharmacological JNK inhibition. Blue and red arrows
  indicate experimentally observed activation and inactivation, respectively, of proposed
  downstream mediators. D‐JNK indicates peptide inhibitor D‐JNKi‐1; and p, phosphorylated.
