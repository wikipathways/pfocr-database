caption: Mechanism of FIR in preserving pancreatic β-Cell mass and function. The figure
  illustrates the proposed mechanism by which far-infrared radiation protects pancreatic
  β-cells from dysfunction and apoptosis. FIR stimulates mitochondrial activity, leading
  to an increased ATP/ADP ratio and a higher NAD+/NADH level, which subsequently activates
  Sirt1. Sirt1 enhances insulin secretion and promotes cell survival through the activation
  of PLZF and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, reducing apoptosis. Additionally, FIR
  influences intracellular calcium (Ca2+) dynamics, further supporting insulin secretion
  and β-cell function. These mechanisms collectively contribute to the maintenance
  of β-cell mass and function under metabolic stress
