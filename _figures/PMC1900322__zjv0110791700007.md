caption: Model for induction of KSHV reactivation by metabolic end products from gram-negative
  bacteria, which contain high levels of butyric acid, inhibit cellular HDACs, and
  activate the p38 kinase pathway. Activation of the p38 pathway may lead to phosphorylation
  of cellular histones, which results in increased sensitivity to acetylation by histone
  acetyltransferases. The combined effects of HDAC inhibition and increased acetylation
  sensitivity result in hyperacetylation of the histones on immediate early viral
  promoters. The acetylation event neutralizes the positive charge of the histone
  tail and remodels chromatin structure, making the nucleosome accessible for binding
  to transcription factors and activation of the temporal cascade of viral gene expression
  and subsequent viral production. Viral genes are denoted as E (early), IE (immediate
  early), and L (late). MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
  protein kinase kinase; SB, SB202190; PD, PD169316.
