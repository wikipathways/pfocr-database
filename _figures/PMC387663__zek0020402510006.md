caption: Proposed structure and processing of WT and ConA 1-1 OSLs. After formation
  of WT OSL (containing Man9GlcNAc2) (A) and ConA 1-1 OSL (containing Man7GlcNAc2)
  (B), glycans are transferred to EP-procyclins. Whereas the WT glycan is efficiently
  transferred to procyclins, those from mutants are only partially transferred, forming
  underglycosylated proteins. Subsequently, all the α1-2Man residues are removed from
  glycans by specific mannosidases, forming procyclins bearing Man5GlcNAc2 (WT) or
  Man4GlcNAc2 (ConA 1-1). Whereas WT glycans are not further processed, most glycans
  in ConA 1-1 EP-procyclins are modified to hybrid types by the addition of an N-acetyllactosamine
  group to the terminal α1-3Man residue. *, Man residue in WT whose transfer is defective
  in ConA 1-1. “(+/−)” indicates that some procyclin glycosylation sites are unmodified
  in ConA 1-1 cells.
