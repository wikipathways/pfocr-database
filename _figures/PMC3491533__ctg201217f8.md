caption: Diagrammatic presentation shows how Notch and TGF-β signaling pathway involved
  at each pathogenic stage of HBV infection. Signaling gene sets were activated in
  periphery of acute HBV (AVH-B)-infected patients, which were attenuated during the
  chronic stage of infection and again activated during cirrhosis and end stage of
  liver disease.
