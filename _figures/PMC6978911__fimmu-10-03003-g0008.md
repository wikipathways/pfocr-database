caption: Schematic comparison between CiTLR22a- and CiTLR22b-mediated signaling pathways.
  Both CiTLR22a and CiTLR22b localize to lysosome, recognize dsRNA, and recruit MyD88
  adaptor molecule. CiTLR22a inhibits IRAK3 expression, enhances the protein and phosphorylation
  levels of IRF7, and facilitates the IFN and NF-κB pathways. However, CiTLR22b promotes
  IRAK3 expression, inhibits the phosphorylation level of IRF7 and protein level of
  IRF3, and plays a negative role in initiating the IFN and NF-κB pathways.
