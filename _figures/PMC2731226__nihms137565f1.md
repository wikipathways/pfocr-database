caption: '(A) Penicillin. The modular portion of the penicillin pathway is shown;
  each circle or oval represents a separate protein domain, and the domains are organized
  into three modules (red, blue, and green). These modules comprise a single ten-domain
  protein, isopenicillin N synthetase. The logic of penicillin synthesis is similar
  to that of protein synthesis by the ribosome: each newly-arrived building block
  gets linked to its module and then bonded to the nascent peptide chain attached
  to the upstream module. Bond formation translocates the chain to the downstream
  module. 1) α-aminoadipate, a nonproteinogenic amino acid, is selected and activated
  by the blue module. 2) The activated form of α-aminoadipate is loaded onto the carrier
  domain of the blue module. 3) Cysteine is selected and activated by the red module.
  4) Cysteine is linked to the red module and then coupled to the α-aminoadipate linked
  to the blue module, forming a peptide bond and translocating the chain to the red
  module. 5) Valine is selected and activated by the green module. 6) Valine is linked
  to the green module and then coupled to the α-aminoadipate-cysteine dipeptide linked
  to the red module, forming a new peptide bond and translocating the chain to the
  green module. 7) The chain is released from the green module. Post-assembly modifications
  convert the penicillin precursor into penicillin N. (B) Tetracyline. The enzymes
  in the early part of the tetracycline pathway are distant homologs of fatty acid
  synthase (FAS); like FAS, they iteratively couple C2 building blocks (colored red,
  green, and blue) to synthesize a long chain. By omitting the beta-carbon reduction
  and subsequent steps, the tetracycline pathway produces a polyketone chain rather
  than a saturated lipid chain. Three enzymes control the cyclization of the polyketone
  chain into a precursor with four fused rings, and post-assembly modifications convert
  the precursor into tetracycline. (C) Streptomycin. Three different sets of enzymes
  convert the primary metabolite glucose-6-phosphate into the three building blocks
  of streptomycin, colored blue, red, and green. Two coupling enzymes related to sugar-coupling
  enzymes from primary metabolic pathways link these building blocks, and post-assembly
  modifications turn the nascent trisaccharide into streptomycin. (D) Thiocillin.
  The last fourteen amino acids of a 52-residue peptide undergo thirteen post-translational
  modifications – including cleavage of the 38-residue ‘leader peptide’ – to become
  thiocillin. Only a single residue – a threonine (shown in black in the lower left-hand
  portion of the molecule) – remains unmodified.'
