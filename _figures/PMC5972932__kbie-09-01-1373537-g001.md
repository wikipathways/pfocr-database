caption: Folic acid biosynthetic pathway in plants illustrating key catalysts involved
  at different steps. These catalysts are primarily required for the production of
  pterins and p-ABA in the plant cell. The pterins are produced in the cytoplasm by
  purine metabolism and carried to mitochondria, whereas the p-ABA branch is initiated
  in plastids through shikimate pathway and subsequently p-ABA is transported to mitochondria
  for the production of folic acid in association with pterins. Certain folic acid
  rate-determining catalysts such as DHNA (folB) and DHPS (folP) are known for the
  regulation of folic acid production in the cell mainly through potential feedback
  regulation.
