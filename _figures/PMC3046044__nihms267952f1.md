caption: 'Overview of the molecular mechanisms involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
  (NPC) development. NPC development begins with the upregulation of pathways that
  promote cellular proliferation: Akt pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases (JNK,
  ERK), Wnt pathway, and EGFR signaling. Subsequent increases of transcription factors
  such as NF-κB and β-catenin lead to cellular proliferation via cell cycle dysregulation
  (high c-myc, cyclin D1, and cyclin E expression) and inhibition of tumor suppressors
  (p16, p27, and wild-type p53). In addition, cell adhesion abilities are compromised
  because of low E-cadherin levels and high expression of MMPs. Also, antiapoptotic
  mechanisms such as bcl-2, survivin, and telomerase are upregulated., Stimulatory
  effect; , inhibitory effect; orange color indicates apoptosis regulators; light
  blue color indicates cell adhesion proteins; yellow color indicates cell cycle regulators;
  dark blue color indicates proliferative pathways; green color indicates transcription
  factors; purple color indicates tumor suppressors; EGFR, epidermal growth factor
