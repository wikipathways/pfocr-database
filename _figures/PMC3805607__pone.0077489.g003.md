caption: A. 103 shared genes were regulated in the same direction in the nephritic
  vs. prenephritic kidneys in NZW/BXSB and NZB/W mouse models. The picture shows the
  72 that were co-cited in the same sentence of PubMed abstracts. B. 240 genes were
  regulated in the same direction in the nephritic vs. prenephritic kidneys in NZB/W
  and NZM2410 mouse models. The picture shows the 124 genes that were co-cited in
  PubMed abstracts in the same sentence. Orange represents the genes that are upregulated
  and green represents the genes that are downregulated in nephritic compared to prenephritic
  mice.
