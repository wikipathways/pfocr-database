caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the possible interplay between the EGFR
  and CK2 signaling pathways that regulate GBM cell proliferation. An attached “P”
  indicates phosphorylation. PD-L1 - programmed death-ligand 1, EGFR - epidermal growth
  factor receptor, heat shock protein 90 - Hsp90, Cdc37 - co-chaperone of Hsp90, Akt
  - a serine/threonine protein kinase, CK2 - protein kinase CK2, NICD - intracellular
  domain of the Notch receptor, PTEN - tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, Gli1
  - glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (zinc finger protein). Nestin and c-Myc are
  cancer stem cell markers important for glioma invasion. Catenins are cell-cell adhesion
  proteins; β-catenin also regulates transcription and is part of the Wnt signaling
  pathway that regulates cell proliferation and migration.
