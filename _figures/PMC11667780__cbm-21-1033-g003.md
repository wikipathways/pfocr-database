caption: The mechanisms underlying mTOR regulation in macrophage differentiation.
  TLRs on macrophages activate mTORC1 via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Once activated,
  mTORC1 inhibits PI3K/AKT activity to prevent mTORC1 hyperactivation. Additionally,
  PI3K/AKT activates mTORC2 via the TSC1/TSC2 complex. Activated mTORC1 serves as
  a peripheral sensor for oxygen, amino acids, and glucose and functions as a peripheral
  sensor for oxygen and glucose. Under sufficient oxygen and nutrient levels, mTORC1
  and mTORC2 upregulate HIF-1α and glycolysis, thereby driving M0 macrophage differentiation
  toward the M1 phenotype. In contrast, under oxygen and nutrient deficiency mTORC1
  and mTORC2 upregulate FAO and OXPHOS processes, thereby facilitating the differentiation
  of M0 macrophages into the M2 phenotype. mTORis modulate macrophage differentiation
  within the tumor immune microenvironment, influencing immune responses and potentially
  affecting tumor progression via this mechanism. mTORC2, mechanistic target of rapamycin
  complex 2; TLR, toll-like receptor; TSC1, tuberous sclerosis complex 1; TSC2, tuberous
  sclerosis complex 2; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; FAO,

  protein kinase-interacting protein 1
