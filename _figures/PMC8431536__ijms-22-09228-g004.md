caption: Dysregulated gene expression networks in lung and blood with COVID-19. (A,B)
  show pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity in lung
  and blood DCs separately. Each node in network is a pie plot showing three comparisons,
  including mild vs healthy (top right), severe vs healthy (bottom), and severe vs
  mild (top left). Node size corresponds to the number of genes in dataset within
  the pathway. Color intensity inner the node corresponds to the significance of the
  pathway for this dataset (red is for positive effect; blue is for negative effect,
  darker indicates larger effects). Orange outer circles show the overlapping pathways
  found in lung and blood DCs, while blue outer circles show the uniquely detected
  pathways. Edge weight corresponds to the number of genes found in both connected
  pathways. Venn diagrams show the distribution of genes with more than 2 folds alterations
  which were detected from above three comparisons in each dataset. (C) shows STRING
  networks of changed genes in lung DCs in severe COVID-19 cases compared to healthy
  (left) and mild cases (right). The intensity of filling color corresponds to the
  log2 fold-of-change of the gene expression (red is for positive effect; blue is
  for negative effect).
