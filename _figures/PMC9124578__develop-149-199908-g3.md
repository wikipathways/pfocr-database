caption: 'Osteoclast specification. (A) Osteoclast (OCL) fusion and maturation. The
  osteoclast fusion consists of sequential steps: (1) migration, (2) partner recognition,
  (3) adhesion and (4) fusion. Osteoclast progenitor cells reside in the bone marrow
  cavity proximal to vascular networks. Single-nucleated osteoclast precursors (shown
  with purple, orange and red nuclei) migrate from the bone marrow cavity to sites
  of resorption on the bone surface. Osteoclast progenitors selectively recognize
  their fusion partners, followed by cell-cell fusion and maturation. (B) Osteoclast-osteoblast-osteocyte
  interactions. Osteoblasts (OBs), osteocytes (OCs) and osteoclasts directly communicate
  each other through either cell-to-cell interaction or paracrine signaling molecules.
  Osteoblasts secrete M-CSF, RANKL and WNT5A to promote osteoclast differentiation.
  OPG, SEMA3A and WNT16 secreted by osteoblasts inhibit osteoclast differentiation.
  SEMA4D suppresses osteoblast differentiation. Osteocytes regulate the balance of
  bone formation and resorption by secreting RANKL/OPG. SOST from osteocytes interacts
  with LRP5/6 and suppresses preosteoblast differentiation via inhibitory effects
  on the WNT/β-catenin pathway. RANK-enriched vesicles secreted from osteoclasts can
  increase bone formation by triggering RANKL reverse signaling. HSC, hematopoietic
  stem cell.'
