caption: 'Representation of the Ethylene Signaling Cascade Including XRN4/EIN5.Ethylene
  is perceived by the ETHYLENE RESPONSE (ETR/ERS) receptors located in the endoplasmic
  reticulum membrane. Binding of ethylene to the receptors results in the inactivation
  of both the receptors and CTR1, thereby causing the derepression of positive regulatory
  factors, such as EIN2 (data not shown) and XRN4/EIN5. How CTR1 regulates EIN2 and
  XRN4/EIN5 and the relationship of EIN2 with XRN4/EIN5 in the ethylene signaling
  cascade are unknown. Strikingly, our model proposes the existence of two degradation
  pathways in ethylene signaling: one RNA decay pathway into the cytosol that indirectly
  controls the steady state levels of EBF1/2 mRNAs, which are components of a protein
  degradation pathway that controls EIN3 stability in the nucleus.'
