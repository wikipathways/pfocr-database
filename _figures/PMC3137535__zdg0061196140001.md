caption: 'A: schematic diagram of the closed-loop respiratory control system. Plant
  represents the gas-exchange dynamics of the lung. Inputs to the plant are the gas
  tensions in mixed pulmonary capillary blood as well as the level of ventilation

  the aggregate response of the respiratory pattern generator (RPG) to its inputs
  (including chemoreceptor outputs, wakefulness drive, etc.). Disturbance term w1
  represents random fluctuations in ventilation, for instance, as a by-product of
  noisy neural signal transmission from RPG, variations in upper airway/lung compartment
  resistance and elastance, variations in the wakefulness drive, and higher cortical
  inputs (8, 36 44). Disturbance term w2 signifies other factors influencing fluctuations
  in the blood gases, such as changes in metabolic rate, cardiac output, etc. Frequency-dependent
  product of the plant and the controller gains is known as the loop gain of the system.

  involving the CO2-specific chemoreflexes, responding to fluctuations in PaCO2 by
  a (frequency dependent) proportional change in minute ventilation; TV̇e→Pco2 likewise
  specifies the action of CO2 exchange in the lung compartment. Similarly, TV̇e→Po2
  and TPo2→V̇e specify the feedforward and feedback components of the O2-specific
  loop. All modeled variables are subject to their own source of fluctuation (indicated
  by the wiggly arrows). In appendix a, we show that each transfer path block is completely
  determined by the autoregressive coefficients in .'
