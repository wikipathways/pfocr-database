caption: Ca2+-dependent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
  pathway and of the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT). VEGF binding to VEGFR2
  triggers an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that may stimulate the
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation cascade or NFAT nuclear translocation. VEGF-induced endothelial
  Ca2+ signals may be mediated by multiple Ca2+-entry/release pathways, depending
  on species and vascular bed. The Ca2+response to VEGF may recruit the Ca2+-dependent
  PKCβ2 (cPKCβ2), which engages the downstream RAF1–MEK–ERK1/2 cascade to induce gene
  expression. An increase in [Ca2+]i is required to promote cPKCβ2 translocation to
  the plasma membrane, where it is activated by DAG. Moreover, VEGF-induced endothelial
  Ca2+ signals may be sensed by calmodulin (CaM), which in turn activates calcineurin
  to dephosphorylate NFAT, thereby inducing its nuclear translocation. See ,  (ERK)
  and  (calcineurin and NFAT) for further details.
