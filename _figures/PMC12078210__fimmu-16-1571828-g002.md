caption: Pathways of Allogeneic Antigen Recognition and the Impact of IL-21 on DCs.
  From top to bottom, the figure shows the pathways of direct recognition, indirect
  recognition, and semi-direct recognition. On the one hand, IL-21 inhibits DC maturation
  by reducing the expression of surface co-stimulatory molecules such as CD86 and
  CD40 (not shown in the figure). On the other hand, IL-21 maintains the expression
  of CCR7 on DCs, enabling them to migrate to secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs). The
