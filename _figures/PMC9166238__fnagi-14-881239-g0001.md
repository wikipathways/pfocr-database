caption: Summary of mitochondrial events and general autophagic events under ApoE4
  intervention. (A) After excessive cellular stress, mitochondria begin to swell and
  fragment into healthy mitochondria for fusion, and pre-degraded mitochondria for
  mitophagy. damaged mitochondria induce PINK1/Parkin pathways and then participate
  in general autophagic flux. ApoE4 is directly or indirectly involved in mitochondrial
  events, including DRP1 pathways during fission; the MFNs pathways during fusion;
  and the PINK1/Parkin pathways during mitophagic induction. (B) After excessive cellular
  stress, the omegasome is initiated to form an elongated into a phagophore, which
  encloses the damaged mitochondria and becomes a mature autophagosome. Lysosomes
  recruit to autophagosome and fuse with it to form autolysosome, the ultimate area
  of mitochondrial degradation. ApoE4 intervenes autophagic initiation by the mTOR,
  TFEB, and SIRT1 pathways; compromises elongation by LC3, p62, and Rab5 pathways;
  blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion by the Rab7, LAMP2, and LAMP1 pathways; damages
  lysosomal degradation by CTSD and V-ATPase pathway.
