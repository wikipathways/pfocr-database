caption: miRNA dysregulation in cancer. A schematic representation depicting the canonical
  miRNA biogenesis pathway and the general mechanisms whereby normal miRNA expression
  and function can be dysregulated in cancer. (a) Dysregulation of miRNA gene transcription
  in cancer through genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional mechanisms. Active transcription
  is indicated by green arrow and blocked transcription by red block arrow. Red crosses
  indicate loss of the gene, epigenetic mechanism, or transcription factor. Me, methylation;
  Ac, acetylation. (b) Simplified canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis and processing.
  Steps commonly dysregulated in cancer are indicated in red. (c) Mechanisms are prevalent
  in cancer allowing mRNAs to escape regulation by miRNAs. RBP, RNA binding protein.
