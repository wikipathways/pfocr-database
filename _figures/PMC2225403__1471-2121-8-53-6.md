caption: 'Possible signaling pathway for carbachol-induced pigment granule dispersion
  in bluegill RPE. In conjunction with previous evidence, a pathway that follows carbachol
  and forskolin (FSK) treatment is proposed. Arrows in red represent the pathway involved
  in dispersion; whereas, black arrows represent the aggregation pathway. All of the
  mediators shown have been tested with the exception of calmodulin, which may be
  required for calcineurin activation [28]. The specific phosphorylated/dephosphorylated
  substrate(s) is(are) unknown. Abbreviations used are as follows (listed alphabetically):
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; Ca2+i, intracellular free calcium ions; cAMPi, intracellular
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; DAG, diacylglycerol; FSK, forskolin; Gαq, alpha
  subunit of the Gq family of GTP-binding proteins; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; Modd,
  muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 1, 3, or 5; PIP2, phosphatidyl inositol
  bisphosphate;PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase;PLC, phospholipase C.'
