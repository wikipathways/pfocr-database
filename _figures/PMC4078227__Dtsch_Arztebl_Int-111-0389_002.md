caption: Hedgehog signal pathway. While the hedgehog signal pathway is important in
  embryogenesis, it is usually inactivated in adult cells. The figure shows mutations
  (red border) which can lead to the activation of the hedgehog pathway in a basal
  cell carcinoma and inhibitors (gray border) which can block the pathway. PTCH, patched;
  SMO, smoothened; SHH, sonic hedgehog; SUFU, suppressor of fused; Gli, Gli transcription
  factors (modified from [27])
