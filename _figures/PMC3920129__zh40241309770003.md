caption: TLR ligands/DAMPs, cellular location, and signaling in the vasculature. Evolutionarily
  conserved similarities between TLRs on immune cells have been extended to somatic
  cells of the vasculature (i.e., VSMCs and ECs). TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6
  are expressed on the plasma membrane, and TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are expressed
  on endosomal vacuoles. Activation of these receptors by DAMPs and PAMPs leads to
  complex cellular signaling cascades mediated by myeloid differentiation primary
  response protein (MyD88), Toll-IL-1 receptor (TIR)-domain-containing adaptor inducing
  interferon β (TRIF), TIR domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), and TRIF-related
  adaptor molecule (TRAM). These adaptor molecules signal via MyD88-dependent or MyD88-independent
  pathways that result in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (cytokines,
  chemokines, and adhesion molecules). The MyD88-dependent pathway includes NF-κB
  translocation to the nucleus to regulate inflammatory gene expression. TLR signaling
  activates the endogenous NF-κB inhibitor IKK complex, which phosphorylates IκB and
  leads to its ubiquitylation and degradation by the proteasome. IκB degradation relieves
  the inhibitory influence on NF-κB, and NF-κB is then able to translocate from the
  cytoplasm into the nucleus. MAPK regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators is also
  MyD88 dependent. The MAPK module contains at least 3 protein kinases in series that
  culminate in the activation of a multifunctional MAPK (ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38).
  These MAPKs subsequently result in the activation of the transcription factor activator
  protein (AP-1), which then translocates to the nucleus. Interferon regulatory factor
  (IRF)7 is also MyD88 dependent, but is only found downstream of TLR9. Phosphorylation
  and dimerization of IRF7 activate its translocation to the nucleus. The MyD88-independent(/TRIF-dependent)
  pathway downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 involves IRF3, as well as NF-κB activation.
  Like IRF7, IRF3 undergoes phosphorylation and dimerization for activation and translocation
  to the nucleus. dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; HSP, heat shock protein; mHDL, (pathophysiologically)
  modified HDL; ssRNA, single stranded RNA.
