caption: Shows the role of tumor-associated mast cells and their mediators (histamine,
  VEGF, and TNF-α) within the TME as well as the proposed mechanism of the anti-tumor
  effect of Cimetidine/Vitamin C by modulating mast cells mediators resulting in the
  restoring of oxidative stress balance, inhibition of angiogenesis and inactivation
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway leading to cancer cells apoptosis. TAMC tumour associated
  mast cell, TME tumour microenviroment, ROS reactive oxygen species, H2R histamine
  receptor 2, VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor, TNF-α tumour necrosis factor
  alpha, cAMP cyclic adenosine monophosphate, PKA protein kinase A, IRS-1 insulin
  receptor substrate-1, PI3K phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, AKT serine/threonine kinase-1,
  m-TOR mammalian target of rapamycin.
