caption: 'Complement pathway. Genes up-regulated in pregnant dairy cows are shaded
  red. The complement system is part of the innate immune response and can be activated
  in three ways: classical pathway, alternative pathway and lectin pathway, all of
  which converge at the level of C3 convertase. The Classical pathway begins with
  activation of the C1 complex (6xC1q, 2xC1r and 2xC1s) through the binding of C1q
  to antigen bound antibodies (IgG or IgM) or directly to the surface of a pathogen.
  Binding causes a conformational change in C1q which leads to activation of C1r and
  C1s (serine proteases), this leads to cleavage of C4 and C2. The cleavage products
  of C4 and C2 form C3 convertase cleaves C3, leading to the formation of C5 convertase
  that cleaves C5 and results in formation of the membrane attack complex[].'
