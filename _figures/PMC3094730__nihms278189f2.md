caption: (A) TLR-ERK-mediated induction of retinoic acid metabolizing enzymes and
  IL-10. Activation of DCs through TLR2/6 ligands leads to ERK activation, which mediates
  induction of Raldh2. Thisresults in the conversion of retinal to retinoic acid (RA),
  which then exerts an autocrine effect on DCsvia RAR or RXR to induce SOSC3. This
  thensuppresses activation of p38 MAPK and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore,
  IL-10 and RA programDCs to induce T-regulatory cell responses and limit theinflammatory
  responses. (B) β-catenin signaling pathways in programming regulatory DCs. Activation
  of β-catenin pathway by E-cadherine, TLRs, or wnt-ligands in DCs promotes induction
  of anti-inflammatory factors such vitamin A, IL-10, and TGF-β that are critical
  for promoting T-regulatory cell response and limiting inflammatory responses.
