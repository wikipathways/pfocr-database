caption: Potential action network of predicted targets of miRNAs overexpressed in
  GML mice stomachs. The five overexpressed miRNAs (in yellow) inhibit the expression
  of various targets such as TP53INP1. Activation of a signaling pathway is represented
  by blue arrows and inhibition by red arrows. Validated targets are in yellow and
  non-validated targets in gray.
