caption: 'The Math1 signalling pathway. (A) Low power section of adult mouse small
  intestine. Precursor cells (brown) are stained for cyclin PCNA (proliferating cell
  nuclear antigen); enterocytes (red) express intestinal alkaline phosphatase; goblet
  cells (blue) secrete mucins. The inset shows a high power image of small intestinal
  enterocytes and goblet cells. (B) Math1, a component of the Notch signalling pathway,
  influences intestinal epithelial cell fate decisions. In crypt progenitor stem cells
  that express high levels of Notch, the Hes1 transcription factor is switched on
  and expression of Math1 and of other “prosecretory” genes is blocked. The result
  is that the precursor cells become enterocytes. In cells expressing low amounts
  of Notch, levels of Delta are high, production of Hes1 is blocked, and Math1 expression
  is induced. Production of the Math1 helix-loop-helix transcription factor allows
  precursor cells to make a choice: whether to become goblet cells, Paneth cells,
  or enteroendocrine cells (Vi, villus; Cr, crypt) (A and B from van Den Brink and
  colleagues with permission). (C) Math1 is essential for secretory cells. Whether
  Math1 expressing cells descend directly from stem cells or an intermediate progenitor
  remains unknown. Sec, secretin; L, glucagon/peptide YY; CCK, cholecystokinin; SP,
  substance P; 5HT, serotonin; Som, somatostatin; GIP, gastric inhibitory peptide;
