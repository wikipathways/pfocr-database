caption: Multifaceted roles of PRC1 in cancer. (A) The c-Myc protein leads to increased
  PCGF4 (BMI-1) expression and promotes the transcription repression of target genes
  p19ARF and p16 repressed at the Ink4a/ARF locus, promoting the proliferation of
  cancer cells. In contrast, PCGF2 (MEL-18) plays a tumor suppressor role by inhibiting
  the transcription of c-Myc. (B) PTMs of PRC1 subunits can promote tumorigenesis.
  Deposition of O-GlcNAcylation on BMI-1 improves its protein stability and inhibits
  its degradation. Increased levels of BMI-1 protein enhance transcriptional silencing
  of downstream target genes such as p53, p16, and PTEN, thereby promoting cancer
  cell proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis. (C) PRC1 may also be involved
  in tumorigenesis and development in a PRC2-independent manner. Interestingly, PRC1
  is also found on specific targets that lack the H3K27me3 mark, and these gene loci
  deposit active marks such as H3K27ac and H3K4me3. The PRC1 subunits PCGF1, PCGF3,
  and PCGF6 were reported to activate related mechanisms such as PI3K/Akt pathway,
  EMT, proliferation, and metastasis, thus promoting tumorigenesis. (D) The catalytic
  subunit of PRC1, RING1B, promotes tumorigenesis through a dual role of gene repression
  and activation. It promotes cell proliferation and metastasis by activating the
  transcription of genes such as CCND2 and ZEB2. Meanwhile, it can also promote cell
  proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by inhibiting the transcription of genes
  such as LTBP2 and E-cadherin. (E) Overexpression of MEL-18 has been found to play
  a tumor suppressor role in a variety of cancers. MEL-18 negatively regulates cancer
  cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis by inhibiting the expression
  of genes such as cyclin D1, Jagged-1, HIF-1α, and ZEB1/2.
