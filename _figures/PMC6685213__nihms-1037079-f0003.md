caption: A graphic representation illustrates how Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)
  representative viral proteins (in orange) modulate host cellular signalling proteins
  (in blue) to promote cellular survival and the inhibition of apoptosis. Viral proteins
  including KSHV K15, K1, viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) and viral IL-6
  (vIL-6) can activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT)–mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, thereby increasing cell survival and promoting
  protein synthesis. KSHV ORF36 acts further downstream and directly phosphorylates
  cellular ribosomal protein S6, which in turn leads to increased global protein synthesis.
  KSHV ORF36 also phosphorylates JunN-terminal kinase (JNK). Some of the KSHV viral
  proteins, such as vGPCR, K1 and K15, also activate the extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase 1 (ERK1)–ERK2 pathway to promote protein synthesis through the activation
  of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK; which in turn phosphorylates S6), and KSHV ORF45 directly
  binds to RSK, leading to its activation. Note that there is a certain degree of
  crosstalk between both the PI3K–AKT–mTOR and ERK1–ERK2 pathways. Finally, KSHV viral
  FLICE inhibitory protein (vFLIP) potently activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling
  by directly binding NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO). This signalling leads to degradation
  of the inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα, and translocation of the NF-κB transcription factors
  into the nucleus. Dashed lines indicate indirect activation. 4EBP1, eukaryotic translation
