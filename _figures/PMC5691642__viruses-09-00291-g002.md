caption: Suppression of type I IFN production by Flaviviridae viruses. Toll-Like receptors
  (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) receptors are activated by the
  virus; host antiviral responses are then activated, leading to the production of
  type I IFN. The binding of type I IFN to its cognate IFNARs activates the Janus
  kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription factor (STAT) signalling
  pathway. Secreted type I IFNs bind their cognate heterodimeric receptors (IFNAR1
  and IFNAR2) and induce Tyk2 and Jak1 kinase activation, leading to the formation
  of the ISGF3 transcription factor complex. The complex translocates into the nucleus
  and induces the transcription of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Flaviviridae
  have developed multiple strategies to escape or counteract host immune responses,
  including cleaving mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) by hepatitis C virus
  (HCV) NS3/4A; competing with MAVS for binding to stimulator of IFN genes (STING)
  to affect RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) signalling transduction by HCV NS4B; cleaving
  STING by dengue virus (DENV) NS2B3; interacting with TANK-binding Kinase (TBK1)
  by HCV NS2 and NS3; inhibiting TBK1 phosphorylation by West Nile virus (WNV) NS4B
  and DENV4 NS2A and NS4B; inhibiting interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) phosphorylation
  by DENV4 NS2A and NS4B and HCV NS3/4A; inhibiting interferon regulatory factor-7
  (IRF7) activation by interacting with IRF7; interacting with IFNAR1 by Langat virus
  (LGTV) NS5; reducing Tyk2 phosphorylation by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV),
  DENV and JEV NS5; interacting with STAT1 by DENV NS2A, NS4A and NS4B and JEV NS5;
  cleaving STAT1 by DENV NS5; inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation by HCV NS5A, yellow
  fever virus (YFV) and WNV NS4B; inhibiting STAT2 phosphorylation by Kunjin virus
  (KUNV) NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A and NS4B; and suppressing double-stranded RNA-activated
  protein kinase (PKR) and 2’-5’ OAS function by HCV NS5A.
