caption: Schematic figure summarizing the recent studies involving brown adipose tissue
  thermogenesis and secretome. The classical pathway involved in the thermogenesis
  process is initiated with a central stimulus (cold/food) where noradrenaline is
  released and activates the β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR), leading to cyclic adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and heat production/thermogenesis
  through mitochondrial uncoupling by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Variations in plasma
  leptin concentrations are associated with changes in catecholamine concentrations,
  contributing to diet-induced thermogenesis. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAA)
  oxidation in mitochondria makes an important contribution to brown adipose tissue
  (BAT) thermogenesis. Calsyntenin 3β (CLSTN3β) are proteins located in the endoplasmic
  reticulum responsible for inducing the secretion of calcium-binding protein B (S100b),
  which will stimulate sympathetic innervation growth. In addition, γδ T cells contribute
  to the increase in sympathetic innervation through the interleukin-17F (IL-17F)/
  interleukin-17 receptor C (IL-17RC)/transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1) axis,
  highlighting the importance of immune cells in the control of adipocyte metabolism.
  The drug mirabegron has been described in the activation of β3-AR in humans, contributing
  to BAT glucose uptake and whole body glucose homeostasis and energy expenditure.
  Leptin stimulates adrenal medulla activation and contributes to the regulation of
  postprandial thermogenesis by the actions of catecholamines. Emerging “batokines”
  also drive signals to other metabolic tissues, contributing to body homeostasis.
  Recently described “batokines” are myostatin, fibroblast growth factors 6/9 (FGF6/9),
  fibroblast growth factors 21 (FGF21), 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13/diHOME),
  C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14 (CXCL14), and ependymin-related protein 1 (EPDR1);
  however, a recent human secretome identified 101 batokines, and it is probable the
  role of these “batokines” will be described in the near future. TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle. We would like to thank SMART Servier for the images used in the figure
  of this manuscript (https://smart.servier.com).
