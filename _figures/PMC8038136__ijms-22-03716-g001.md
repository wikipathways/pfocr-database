caption: CK1α and CK2 regulate many cellular processes that sustain the tumor phenotype.
  (A) Summary of the biological processes controlled by CK1α and CK2 in blood cancers.
  (B,C) Dissection of the different cellular processes reported in (A). The same color
  code has been used in (A–C). (B) Role of CK2 and CK1α on the Wnt/β-catenin, NF-kB,
  JAK/STAT, and PI3K/AKT/m-TOR signaling pathways, which sustain cell survival and
  proliferation, counteracting apoptosis. Considering the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, CK2
  sustains β-catenin dependent gene expression, while CK1α is responsible for the
  phosphorylation of β-catenin on Ser45, priming it for its subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. Focusing on NF-kB, CK2 directly phosphorylates both IkBα (on Ser283,
  Ser289, and Tyr291) and p65 (on Ser529), promoting the transcription of the NF-kB
  target genes. CK1α phosphorylates CARD11 (on Ser608) and MALT1 (on Ser562), regulating
  the CBM1 complex and NF-kB activation. In the JAK/STAT pathway, CK2 constitutively
  associates with JAK1 and JAK2, favoring STAT5 and STAT3 activation. Considering
  the PI3K/AKT/m-TOR cascade, CK2 directly phosphorylates AKT (on Ser129) and PTEN
  proteins (on Ser370, Thr366, and Ser385). Phosphorylated PTEN is degraded by a proteasomal
  mechanism, indirectly regulating AKT activation. CK1α sustains AKT expression and
  modulates the level of phosphorylated Ser 473 AKT. (C) Role of CK1α and CK2 in ER
  stress, autophagy, and DNA damage response. In ER stress (upper panel), CK2 phosphorylates
  Cdc37 on Ser13, increasing its association with Hsp90. CK2 influences the homeostatic
  molecules regulating UPR, in particular the PERK and IRE1α branches, promoting survival.
  Considering autophagy, (bottom left panel), CK1α phosphorylates FOXO3A (on Ser318
  and Ser321), inhibiting autophagic gene transcription. In the DNA damage response
  (bottom right panel), the interaction of CK1α with the p53 regulators MDM2 and MDMX
  impairs p53 function. CK2 negatively regulates p53 expression and activation. The
