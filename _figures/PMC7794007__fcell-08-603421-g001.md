caption: 'Diagrams depicting the Sestrins-mediated stress signaling pathways and functional
  domains of Sestrin2 in the regulation of metabolism and disease. (A) Schematic diagram
  of Sestrins/mTORC/ROS pathways in obesity and metabolic diseases induced by metabolic
  dysregulation stress. Sestrins improve insulin sensitivity by blocking mTORC1/ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase 1(S6K1) and activating AMPK and mTORC1/AKT pathway. Sestrins also
  inhibit lipid accumulation and ER stress via mTORC1 inhibition through activating
  AMPK and binding GATOR2. Sestrins activate autophagy and mitophagy through mTORC1
  inhibition and ULK1 activation, which contributes to reducing ROS and removing dysfunctional
  mitochondria. ULK1 phosphorylates Sestrin2 to induce mitophagy, and phosphorylated
  Sestrin2 activates ULK1 to further induce autophagy as positive feedback mechanism.
  Sestrins protect cells, tissues and organs by alleviating stresses and pathologies
  associated with obesity and metabolic dysfunctions. (B) Sestrin2 functional domains
  (Sesn-A, Sesn-B, and Sesn-C domains) and residues for: (i) protein stability and
  turnover through ubiquitinations by RNF186 and RBX-1; (ii) redox homeostasis through
  ROS regulation (Cys125); and (iii) nutrient sensing and regulation through leucine
  binding, ULK1 activation, and autophagy induction.'
