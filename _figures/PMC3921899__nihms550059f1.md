caption: 'Long-chain fatty acids enter the cell and are activated by acyl-CoA synthetases
  to form acyl-CoAs, which are then esterified to glycerol-3-phosphate to form LPA
  by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT). A second esterification by 1-acyl-GPAT
  produces PA. The phosphate is cleaved by PA phosphohydrolase (lipin) to form DAG
  and a third esterification converts the DAG to TAG. TAG is hydrolyzed by adipose
  TAG lipase to produce DAG, which can be phosphorylated by DAG kinase to form PA.
  Acyl-CoAs can also be converted to ceramide. Phospholipids can be hydrolyzed by
  PLD to form PA, LPA, PA, DAG, acyl-CoA and ceramides, which are all signaling molecules
  that may interfere with insulin signaling. PA originating from the GPAT pathway
  disrupts the mTOR–rictor complex to inhibit Akt phosphorylation and propagation
  of the insulin signal, and PA derived from PLD hydrolysis stabilizes mTOR/S6K1.
  DAG from the GPAT pathway activates conventional and novel PKC isoforms that phosphorylate
  IRS1 on serine residues and inhibit insulin signaling. LPA synthesized from the
  GPAT pathway may affect insulin signaling by activating PPARγ. Acyl-CoAs may affect
  insulin signaling by interacting at the IRS1/PI3K node. Ceramides may affect glucose
  uptake by inhibiting hexokinase or may activate PKCθ, which disrupts insulin signaling.
  Dashed lines indicate that the interaction may be indirect and have intervening
  nodes.Acyl-CoA: Acyl-coenzyme A; DAG: Diacylglycerol; DGK: DAG kinase; LPA: Lysophosphatidic
