caption: Positive and negative regulation of the receptor-proximal signaling events
  in the IMD pathway. (A) Activation of the IMD pathway signaling by polymeric and
  monomeric DAP-PGN through recognition by PGRP-LC on the plasma membrane, or PGRP-LE
  in the cytoplasm. TCT likely multimerizes intracellular PGRP-LE, dimerizes cell
  surface PGRP-LCx and –LCa, while polymeric DAP-type peptidoglycan is thought to
  cluster PGRP-LCx. Ligand binding is believed to lead to the recruitment of IMD,
  dFADD, and the caspase-8 homolog DREDD to the signaling complex. (B) Negative regulation
  of receptor activation. Active amidases PGRP-LB and PGRP-SC digest polymeric PGN
  to small subunits that do not activate PGRP-LC. PGRP-LF binds PGRP-LC and blocks
  signaling by competitive inhibition. PIRK binds both IMD and the RHIM-like motif
  found in PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, which suppresses the receptor-IMD interaction and
  downstream signaling events.
