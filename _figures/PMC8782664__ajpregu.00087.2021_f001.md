caption: 'A: activation of innate immune response by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
  polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
  pathway. LPS combines with LPS binding protein (LBP) and CD14 and delivers LPS-LBP
  to activate TLR4, initiating both MyD88-dependent pathway and Toll-IL-1 receptor
  domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon β (TRIF)-dependent pathway (). 1)
  MyD88 activates TNF receptor associated factor-6 (TRAF6). In addition, TLR4 recruits
  TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) leading to TRAF6 activation. 2) TRAF6 drives
  the activation of transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which
  activates IκB kinase (IKK) complex and MAPK family members leading to the formation
  of NF-κB dimers and activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex ().
  NF-κB and AP-1 translocate into the nucleus to induce proinflammatory gene expression.
  3) TLR3 is activated by Poly I:C, initiating TRIF-dependent pathway (). TRIF directly
  interacts with TLR3 and dissociation leads to activation of TRAF3 and TRAF6 ().
  4) TRAF3 recruits IKK-related kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), IKKi, and IKKγ
  for Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation and dimer formation ().
  5) After translocation into the nucleus, NF-κB, AP-1, and IRF3 induce proinflammatory
  gene expression. NF-κB and AP-1 induce the expression of proinflammatory genes such
  as Il1b, Il6, and Tnfa (). IRF3 induces the gene expression of type 1 IFN genes,
  such as Ifna and Ifnb (). Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates.
  B: immune response to corona virus through TLR signaling pathway. 6) Severe acute
  respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus binds its cellular receptor
  ACE2 to enter airway epithelial cells (). 7) TLR3, -7, -8, and -9 sense the virus
  in cells. Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 (MDA5) recognize viral RNA and interact with mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein (MAVS) (). The activation of the TLRs and MAVS leads to the formation of
  NF-κB and IRFs dimers. The NF-κB and IRFs dimers translocate into the nucleus. 8)
  Gene expression of type 1 IFN genes and other proinflammatory genes are induced
  by NF-κB and IRF3 (). ACE2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Retrieved from https://app.biorender.com/biorender-templates.'
