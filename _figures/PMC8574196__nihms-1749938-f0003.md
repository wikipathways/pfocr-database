caption: In one pathway, monomeric β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates into oligomers, then
  into fibrils and finally becomes part of amyloid plagues. ABCA1 participates in
  the lipidation of ApoE, which has a strong effect on Aβ fibrillization. ApoE complexes
  with Aβ monomers and, by interacting with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)
  and LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), transports Aβ into the perivascular spaces
  around arterioles and venules for removal by the glymphatic pathway. Heparan sulfate
  proteoglycan (HSPG) also interacts with LRP1 and Aβand influences its oligomerization.
  Within the perivascular space, Aβ can aggregate, which leads to cerebral amyloid
  angiopathy (CAA), which in turn can damage the vascular wall, leading to micro haemorrhages.
  Through the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), lipoproteins,
  including ApoE, influence the phagocytic properties of microglia and might influence
  plague removal. Adapted with permission from REF., Elsevier.
