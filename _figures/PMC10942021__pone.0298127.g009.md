caption: 'mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase)
  are found to be enriched in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis.
  Colored genes are found to be enriched in those pathways and are found to be regulated
  in the combination arm exclusively. Green highlighted genes are found to be upregulated
  by the combination. Red highlighted genes are found to be downregulated by the combination.
  Yellow highlighted gene (RhoA) was shown to be upregulated in OVCAR-3 but downregulated
  in SK-OV-3. DEGs enriched in AMPK include PI3K and FOXO3. According to KEGG, FOXO3
  is a direct target of AMPK forming a positive feedback loop. DEGs enriched in mTOR
  signaling pathway include ATP6V1D, PI3K, SKP2, TNF that control mTOR signaling pathway
  through different trails. KEGG analysis shows that RhoA is a direct target of mTORC2.
  PI3K is activated by insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), a signaling protein that
  is phosphorylated and activated upon the interaction between insulin growth factor
  and its receptor or even by SCF (c-kit ligand) that is also shown to be targeted
  by the combination of MTF and SIM. Activated PI3K activates mTORC2 by direct phosphorylation
  or by indirect activation via IKKα. Second it activates AKT which in turn activates
  mTORC1 directly or indirectly via inhibition of TSC2 or IKKα. SKP2 inhibits FOXO3,
  p21, p27, RagA/B, C/D and activates cyclin E, CDK2 and AKT. ATP6V1D activates RagA/B
  and Rag C/D; dotted arrow: indirect activation (Original figure)'
