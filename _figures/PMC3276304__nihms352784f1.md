caption: IGFBPs determine the IGF-I accessibility to its receptor through IGF-I binding,
  while IGFBPs may also possess IGF-I binding independent action. For example, IGFBP-2
  suppresses PTEN expression in osteoblastic cells and IGFBP-3 binds to RXRα and regulates
  PPARγ transcriptional activity in adipocytic cells. Circulating IGF-I has a significant
  impact on adipose and skeletal development, whereas locally produced IGF-I also
  functions in an autocrine/paracrine manner. IGF-I stimulates adipogenesis in part
  through the activation of PI3K pathway and also enhances the maturation of pre-osteoblasts
  into osteoblasts.
