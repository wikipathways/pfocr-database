caption: The Monolignol Biosynthetic Pathway in P. trichocarpa.Thirty-five metabolic
  fluxes (V0 to V35, represented by the circled numbers) mediate the conversion of
  24 metabolites (underlined numbers) for monolignol synthesis by the 21 pathway enzymes.
  First, the deamination of Phe to cinnamic acid is catalyzed by five isoforms of
  phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL1 to PAL5). Cinnamic acid is then hydroxylated to
  4-coumaric acid and subsequently to caffeic acid by a multiple-protein complex of
  C4H and C3H (). There are two isoforms of C4H (C4H1 and C4H2) and one of C3H (C3H3).
  Two isoforms of 4-coumaric acid:CoA ligase (4CL3 and 4CL5) activate the hydroxycinnamic
  acids to their corresponding CoA-thioesters. A cooperative interaction between the
  C4H-C3H protein complex and two isoforms of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase (HCT1 and HCT6), hydroxylate 4-coumaroyl-CoA at the ring-3 position
  to caffeoyl-CoA. Three isoforms of caffeoyl CoA O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT1-3)
  methylate caffeoyl-CoA to give feruloyl-CoA, which is reduced to coniferaldehyde
  by a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR2). Two isoforms of CAld5H (CAld5H1 and CAld5H2)
  and one 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde O-methyltransferase (AldOMT2) hydroxylate and methylate
  coniferaldehyde and coniferyl alcohol sequentially at the ring-5 position to give
  sinapaldehyde and sinapyl alcohol. The hydroxycinnamaldehydes are reduced to hydroxycinnamyl
  alcohols by two isoforms of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD1 and CAD2). Cofactors
  are reduced NADPH, NADP+, CoA, ATP, AMP, pyrophosphate (PPi), S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).
