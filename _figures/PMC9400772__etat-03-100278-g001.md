caption: 'PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and interaction with ER signaling. The binding of
  IGF to IGFR leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor and IRS-1. IRS-1 leads
  to splitting of heterodimeric complex (p85, p110) and activation of p110 which via
  its PI3K activity converts PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 translocates to the plasma membrane
  and binds to Akt, allowing phosphorylation at T308 by PDK1 which achieves partial
  activation of Akt. Full activation of Akt is achieved by phosphorylation at S473
  by mTOR. Active Akt phosphorylates S167 facilitate activation of downstream ER nuclear
  transcriptional activity []. Upregulation of IGFR, constitutively active PI3K or
  loss of PTEN leads to activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, increased ligand-independent
  activation of ER, and resistance to ET. IGF: insulin growth factor; IGFR: IGF receptor;
  IRS-1: IR substrate-1; ERE: estrogen response element; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; PDK1: 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1; ER: estrogen receptor'
