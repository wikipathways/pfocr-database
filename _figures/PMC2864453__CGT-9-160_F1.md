caption: Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) can be activated by a multitude of different stimuli,
  like TNFα, LPS and CD40L. Activation of the canonical (also known as classical)
  pathway via Toll-like receptor (TLR) or cytokine receptor signaling depends on the
  IKK complex, which is composed of the kinases IKKα and IKKβ, and the regulatory
  subunit IKKγ (NEMO). Activated IKK phosphorylates (P) IκBα to induce its degradation
  by the 26S proteasome, allowing NF-κB dimers (p50-p65) to translocate to the nucleus
  and bind to DNA to induce NF-κB target gene transcription. Activation of the non-canonical
  (also known as alternative) pathway is strictly dependent on IKKα homodimers. The
  target for IKKα homodimers is NF-κB2/p100, which upon activation of IKKα by NIK
  is phosphorylated and incompletely degraded into p52, resulting in the release and
  nuclear translocation of p52-RelB dimers. This pathway can be triggered by the activation
  of members of the TNF-receptor superfamily such as CD40 (that also induce canonical
  NF-κB signaling), but not via pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs.
