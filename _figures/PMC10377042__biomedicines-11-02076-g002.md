caption: Mechanism of PBUTs and PTH-mediated skeletal muscle atrophy. Redox signaling
  changes in CKD, caused by uremic toxins, inflammation, and metabolic/hormonal shifts,
  resulting in oxidative stress, leading to muscle wasting and bone loss. ① Mild accumulation
  of PBUTs significantly contributes to muscle wasting in early-stage CKD (stages
  2–3). Molecular mechanisms involved include imbalanced protein degradation and synthesis,
  increased reactive ROS and inflammatory cytokines, activation of myostatin and atrogene
  expression, impaired mitochondrial function, and negative effects from uremic toxins,
  parathyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, and angiotensin II. IS enters muscle cells
  using an OAT, where IS stimulates the pathway of AhR and NADPH oxidase to induce
  the production of ROS. Excessive production of ROS will produce inflammatory cytokines
  when myostatin and atrogin-1 are overexpressed, and this will be linked to muscle
  atrophy. The production of ROS has an impact on mitochondrial function. pCS induces
  insulin resistance in muscles due to decreased insulin or IGF-1-IRS-AKT capacity
  triggered by ERK1/2 activity. In late CKD (stages 4–5D), cachexia is a syndrome
  characterized by further increased energy expenditure and loss of muscle and adipose
  tissues. In addition to the further increase in PBUT levels, the excessive levels
  of PTH have detrimental effects on skeletal muscle metabolism, leading to aggravated
  muscle weakness and atrophy. ② High PTH levels are associated with sarcopenia and
  contribute to muscle loss. PTH and PTHrP drive adipose tissue browning and muscle
  wasting in cachexia. Elevated PTH indirectly leads to decreased muscle protein synthesis
  by acting on PTH receptors expressed in adipose tissue, thereby activating the expression
  of thermogenic genes, and finally causing muscle hypermetabolism and atrophy.
