caption: 'Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) participates in both defence and offence in
  host immunity to viruses. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, a common intermediate of replication
  among many viruses. TLR3 dimerization and Tyr phosphorylation trigger the recruitment
  of the adaptor protein Toll–interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein
  interferon-β (TRIF), and induce the activation of the transcription factors interferon
  (IFN) regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator
  protein-1 (AP-1) through two branches. TLR3 activation leads to (i) the development
  of an antiviral response mediated by IRF3 activation and further type I IFN production;
  (ii) cell death through a Fas-associated protein with death domain /caspase-8-dependent
  and mitochondrion-independent pathway (RIP1/ Fas-associated protein with death domain);
  and (iii) the generation of a pro-inflammatory environment by the activation of
  NF-κB and AP-1, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) the extracellular
  signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK), the p38 MAP kinases (p38), and the c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase (JNK), which differentially regulate many cellular functions including
  inflammation-mediated inflammatory processes. Despite the detrimental role of TLR3
  in viral pathogenesis being poorly understood, three major mechanisms have been
  identified: (i) over-expression of TLR3 (only observed in some viral infections
  but not others); (ii) over-production of cytokines [tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),
  interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12p40/p70, and IFN-γ], chemokines [regulated on activation,
  normal T-celll expressed and secreted (RANTES), IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1)], and the immune suppressive molecule programmed death ligand-1
  (PDL-1); (iii) dysregulation of T helper type 1 and 2 (Th1/Th2) polarization. However,
  the precise molecular mechanisms that lead to TLR3 hyper-responsiveness are unknown.
  Over-production of inflammatory mediators leads to dysregulation of leucocyte trafficking,
  blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and mechanisms to be identified. A detrimental
  role of TLR3 has been identified in mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV) and
  Theiler''s murine encephalomyelitis (TMEV) (encephalitis), Punta Toro virus (PTV)
  (hepatitis), and in respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus
  (RSV), vaccinia virus, influenza A virus and rhinovirus RV1B (pneumonia). In humans,
  TLR3 may contribute to glomerulonephritis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus
  infection. Finally, TLR3 hyper-responsiveness may play a detrimental role in virus-triggered
  autoimmunity.'
