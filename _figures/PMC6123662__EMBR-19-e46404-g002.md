caption: 'Upon beta‐3 adrenergic receptor activation following noradrenaline release
  by sympathetic nerve endings in response to cold, glucose is taken up by brown adipocytes
  via glucose transporters 1 and 4 (GLUT1/4). Glucose then undergoes glycolysis to
  generate dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), pyruvate, and lactate in the cytosol.
  Simultaneously, glucose‐6‐phosphate (glucose‐6‐P) feeds into the pentose phosphate
  pathway to generate ribulose‐5‐P and NADPH which is used for lipogenesis and also
  into glycogen synthesis and breakdown pathways. Pyruvate and/or lactate are next
  transported into the mitochondria via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and for
  pyruvate, the pyruvate carrier 1 (PC1), while DHAP is converted into glycerol‐3‐P
  by glycerol‐3‐phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1). Once inside the mitochondria, pyruvate
  is converted into acetyl‐CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). If lactate is indeed
  transported into mitochondria, it would be converted by LDH back into pyruvate.
  Acetyl‐CoA then undergoes partial breakdown in the TCA cycle into citrate by citrate
  synthase (CS) which is then exported by the citrate carrier (CC) into the cytosol.
  Citrate then feeds into a lipogenic pathway after being converted back into acetyl‐CoA
  by ATP citrate lyase (ACL). Acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN),
  glycerol‐3‐phosphat‐O‐acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), AGPAT2, lipin 1, and diacylglycerol
  O‐acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) then contribute to the generation of triglycerides (TG)
  from fatty acids and glycerol‐3‐P. These then rapidly undergo lipolysis in cytosolic
  lipid droplets through the action of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone‐sensitive
  lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). The liberated fatty acids either
  activate UCP1 to generate heat or are next converted into acyl‐CoA by long chain
  acyl‐CoA synthase 1 (ACSL1) and then transported into the mitochondria via the sequential
  action of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), translocase, and CPT2. Once inside
  the mitochondria, acyl‐CoA undergoes β‐oxidation by acyl‐CoA deyhyrogeneses (ACD)
  to generate the necessary proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
  The liberated glycerol from lipolysis is phosphorylated by glycerol kinase (GK)
  into glycerol‐3‐P to facilitate fatty acid re‐esterification. Similarly, pyruvate
  carboxylase (PC) generates oxaloacetate (OA) from pyruvate, which is then converted
  into malate (MA) by malate dehydrogenase 2 (MD2). MA is exported outside of the
  mitochondria into the cytosol by the alpha‐ketoglutarate malate uniporter (AKMU)
  where it is reconverted back into OA by MD1. Finally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  1 (PCK1) generates phosphoenolpyruvate which feeds G3P synthesis required for fatty
  acid re‐esterification. Fatty acids and glycerol released from lipolysis may enter
  an extracellular loop via fatty acid transport protein1 (FATP) and aquaporin 3/7/9
  (AQP 3/7/9) as part of the fatty acid recycling pathway. Abbreviations: HK2, hexokinase
