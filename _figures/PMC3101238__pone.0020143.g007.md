caption: 'The cell line is shown without and upon various treatment regimens (OMP,
  5-FU or 5-FU+OMP combination). The nodes of this network symbolize metabolite signals,
  their colours correspond to relative signal intensity (when compared to an external
  standard) as indicated in the heatmap scale below. The signal intensity is linearly
  related to the intracellular concentration. The background of the nodes are left
  blank when the signal intensity is out of the range indicated by the heatmap scale.
  The lines between the boxes symbolize strongly simplified metabolic pathways. The
  colors of these lines indicate significant differences of the signal intensity ratios
  of the connected metabolites compared to the control group when orange (p<0.05),
  red lines indicate p<0.01. Upon OMP, the PC/Cho ratios are significantly lower compared
  to control. Furthermore the acetate/FACH2 ratio is significantly decreased in the
  OMP group. The latter also showed a higher CH = CH level, the ratio to FACH2 is,
  however, decreased. Upon 5-FU and 5-FU+OMP, similar changes could be observed. Furthermore,
  in contrast to ASPC-1 cells, the Ala/Gln/AMP pathway is also involved. Abbreviations:
  Gln - glutamine, Ala - alanine, PC - phosphatidylcholine, Cho - Choline. Lac1+FACH2
  - methyl group signal of lactate and methylene groups of the fatty acids, Lac2 -
  methylene group of lactate, CH = CH - protons of methin groups of unsaturated fatty
  acids.'
