caption: Overview of the RIGI-like receptor pathway. Viral RNAs are recognized in
  the cytosol by the helicases RIGI or MDA5. The amino-termini of RIGI and MDA5 contain
  two CARD domains that interact with the CARD domain of the mitochondrial adaptor
  MAVS. MAVS, after recruitment of transactivators, induces phosphorylation of IRF3
  and IRF7 and NF-κB activation, leading to the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, respectively. dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  IκBα, inhibitor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, α; IKKɛ, IκB kinase;
  IRF, interferon response factor; MDA5, melanoma differentiation associated gene
  5; NAP, NF-κB-activating kinase-associated protein; NEMO, NF-κB essential modifier;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; pppssRNA, 5′ triphosphate single stranded RNA; RIGI, retinoic
  acid-inducible gene I; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TAB, TAK1-associated
  binding protein; TAK, TGF-β-activated kinase; TANK, TRAF family member-associated
  NF-κB activator; TBK, TANK-binding kinase; TRAF, TNF-receptor-associated factor.
