caption: Representation of the cross talk among different pathways under water-deficit
  conditions. Dehydration stress leads to turgor imbalance and production of ROS.
  The turgor imbalance is mechanosensed, leading to modification in cytoskeleton proteins
  (lectins, actin, fibrillin) and sugars (mannose, aldolase) in turn leading to stretch-activation
  of ion channels (H+ ATPases, Ca2+) and activation of Ca2+/calmodulin signaling pathway.
  Wall sugars are mobilized and activate SnRK. Cell wall undergoes modifications like
  lignification and contraction. The stress is sensed by receptors (CBPK, WAKs, protein
  kinases, receptor kinases), which interact with GTPase. GTPase activates ABA and
  14-3-3. Level of 14-3-3 increases with ROS production and parallely interacts and
  activates ABA and SnRK. 14-3-3 translocates to the nucleus and interacts with ACDH
  leading to choromatin remodeling and activation of transcription factors (AP2, DREB,
  RF2B, TLP). ABA interacts with the FCA receptors, and nuclear envelope protein SUN1
  detects the ion channel activation owing to mechanosensing further leading to activation
  of TFs.
