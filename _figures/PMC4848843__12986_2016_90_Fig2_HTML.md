caption: Regulation of lipid metabolism by BAF60a and BAF60c in periportal and perivenous
  hepatocytes, respectively, under the control of nutritional and hormonal signals.
  In periportal (PP) hepatocytes, PGC-1α is deacetylated by SIRT1 and activates its
  activity during fasting. In this state, PGC-1α mediates the recruitment of BAF60a
  to PPARα-binding sites, to transcriptional activation of mitochondrial fat-oxidation
  genes, leading promoting the oxidation of fatty acids. The acetyl-CoA is produced
  by fatty acid oxidation and transported from mitochondria to cytoplasm. In perivenous
  (PV) hepatocytes, insulin-mediated activation of atypical PKCζ/λ via the PI3K pathway
  induces SREBP-1c expression. BAF60c recruits BAF subunits including BAF155, BAF190,
  and BAF250 for the formation of lipoBAF complex to activate lipogenic program. BAF60c
  is phosporylated by aPKC in response to feeding/insulin. Phosphorylated BAF60c translocates
  from the cytosol to the nucleus and directly interacts with phosphorylated/acetylated
  USF, thus allowing recruitment of lipoBAF and remodeling of chromatin to activate
  lipogenic genes. USF-1, which is phosphorylated by DNA-PK and then acetylated by
  P/CAF, recruits BAF60c. DNA-PK is activated by PP1. USF-1 bound to the -65 E-box
  recruits SREBP-1c to bind the nearby SRE during feeding/insulin. The closely spaced
  arrangement of the E-box and SRE in many lipogenic promoters may allow USF-1 and
  SREBP-1c to cooperatively activate lipogenic genes transcription, leading to increased
  in the expression of ATP citrate lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and
  fatty acid synthase (FAS), to facilitate the synthesis of fatty acids. Moreover,
  PGC-1α is acetylated by GCN5 resulting in a transcriptionally inactive protein in
  response to feeding/insulin. Since fatty acid oxidation occur mainly in PV hepatocyte,
  whereas lipogenesis occur predominantly in PP hepatocyte. Therefore, the acetyl-CoA
  in PP hepatocyte is transported into PV hepatocyte and used for fatty acid synthesis,
  whereas the fatty acid in PV hepatocyte is shifted to PP hepatocyte and oxidated
  to acetyl-CoA
