caption: Model of the ςB signal transduction network. (A) Two signaling pathways converge
  on phosphorylated RsbV (RsbV-P), the antagonist form found in unstressed cells.
  The energy-signaling pathway terminates with the RsbP PP2C phosphatase, which may
  employ its PAS domain to sense energy stress (). In contrast, the environmental
  signaling pathway terminates with the RsbU PP2C phosphatase, which is activated
  by upstream elements (, ). When activated by stress, either the RsbP or the RsbU
  phosphatase removes the serine phosphate from RsbV-P (, , ). Dephosphorylated RsbV
  then binds the RsbW anti-ς factor, forcing it to release ςB, which can then activate
  its target general stress genes (, , ). (B) The upstream signaling elements which
  activate RsbU include the RsbS antagonist and the RsbT kinase, which are homologs
  of RsbV and RsbW, respectively (, ). Unphosphorylated RsbS is thought to be the
  antagonist form found in unstressed cells, and this form binds the RsbT kinase.
  Following environmental stress, RsbS is phosphorylated by RsbT, which is then released
  to bind and activate the RsbU phosphatase by direct protein-protein interaction
  (, ). Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that RsbR (shaded) acts as a positive
  regulator of ςB activity by magnifying the activity of the RsbT kinase (, ). In
  contrast, the RsbX PP2C phosphatase appears to fulfill a feedback role by indirectly
  communicating the level of ςB protein in the cell (, , ). We show here that the
  four RsbR paralogs (shaded box) also act via the environmental signaling pathway.
