caption: 'Solid colored and black arrows indicate known metabolic pathway steps for
  conversion of aromatic intermediates into central metabolites, with dotted black
  arrows indicating predicted metabolic pathway steps. Dotted gray lines indicate
  heterologous pathways to convert aromatic intermediates to value-added aromatic
  derivatives. Red boxed compounds are those whose production from deconstructed lignin
  have been demonstrated, including itaconate from this study. Acronyms used above:
  4-HB (4-hydroxybenzoate), 3-MMA (3-methylmuconate), 2,5-PDCA (2,5-pyridinedicarboxylate),
  2,4-PDCA (2,4-pyridinedicarboxylate), β-KA (β-ketoadipate), 2-HMSA (2-hydroxymuconate
  semialdehyde), 4-OMA (4-oxalomesaconate).'
