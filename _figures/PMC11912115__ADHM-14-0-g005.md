caption: Schematic illustration of the nature‐inspired design and immune‐inert biomodulation
  of endogenous protein‐modified gold nanorods (eP@Au NRs) through the suppression
  of PI3K‐Akt/MAPK signaling pathways under NIR light for tumor‐specific imaging and
  therapy. a) Schematic illustration of the acquisition approach of endogenous proteins
  from blood. b) Schematic illustration of the synthesis procedures of PEG@Au and
  eP@Au NRs. c) Schematic illustration of specifically activated imaging and therapeutic
  functionalities of eP@Au NRs for tumors via eP‐propelled biomodulation triggered
  by the suppression of PI3K‐Akt/MAPK signaling pathways under NIR irradiation
