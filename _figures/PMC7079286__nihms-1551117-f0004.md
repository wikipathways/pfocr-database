caption: A) KEGG mapping of immune response-associated proteins by Uniprot ID for
  Mus musculus of complement and coagulation cascades. B) KEGG mapping of immune response-associated
  proteins by Uniprot ID for Mus musculus of leukocyte transendothelial migration.
  C) KEGG mapping of immune response-associated proteins by Uniprot ID for Mus musculus
  of phagosome. Figures generated with KEGG mapper. Proteins with increased abundance
  (red) and decreased abundance (blue) during P. aeruginosa infection of murine cornea
  relative to control (mock infected). D) Mapping of murine immune response-associated
  proteins identified in the corneal proteome to human proteins and biological process
  pathway. Represented categories with proteins demonstrating an increase in abundance
  during P. aeruginosa infection of murine cornea relative to control (mock infected)
  (dark grey). Figure generated with Reactome.org.
