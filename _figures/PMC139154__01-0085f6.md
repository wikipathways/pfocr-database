caption: A Model Positioning EDS1, PAD4, and NDR1 in Relation to LSD1 in Plant Defenses.As
  shown in the model, RCD in lsd1 mutants is initiated in tissues adjacent to pathogen
  infection foci. The roles of EDS1, PAD4, and NDR1 in lsd1 RCD are separable from
  events controlling the plant HR and its accompanying oxidative burst (ROI) that
  are elicited upon avirulent pathogen recognition. EDS1, but not PAD4, functions
  upstream of localized HR and ROI production in resistance conditioned by TIR-NB-LRR–type
  R genes. In contrast, resistance conditioned by CC-NB-LRR–type R genes operates
  independently of EDS1 or PAD4 but requires NDR1. Irrespective of the different requirements
  for EDS1 and PAD4 at initial infection foci, both components are essential for signal
  relay leading to RCD in lsd1. Because EDS1 and PAD4 are also necessary for lsd1
  RCD in response to the artificial provision of ROI or an active SA analog, we propose
  that EDS1 and PAD4 regulate a ROI/SA-dependent defense signal amplification loop.
  Flux through this loop is modulated by LSD1. NDR1 also is required for maximal lesion
  development in lsd1 plants in response to pathogens. The data suggest that NDR1
  acts more proximally by regulating ROI balance and transduction of ROI-dependent
  signals at infection sites (see Discussion for more details).
