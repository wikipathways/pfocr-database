caption: Major Apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is driven by Fas-type death
  receptors. Upon engagement with their ligands, these receptors trimerize and the
  death adaptor protein FADD is recruited to the intracellular death domain of Fas.
  FADD then recruits pro-capsase-8 into this complex completing the formation of the
  death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). The induced juxtaposition of pro-caspase-8
  results in autocatalytic cleavage and activation of caspase-8. Caspase-8 then dissociates
  from the receptor and enters the cytoplasm to initiate the cleavage other caspases
  or cellular proteins. The intrinsic pathway (activated by cytotoxic drugs, radiation
  or reactive oxygen species) involves the damage of mitochondrion. The Bcl2 and Bax
  proteins counteract each other in steady sate. Signal-induced rise in Bax and/or
  dissociation of Bcl2:Bax complex by Bak results in the formation of Bax:Bax or Bax:Bak
  oligomers, which insert into the mitochondrial membrane and open permeability transition
  pores (PTP). This leads to the release of many apoptotic inducing factors such as
  AIF, HtrA2, Endonuclease G (EndoG), Smac/Diablo and cytochrome-c. Cytochrome-c associates
  with apoptosis-activating factor-1 (APAF1) and pro-caspase-9 leading to formation
  of ‘Apoptosome’. Activated caspase-9 from this complex activates other caspases,
  which dismantle the cellular proteins required for viability. Although thought to
  operate independently, in some cell types, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
  cross regulate each other. In these scenarios, caspase-8 from the DISC cleaves the
  pro-apoptotic Bcl2-like protein, Bid, to generate a truncated version, t-Bid. The
  latter causes mitochondrial damage, which amplifies the apoptotic response through
  the formation of Apoptosome. A number of proteins in this pathway are controlled
  by IFNs and other cytokines.
