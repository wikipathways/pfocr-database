caption: Integrated salt response pathway network in P. euphratica. Dark blue arrows (active
  or repress) indicate known salt-response pathways in plants, other edges indicate
  co-expression relationships of the up- or down-regulated core genes connected with
  the Calcium (Ca2+) or ABA signal in the known pathways. Cyan nodes, TFs; red nodes,
  up-regulated core genes; green nodes, down-regulated core genes. Based on the relationships
  between identified TFs and up- or down-regulated core genes, three main TF clusters
  (1, 2, and 3) were identified. TF cluster 1 strongly connected with Ca2+ related
  up- or down-regulated core genes and might be involved in ABA-dependent pathway,
  TF cluster 2 strongly connected with Ca2+ related up- or down-regulated core genes
  but didn’t connected with ABA pathway, while TF cluster 3 weakly connected with
  several Ca2+ related up- or down-regulated core genes.
