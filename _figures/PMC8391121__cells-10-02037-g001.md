caption: 'Pyk2-mediated signaling in invadopodia. Extracellular stimulation by EGFR
  and integrins leads to activation of Pyk2, which tyrosine phosphorylates cortactin
  both directly and indirectly by activating Src and Arg kinases. Activation of Src
  leads to invadopodium precursor assembly and stabilization by recruiting and phosphorylating
  Tks5. Complete tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin leads to activation of several
  signaling pathways, which induce actin polymerization and ECM degradation and consequent
  invadopodia-mediated tumor cell invasion, intravasation, and metastatic dissemination.
  While promoting cell invasion and dissemination, Arg simultaneously inhibits the
  Ras-MAPK pathway, which induces cell proliferation and consequent tumor growth,
  acting as a switch in metastatic cancer cells that govern the decision to “grow
  or go” (divide or invade). Inset: the coherent type I feedforward loop with AND
  gating (left) parallels the Pyk2-Src-Arg-cortactin pathway (right). The different
  NRTKs, their substrates, and invadopodial roles are described in .'
