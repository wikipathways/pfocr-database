caption: Deletion of ERα in uterine epithelial cells leads to infertility, however,
  this receptor loss does not prevent estrogen induced epithelial cell proliferation
  (). In this regard, tissue recombination studies have also shown that ERα action
  in stromal cells mediates the estrogenic proliferation events in the epithelium
  via a paracrine manner (; ). In addition, Pawar et al also showed that epithelial
  ERα controls uterine decidualization via a paracrine mechanism through epithelial-stromal
  cross-talk during the early implantation (). Similarly down regulation of the progesterone
  receptor in the uterine epithelium is depended on stromal ERα (). The theory of
  interdependency between the endometrial epithelium and stroma proposes an intercellular
  cross talk through different signaling pathways (), which can mimic the effects
  of the traditional ligand-receptor pathway.
