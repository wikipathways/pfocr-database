caption: Overlapping and distinct functional complexes for BEN-solo proteins. (A)
  The heterotrimeric ELBA complex has been associated with a single target site thus
  far, located in the Fab-7 insulator. (B) All three Drosophila BEN-solo proteins
  efficiently recognize the binding site consensus originally established for Insv.
  Insv has been shown to broadly regulate neurogenesis-related genes through such
  binding sites and is shown here to also occupy a number of insulator regions through
  its cognate site. Since all BEN-solo proteins can recognize the same site, we predict
  that Bsg25A and Elba2 may prove to occupy at least some of these Insv target regions.
  (C) Insv is recruited indirectly to DNA via a protein–protein interaction with the
  Notch pathway transcription factor Su(H), where it functions in a default repressor
  complex. Su(H) similarly recruits the corepressor H. It is not currently known whether
  H and Insv can co-bind Su(H) or occupy distinct Su(H) complexes (?) or whether Insv
  associates with the Su(H) corepressor complex as a monomer or homodimer (??). (D)
  As is true for many other transcription factors, Insv ChIP-seq data indicate binding
  to a number of genomic regions that lack either direct binding sites or Su(H)-binding
  sites. It remains to be elucidated whether any of these represent specific and/or
  functional recruitment events (?) through either nonconsensus binding sites or perhaps
  interactions with other chromatin proteins.
