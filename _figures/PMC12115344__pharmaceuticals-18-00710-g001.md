caption: 'A diagrammatic overview of key pathways involved in ALD. This illustration
  outlines the principal signaling pathways activated during the progression of ALD.
  Chronic alcohol consumption disrupts the gut–liver axis, facilitates the translocation
  of endotoxins (e.g., LPS), and activates liver-resident immune cells, such as Kupffer
  cells, via TLR signaling. This activation subsequently triggers downstream signaling
  cascades, including the NF-κB, MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways, leading to enhanced
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased oxidative stress, and sustained
  hepatic injury. Abbreviations: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase;
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1c; PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma; FAS, fatty
  acid synthase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; LDL-Chl, low density lipoprotein cholesterol;
  HDL-Chl, high density lipoprotein cholesterol. ↓: Downregulation; ↑: Upregulation'
