caption: Antigen-mediated chemotaxis. Aggregation of the FcεRI by multivalent antigen
  leads to rapid Lyn kinase-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in ITAM
  motifs of FcεRI β and γ subunits. This is followed by anchoring of Syk to FcεRI
  γ through interaction of Syk SH2 domains with phosphorylated ITAMs. Syk then phosphorylates
  transmembrane adaptor proteins NTAL and LAT and creates binding sites for various
  SH2-containing proteins like Grb2. In this way it brings PI3K and Gab2 to the plasma
  membrane. Activated PI3K generates PIP3, a binding site for PH-domain containing
  protein Btk. This leads to further propagation of the signal through activation
  of PLCγ, resulting in Ca2+ release and actin rearrangement. Levels of free intracellular
  Ca2+ are positively regulated by aggregated STIM1. Another PI3K-dependent pathway
  contributes to activation of p38 and consequently to enhanced chemotactic response.
  Grb2 orchestrates activation of Ras by recruiting small GTPases Ras and Rho family
  GEFs, Sos, Vav, and other signaling molecules, resulting in actin rearrangement
  and chemotaxis. NTAL could play a negative regulatory role in chemotaxis through
  activation of Rho/ROCK pathway that is responsible for controlling the rear edge
  of the migrating cell. ROCK could also activate the PTEN phosphatase which inhibits
  activity of PI3K and in this way decreases the PIP3 levels.
