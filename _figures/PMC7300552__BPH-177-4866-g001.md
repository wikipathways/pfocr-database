caption: ACE2 function and its regulation in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection. ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase that catalyses and inactivates
  angiotensin I and angiotensin II, respectively, into the vasodilator peptides angiotensin‐(1–9)
  and angiotensin‐(1–7), which bind Mas receptor (MasR) leading to reduced inflammation
  and vasodilation. ACE2 also cleaves [des‐Arg9]bradykinin ([des‐Arg9]BK), a bioactive
  kinin derived from kininogen pathway, into inactive metabolites. ACE2 is the cell
  entry target for SARS‐CoV‐2. The binding of viral spike glycoprotein with ACE2 and
  the priming of the spike through the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) lead
  to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The binding of SARS‐CoV‐2 down‐regulates ACE2 expression,
  leading to a reduction of its enzymatic activity and the ensuing increase of angiotensin
  II and [des‐Arg9]BK levels. Angiotensin II takes its deleterious effect by binding
  the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), whereas [des‐Arg9]BK concurs to inflammation
  by binding bradykinin 1 receptor (B1R), resulting in severe lung injury, pulmonary
  inflammation and oedema, increased coagulation, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy,
  which are all features of coronavirus disease 2019 patients
