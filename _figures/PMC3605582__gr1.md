caption: 'Overview of key mediators of innate and adaptive immunity, development,
  and signalling. This is presented to provide context for genetic variants implicated
  in different Mendelian diseases with immune phenotypes (indicated by red filled
  circles numbered from 1 to 30), and common autoimmune diseases (blue filled circles
  numbered from 1 to 21). These numbers correspond to the diseases described in .
  (a) Development of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages is shown together with key
  cell types involved in innate and adaptive immunity. (b) The role of an antigen-presenting
  cell (illustrated here for a dendritic cell) is shown, including antigen presentation
  via the endogenous pathway (MHC class I molecules) or the exogenous pathway (MHC
  class II molecules). The MHC gene locus is shown in terms of the classical class
  I and class II regions, with the intervening class III region. (c) Toll-like receptor
  signalling is a key component of the innate immune response involved in pathogen
  recognition (). (d) IL-12/IL-23 receptors and the JAK–STAT signalling pathways are
  central to the cytokine cascade and inflammatory response together with modulation/expansion
  of Th17 cells. Genetic variation in genes encoding different proteins in these pathways
  has been associated with autoimmunity by recent GWAS implicating dysregulation of
  IL-12 signalling (Th1 cells) and IL-23 signalling (Th17 cells) . Abbreviations:
  IKK, inhibitor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells kinase; IL-1Rs, interleukin-1
  receptors; IRAK, IL-1R-associated kinase; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; JAK,
  Janus kinase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary-response protein 88; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; NK cell, natural killer
  cell; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TCR, T cell receptor;
  Tfh, follicular helper T cell; Th, T helper cell; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TRAF,
