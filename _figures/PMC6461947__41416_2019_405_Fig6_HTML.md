caption: Current understanding of SHON and ERα signalling. Classically, ERα signalling
  is initiated following the binding of oestrogen (E2) to oestrogen receptor, resulting
  in its translocation to nucleus and binding directly to oestrogen response elements
  (EREs) on gene promoter of oestrogen-regulated genes, which subsequently activate
  transcription of downstream genes. Anti-oestrogen tamoxifen (Tam) competes with
  E2 for binding to ERα. SHON may bind to a yet-unknown receptor and activate PI3K/AKT
  and MAPK pathways that are linked to the action of ERα. SHON may also activate TGF-β
  pathway, resulting in SMAD2/3/4 translocation to nucleus and causing inhibition
  of ERα transcriptional activity upon Tam induction. Exogenous and/or intracellular
  pools of SHON may also enter the nucleus, thus enhancing the transcriptional activity
  of ERα
