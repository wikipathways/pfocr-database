caption: The main brain-immune system pathways and feedback loops illustrating the
  interconnected effects of physical and emotional stress in health. Sympathetic nervous
  system (SNS) activation facilitates immune cell activity and systemic immune responses,
  while the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis generally inhibit inflammatory responses. In a well-regulated system,
  cortisol provides negative feedback to the HPA axis. Chronic activation of the stress
  response systems can lead to excessive immune cell activity and promote system inflammation
  due to the reduced activity of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway and development
  of glucocorticoid insensitivity. Cytokines regulate autonomic nervous system function
  and the HPA axis as well as induce sickness behaviors. The brain receives information
  about systemic inflammation levels via the afferent vagal nerve and “leaky” portions
  of the blood brain barrier especially near the circumventricular organs and these
  messages influence cytokine production within the brain. Often elevated systemic
  inflammation increases glia production of cytokines. CRP, C-reactive protein; AVP,
