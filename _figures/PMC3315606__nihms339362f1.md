caption: The cellular prion protein (PrP) consists of 3 α-helical domains and a highly
  disordered but functionally conserved N-terminal domain that interacts with a number
  of key regulatory proteins of several pathways to promote cell survival and proliferation.
  PrP has been shown to directly bind the chaperone protein αβ-crystallin which could
  then promote cell cycle progression via de-repression of cyclin D1 and also via
  the conversion of the p53 tumor suppressor to a mutant conformation. PrP can inhibit
  the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. It can potentially
  inhibit the activation of caspases and/or pro-apoptotic Bax and promote the stabilization
  of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2. PrP over-expression can also activate the PI3k/Akt
  pathway promoting cancer cell invasion and metastasis via increased expression of
  the matrix metalloproteinase 11 (MMP11). A putative prion infected mutant p53 could
  promote cell cycle progression and prevent apoptosis via the functional alteration
  of wild-type p53. Solid arrows in the figure indicate documented interactions from
  the literature and dashed arrows indicate hypothetical interactions proposed in
  this review.
