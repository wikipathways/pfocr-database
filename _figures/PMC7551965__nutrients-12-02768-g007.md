caption: Schematic of roles of Mg2+ in excitotoxicity. The transport and effects of
  Mg2+ and mTOR demonstrated in this study are shown in red. In this study, we demonstrated
  that glutamate stimulus induces not only Mg2+ released from mitochondria but also
  Mg2+ extrusion from the cytosol, and quinidine and amiloride inhibit it. Maintaining
  Mg2+ in neurons suppressed glutamate-induced decrease in cellular ATP level and
  also attenuated neuronal cell death via mTOR signaling pathway. Dotted lines indicate
  pathways that are still obscure whether they are direct or indirect effects. The
  effects of Mg2+ demonstrated previous studies are shown in blue, and the main excitotoxic
  signals are shown in green.
