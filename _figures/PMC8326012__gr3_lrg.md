caption: Intracellular synthesis and accumulation of polyP; partially hypothetical
  scheme. (a) Blood platelets are the major stores of polyP. This polymer is presumably
  synthesized in megakaryocytes, from where the platelets originate by cytoplasmic
  fragmentation. (b) In mitochondria ATP is produced from reducing equivalents that
  accumulate during the metabolism of glucose, fatty acids, amino acids and pyruvate,
  like in the citric acid cycle. The reducing equivalents formed (NADH, FADH2) drive
  the electron transport chain at the inner mitochondrial membrane, followed by an
  export of the protons into the intermembranous space. From there the protons are
  rechanneled via the inner mitochondrial membrane and thereby drive the ATP production
  by ATP synthase. Finally, ATP releases the mitochondrion via the adenine nucleotide
  translocase (ANT; inner mitochondrial membrane) and the voltage-dependent anion
  channels (VDAC; outer mitochondrial membrane) into the cytoplasm. Adjacent to the
  mitochondria are the acidocalcisomes. In the membranes of these organelles, the
  Vtc complex is located with its subunits 1–4, where, in budding yeast, polyP is
  polymerized and pressed into the lumen of the organelle. In vertebrates this pathway
  is unknown. Adapted with permission . Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.
