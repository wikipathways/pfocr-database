caption: Isobutyrate confers resistance to inflammatory bowel disease through host–microbiota
  interactions in pigs. Isobutyrate levels are significantly decreased in CD patients
  (A) and DSS-induced colitis of mice and pigs (B and C), and supplementation with
  isobutyrate alleviates colitis in piglets. Mechanistically, isobutyrate can increase
  the relative abundance of L. reuteri, thereby increasing the production of indole-3-lactic
  acid, regulating aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression and downstream signaling pathways,
  and regulating Foxp3+ CD4+ T-cell recruitment to alleviate colitis. Isobutyrate
  can directly activate G protein-coupled receptor 109A, promote the expression of
  Claudin-1, and improve intestinal barrier function. In addition, isobutyrate can
  increase the production of intestinal SCFAs and 3-hydroxybutyric acid and inhibit
  the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway to suppress intestinal inflammation. In conclusion,
  our findings demonstrate that isobutyrate confers resistance to IBD through host–microbiota
  interactions, providing a theoretical basis for the use of isobutyrate in alleviating
  colitis (created with Biorender.com)
