caption: Effect of physical activity and obesity on the growth and development of
  colon carcinogenesis. Vigorous physical activity had been shown to induce the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to DNA-adduct formation, potentially affecting
  the initiation of colorectal cancer (CRC). Alternatively, moderate physical exercise
  has been shown to induce an innate immune response through IL-6 receptor activation
  and downstream protein up regulation. This adaptive immune response protects the
  organisms against chronic inflammatory conditions, which are known to increase the
  risk of CRC development. Further, moderate physical activity has been shown to inhibit
  the expression of other inflammatory mediators, such as iNOS, which may play a role
  in chronic inflammatory conditions. Moderate physical activity has been also shown
  to alter specific hormones that are related to appetite and satiety signals; these
  hormones include YY, GLP-1, and PP, all of which are involved in glycogen secretion.
  Practicing moderate physical activity also results in the up regulation of superoxide
  dismutase (SOD); this enzyme further activates detoxification pathways via up regulation
  of the Nrf2 proteins and GSTs enzymes. Additionally, SOD inhibits PPAR-α leading
  to the reduced expression of VEGF, which is involved in the promotion and progression
  of CRC. Obesity is a result of an energy imbalance that results in aberrant activation
  of various receptor proteins involved in inflammation, proliferation, and hormone
  regulation. This abnormal activation creates an environment that is chronically
  inflamed and can result in the initiation, promotion and progression of CRC. One
  of the major inflammatory mediators is TNF-α, which is activated at the cell membrane,
  resulting in downstream protein cascade activation. TNF-α activation can result
  in induction of NFκB and COX-2 signaling which initiates an inflammatory response.
  Additionally, the TNF-α receptor pathway can trigger activation of the GSK3β enzyme;
  this enzyme regulates numerous proteins, including β-catenin and NFκB. β-catenin
  further regulates other proteins that are involved CRC development; these proteins
  include C-myc, cyclin D, and VEGF, which are involved in oncogene signaling, cell
  cycle regulation, and metastatic development. Adiponectin is another factor that
  is highly expressed in obese individuals, which has been shown to increase glucose
  uptake and fatty acid oxidation; once the adiponectin receptor is activated it results
  in PKA kinase upregulation, which further inhibits NFκB in adipocytes. This inhibition
  ultimately leads to down regulation of cell adhesion molecules that are important
  regulators of CRC promotion and progression. Insulin signaling is another important
  pathway that is chronically up regulated in obese individuals; binding of insulin
  to its receptor triggers a conformational change that results in the activation
  of downstream kinase targets such as, PI3K. PI3K has the ability to trigger PKB
  kinase activation, which ultimately results in increased glycogen secretion and
  decreased gluconeogenesis; alternatively PI3K can activate the JAK protein kinase,
  which plays a role in immune function and inflammatory responses. Another factor
  that has been shown to activate the JAK protein is leptin; this factor is secreted
  from adipose tissue and in addition to activating JAK it has also been shown to
  activate the MAPK signaling cascade. Furthermore, both JAK and MAPK signaling pathways
  are involved in the regulation of proliferative and metastatic associated molecules,
  such as PCNA and VEGF; both of which are important regulators of CRC promotion and
  progression. The illustration also denotes the modulatory role of lifestyle interventions
  at various levels on these aberrant signaling pathways. The photographs of lifestyle
  interventions were sourced and adapted from http://www.freedigitalphotos.net/.
