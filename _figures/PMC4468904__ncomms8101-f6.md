caption: Only nutrients and disease classes with at least one marginally enriched
  nutrient-class interaction (hypergeometric P<0.1) are shown. (a) Using the metabolic
  network reconstruction Recon 1, side effect-specific metabolic perturbations (DISLoDGED
  pathways) are grouped into nutrient domains to enable comparison with existing disease-related
  genetic, clinical and pre-clinical data to assess the potential causality of observed
  perturbations. In this figure, the number of side effects with an upregulation in
  the production pathway for a metabolite is shown in yellow boxes, whereas blue boxes
  show the number of side effects with a downregulation in the production pathway
  for a metabolite. (b) Downregulated DISLoDGED pathways. Nutrient-disease class interactions
  indicating an enrichment of downregulations in drugs causing side effects within
  the class are coloured according to the legend. (c) Upregulated DISLoDGED pathways.
  Nutrient–disease class interactions indicating an enrichment of upregulations in
  drugs causing side effects within the class are coloured according to the legend.
  Many of the enriched interactions are consistent with known effects of nutrient/pathway
  perturbation on the corresponding disease classes and physiological systems.
