caption: Multiple roles of two cell cycle checkpoint pathways (ATM/CHK2/TP53 and ATR/CHK1/WEE1)
  and PARP1 in the DNA damage response (DDR) and replication stress (RS) response.
  a ATM is stimulated by a few activators or via autophosphorylation through a feedback
  loop. ATM activates CHK2, which subsequently phosphorylates TP53 and CDC25A, leading
  to inhibition of CDK2/cyclin E and CDK1/cyclin B and impairment of G1/S phase transition.
  b Major trigger for ATR is stalled replication fork or resected DSB. The activation
  of ATR requires RPA-coated ssDNA, ETAA1, and TopBP1. Then, ATR mediates CHK1 phosphorylation,
  suppressing CDC25A and CDC25B and stimulating WEE1 activity. Alternatively, WEE1
  inhibits CDC25C by phosphorylating CDC25C. The inactivation of the CDC family causes
  CDK2 and CDK1 incompetence, resulting in G2/M phase arrest. c PARP 1 senses single-strand
  DNA breaks and catalyzes other prominent members and itself through PARPylation,
  participating in BER, SSBR, and NER. Finally, poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG)
  and PARylation itself release PARP1 from SSB sites. Similarly, PARP1 senses DSBs
  and recruits ATM, MRE11 and BRCA proteins to repair DNA strands via HR or facilitates
  MMEJ repair pathway activation in the absence of BRCA. d PARP1 plays key roles in
  fork reversal, fork protection and fork restart during the repair of stalled replication
  forks. PARP1 Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1; DDR DNA damage response; RS Replication
