caption: Model for the function of SHC-1 in IIS and JNK signaling. Upon DAF-2 activation,
  AGE-1 and PIP3 activate PDK-1 and the downstream kinase complex AKT-1/AKT-2/SGK-1.
  The transcription factor DAF-16 is directly inhibited and phosphorylated via activity
  of the IIS pathway, a function of which is induction of stress response and longevity
  genes. In addition, DAF-16 integrates positive signals via JNK signaling stimulating
  nuclear accumulation. Genetic and biochemical analyses presented here suggest that
  SHC-1 opposes IIS upstream of AGE-1 and DAF-2 and directly interacts with DAF-2.
  Furthermore, SHC-1 activates JNK signaling and interacts with MEK-1 to control life
  span and response against heat, oxidation, and heavy metals.
