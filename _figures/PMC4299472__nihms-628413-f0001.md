caption: Schematic diagram demonstrating the role of RKIP in the regulation of tumor
  cell drug/immune resistance (black lines). Tumor cells exhibit a constitutively
  hyperactivated NF-κB pathway which regulates, in large part, the survival, growth,
  metastasis and resistance of tumor cells. Among many target genes that NF-κB regulates,
  there exists a dysregulated NF-κB/Snail/YY1/PTEN/RKIP loop that is responsible,
  in part, for NF-κB-mediated above tumor manifestations. The hyperactivated NF-κB
  pathway regulates cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic pathways, EMT, metastasis and
  resistance. These events are the results of NF-κB activation of (1) the metastasis
  inducer and resistance transcription factor Snail, which regulates CSCs, EMT and
  anti-apoptotic pathways and (2) the drug/immune resistant transcription factor YY1,
  which also regulates the transcription of Snail. The overexpression of Snail results
  in the repression of the metastasis suppressor/drug sensitizers, RKIP and PTEN.
  The repression of RKIP minimally represses the NF-κB pathway directly and indirectly
  by the repression of PTEN, which does not inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway that regulates
  NF-κB. Overall, the tumor cells exhibit a dysregulated NF-κB /Snail/YY1/PTEN/RKIP
  loop with the overexpression of NF-κB, Snail and YY1 and under expression of RKIP
  and PTEN and resulting in tumor cell survival, metastasis and drug resistance (red
  lines). Inhibition of the dysregulated loop products, on each of the overexpressed
  NF-κB, YY1, Snail, PI3K/AKT, results in the derepression of RKIP and PTEN and resulting
  in the inhibition of cell growth, survival, EMT, metastasis, and activation of proapoptotic
  pathways resulting in sensitization to drug-induced apoptosis. There are many classes
  of inhibitors that may be used and some examples are illustrated in the scheme,
  for instance, the expression of the active form of RKIP in its phosphorylated form
  can be rendered active by the use of phosphatase inhibitors. Inhibitors of NF-κB
  will have both direct and indirect effects on NF-κB target genes such as Snail and
  YY1 and derepression of RKIP and PTEN. The direct inhibition of Snail and YY1 will
  have similar effects as the NF-κB inhibitors. Likewise, inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT
  pathway will have direct and indirect effects on the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway
  and its targets Snail and YY1.
