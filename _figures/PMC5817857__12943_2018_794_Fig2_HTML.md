caption: Schematic representation of an RTK and the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. PI3K
  is activated downstream of RTKs by two mechanisms. First, a phosphorylated tyrosine
  residue on the receptor serves as a docking site for the p85 regulatory subunit
  of PI3K recruiting the catalytic subunit of PI3K, p110, to the plasma membrane.
  Second, activated RAS downstream of the RTK induces the membrane translocation and
  activation of the p110 subunit of PI3K. Activated PI3K converts PIP2 into PIP3,
  which is a docking site for PDK1 and AKT. AKT is then phosphorylated on Thr308 by
  PDK1 and on Ser473 by the mTOR kinase from the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC2 is
  defined by its scaffold protein RICTOR and promotes the stability and activation
  of AKT, SGK and PKC. AKT activates downstream signals involved in cell proliferation,
  differentiation, survival and migration
