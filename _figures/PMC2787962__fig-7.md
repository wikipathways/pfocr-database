caption: Aggregatory mechanism of α-syn. The probable mechanism by which α-syn aggregates.
  In normal cells, α-syn exists in an unfolded and monomeric state, and through disease-associated
  mechanisms, transitions to a toxic protofibril capable of damaging intracellular
  membranes. Neuroprotective mechanisms may serve to clear protofibrils by refolding
  the aggregates back to a monomeric state or by clearing them through the lysosomal
  or proteasomal degradation pathway. Protofibrils may further oligomerize into fibril
  structures that ultimately are organized into Lewy bodies. The relation between
  Lewy bodies and cell death remains unclear.
