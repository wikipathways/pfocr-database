caption: SLC7A11 is regulated by transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational
  mechanisms. Under stress conditions, such as oxidative stress and amino acid deficiency,
  the GCN2-eIF2α and KEAP1-NRF2 signal axes can induce SLC7A11 transcription, and
  the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex can further promote the NRF2-mediated transcriptional
  activation of SLC7A11. However, p53 and ATF3 inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 under
  basal conditions. In epigenetics, the methylation of H3K4 can activate the transcription
  of SLC7A11, whereas the methylation of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 can inhibit the transcription
  activity of SLC7A11. BRD4 can inhibit the transcription of SLC7A11 by regulating
  histone acetylation. The stability of SLC7A11 mRNA can be regulated by microRNA.
  miR-139-5p, mir-27a, and mir-375 can destroy the stability of SLC7A11 mRNA and inhibit
  its transcription. mTORC2 can regulate the phosphorylation of SLC7A11 at serine
  site 26 and inhibit the transport activity of SLC7A11 directly or through the AKT
  signaling pathway. CD44v and OTUB1 can inhibit the degradation of SLC7A11, thereby
  stabilizing the SLC7A11 protein and improving its transport activity. GCN2, general
  control nonderepressible 2; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α; KEAP1, kelch-like
