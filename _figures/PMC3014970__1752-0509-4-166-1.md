caption: Effect of specific growth rate on acetate synthesis and utilization pathways,
  selected TCA cycle and carbon catabolite repressed gene and protein expression levels
  in E. coli A-stat experiments. PTA, phosphotransacetylase; ACKA, acetate kinase;
  ACS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; POXB, pyruvate oxidase; PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; GS, glyoxylate shunt; Crp, cyclic AMP receptor
  protein; Cra, catabolite repressor activator; Icd, isocitrate dehydrogenase; SucD,
  succinyl-CoA synthethase; SdhB, succinate dehydrogenase; μ, specific growth rate
  (h-1). Thickness of red arrows denotes level of ACS and PTA-ACKA pathway repression
  (thick line represents stronger repression). Protein data points are average of
  two independent experiments, error bars are not shown for better visualization.
  Gene names are italicized. Refer to Additional file 2 for standard deviations and
  all the data.
