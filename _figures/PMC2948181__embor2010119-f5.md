caption: The Pup proteasome system is regulated by opposing activities. (A) Deamidation
  and depupylation performed by Dop are chemically similar reactions whereby water
  attacks the γ-carboxyl of Pup, leading to the release of ammonia in the case of
  deamidation or of a substrate lysine in the case of depupylation. (B) Schematic
  showing the proposed cycle of pupylation and depupylation in mycobacteria. Pup is
  shown as a red oval with indicated glutamine or glutamate C-terminus, and the substrate
  protein is depicted in grey carrying the label ‘K-Sub' to highlight the linkage
  through a lysine residue. Dop and PafA are depicted as green and brown shapes, respectively.
  Dop, deamidase of Pup; Pup, prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein.
