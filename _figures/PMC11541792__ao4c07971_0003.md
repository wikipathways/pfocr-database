caption: A proposed model in this study showing an overview of the abnormal flavonol
  accumulation and root development observed upon lydicamycin treatment. Lydicamycin
  enters root cells through diffusion, initiating an aberrant synthesis of isorhamnetin.
  The cell diagram illustrates the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids, although the
  precise molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Following its synthesis, isorhamnetin
  diffuses and undergoes vesicular trafficking between cells, potentially interacting
  with PIN proteins. This interaction perturbs the polar transport of auxin, resulting
  in its accumulation in pericycle cells. Subsequent auxin build up stimulates lateral
  root growth
