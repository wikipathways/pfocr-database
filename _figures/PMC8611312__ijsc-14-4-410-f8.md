caption: Graphic abstract. Working model of how p53 enhances more cardiomyocytes generation
  from hiPSC. During the period from HiPSC to mesendoderm, p53 activates the Wnt signaling
  pathway through transactivating WNT3 expression which boosts mesendodermal differentiation,
  and finally yields more cardiomyocytes generation.
