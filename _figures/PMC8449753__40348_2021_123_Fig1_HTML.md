caption: Regulators of FGF23 in CKD. a Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 is expressed
  and secreted in the bone by osteocytes and osteoblasts. b In CKD, enhanced parathyroid
  hormone (PTH) levels stimulate the transcription of FGF23 by binding to PTH 1 receptor
  (PTH1R) activating protein kinase A (PKA)/nuclear receptor related-1 (Nurr1) signaling
  pathway. In addition, PTH-mediated PKA activation inhibits sclerostin that leads
  to induction of the Wnt pathway following FGF23 mRNA expression. Treatment with
  1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25OHD) in CKD patients upregulates FGF23 transcription
  via binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer complex
  that translocates into the nucleus and activates vitamin D response elements (VDRE)
  in the FGF23 gene. Furthermore, FGF23 transcription is stimulated by calcium-dependent
  nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling pathway leading to induction
  of NFAT response elements in the FGF23 promotor. High phosphate induces polypeptide
  n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GalNt3), thereby stabilizing intact FGF23 (iFGF23)
  protein on the post-translational level. Iron deficiency and inflammation stabilize
  hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF1α) that bind to HIF-binding sites in the FGF23
  promotor stimulating its transcriptional activity. Moreover, HIF1α mediates the
  cleavage of FGF23 protein through erythropoietin (EPO), while EPO itself enhances
  FGF23 transcription. The increase in CKD-related inflammatory factors stimulates
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) mediating
  FGF23 transcription through Orai1 activation. Created with BioRender.com
