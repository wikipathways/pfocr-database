caption: Inflammatory functions of uPAR and suPAR. Upon an inflammatory stimulus,
  e.g., stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) or cytokine receptors, the expression
  of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in immunologically active cells
  is increased via activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP1), which bind to the promoter
  region of the PLAUR gene. The uPAR mRNA is either degraded (by p53) or stabilized
  for translation (by HuR or hnRNPC), after which uPAR is expressed at the cell surface,
  bound to the membrane via a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. At the cell
  surface, uPAR can become cleaved by various proteases or its own ligand urokinase
  plasminogen activator (uPA), thus generating suPAR, which plays a role in inflammation
  by impairing neutrophil efferocytosis and stimulating angiogenesis and chemotaxis.
  Active uPA cleaves plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn cleaves and activates uPA.
  Plasmin activates matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), cleaves extracellular matrix (ECM)
  components, degrades fibrin, and activates the classical complement pathway, thereby
  promoting migration and invasion of cells, fibrinolysis, vasodilation, opsonization,
  and phagocytosis of foreign pathogens. Co-localization of uPAR with the proteins
  cytokeratin-1 (CK1) and globular C1q receptor (gC1qR) on the surface of endothelial
  cells also promotes vasodilation through release of bradykinin via activation of
  kallikrein. In a complex with β2 integrin and gC1qR, uPAR also induces release of
  cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα) and chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1), upon stimulation by
  cleaved high molecular weight kininogen (HKa). Cytokines stimulate the production
  of C-reactive protein (CRP) from the liver, and CRP itself functions as an opsonin
  and also activates the classical complement pathway. Furthermore, uPAR interacts
  with vitronectin, fibrinogen, and integrins, mainly αMβ2 integrin (Mac-1) but also
  β1 and β3 integrin complexes, activating intracellular signaling pathways that facilitate
  cell adhesion, migration, invasion, proliferation, and survival by affecting F-actin
  assembly and gene transcription. The activity of uPA and plasmin is inhibited by
  plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, PAI-2, and α2-antiplasmin. Binding of PAI-1
  and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) mediates endocytosis
  of uPAR-uPA-PAI-1 complexes, followed by lysosomal degradation of uPA and PAI-1
  and recycling of uPAR back to the membrane. In endothelial cells, co-localization
  of uPAR with CK1 and gC1qR activates kallikrein and promotes the release of the
  vasodilator bradykinin. hnRNPC, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C; HuR,
