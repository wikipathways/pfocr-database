caption: Graphic illustration shows the structure of PLGA@BP-R848 NPs and its application
  in cancer immunotherapy. PLGA@BP-R848 NPs constructed by PLGA, BP, and R848, are
  introduced into tumor tissues and exposed to 808 nm NIR laser irradiation. Upon
  generating photothermal effects, these PLGA@BP-R848 NPs initiate the mitochondrial
  apoptotic signaling pathway (Blc-2-Bax-Cytochrome c-caspase-3), thereby hindering
  the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway responsible for cell growth regulation. The
  ICD induced by PLGA@BP-R848 NPs stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs),
  activates T cells, and promotes the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS).
  Furthermore, the combination of DCs primed with mGPC3pp enhances the efficacy of
  cancer immunotherapy
