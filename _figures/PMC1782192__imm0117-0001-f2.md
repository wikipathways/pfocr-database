caption: Direct and indirect activation of human natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells
  receive activation signals via a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms. A number
  of events occur in a virally infected cell which affect NK cells. Viral protein
  is processed by the antigen-processing pathway and viral peptide is presented on
  the surface of the infected cell in the context of human leucoyte antigen (HLA)
  class I. The altered peptide presented may result in perturbation of an inhibitory
  signal through a killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) to the NK cell, resulting
  in its activation. KIRs are also sensitive to the loss of HLA class I from the cell
  surface, a mechanism used by some viruses to escape cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)
  recognition. Type 1 interferon (IFN) is produced by virally infected cells, and
  this is a potent cytokine in terms of activating NK cell effector functions such
  as cytotoxicity. Viral antigen, for example haemagglutinin (HA), expressed at the
  infected cell surface can directly engage NK cell activatory receptors such as NKp46.
  Direct recognition of viral pathogen can also occur through sensing of viral replication
  products, for example double-stranded (ds) RNA, through cell surface Toll-like receptor
  3 (TLR3). Viral replication products such as single-stranded (ss) and dsRNA can
  also indirectly activate NK cells by interaction with appropriate TLRs on accessory
  cells, with resultant production of NK cell stimulatory cytokines such as interleukin
  (IL)-12. Some similar mechanisms exist in tumour cell recognition, including down-regulation
  of HLA class I to escape from CTLs which can then result in NK cell activation.
  Different mechanisms involved include induction of stress antigens, for example
  MICA and MICB, which activate NK cell effector functions through NKG2D. NK cells
  thus receive a number of signals dependent on the immunological challenge, which
  can be both direct and indirect (see above), and it is the balance of these that
  culminates in the final NK cell response.

  description: Direct and indirect activation of human natural killer (NK) cells.
    NK cells receive activation signals via a variety of direct and indirect mechanisms.
    A number of events occur in a virally infected cell which affect NK cells. Viral
    protein is processed by the antigen-processing pathway and viral peptide is presented
    on the surface of the infected cell in the context of human leucoyte antigen (HLA)
    class I. The altered peptide presented may result in perturbation of an inhibitory
    signal through a killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) to the NK cell, resulting
    in its activation. KIRs are also sensitive to the loss of HLA class I from the
    cell surface, a mechanism used by some viruses to escape cytotoxic T lymphocyte
    (CTL) recognition. Type 1 interferon (IFN) is produced by virally infected cells,
    and this is a potent cytokine in terms of activating NK cell effector functions
    such as cytotoxicity. Viral antigen, for example haemagglutinin (HA), expressed
