caption: Overview of TLR4 signalling in hypertension and potential therapeutic targets.
  Activation of TLR4 by hypertensive stimuli, such as DAMPs, may involve a primary
  interaction with MD2. Stimulated TLR4 initiates the early MyD88‐dependent phase
  and late TRIF‐dependent phase cascades. In the MyD88‐dependent pathway, TIRAP associates
  with the receptor TIR domain, facilitating MyD88 association. MyD88 then recruits
  and activates IRAKs, leading to sequential stimulation of TRAF6 and TAK1. The downstream
  MAPK and IKK pathways ultimately result in the nuclear translocation of activator
  protein 1 (AP‐1) and NF‐κB transcription factors and production of pro‐inflammatory
  mediators. In the delayed TRIF‐dependent phase, recruitment of TRAM to the TIR domain
  allows TRIF binding, which up‐regulates IRF3 expression through TRAF3. TRAM recruitment
  also leads to NF‐κB activation through RIPK1 (RIP1). Although NF‐κB expression is
  shown to be increased in animal models of hypertension, it has not yet been determined
  whether RIPK1 activation is involved in hypertension (a), nor is the exact mechanism
  of RIPK1‐mediated NF‐κB activation fully understood (b). TLR4 stimulation also activates
  NADPH oxidase, increasing ROS production and thus ROS‐induced NF‐κB translocation.
  As a result of these signalling pathways, TLR4 stimulation causes the up‐regulation
  of pro‐inflammatory mediators, such as TNFα, IL‐6 and IL‐1β. Several molecules have
  been developed that inhibit TLR4 signalling and may be beneficial in hypertension
  management. Eritoran, tested in sepsis patients, binds to the pocket of the MD2
  adaptor protein (1). NI‐0101 inhibits both exogenous and endogenous bindings and
  is currently in a phase III clinical trial for rheumatoid arthritis (2). TAK‐242
  binds to the TIR domain of TLR4 and has been tested in clinical trial for sepsis
  (3). ST2825 inhibits the dimerization of MyD88, thus halting the MyD88‐dependent
  pathway (4). Other drugs (not shown here) have been developed that inhibit TLR4
  binding of AngII, while several decrease TLR4 signalling through unknown mechanisms.
  Suggested therapeutic targets within the TLR4 signalling cascades are highlighted
  above (A–D) and discussed throughout the review.
