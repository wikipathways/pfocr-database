caption: Shown are the two metabolic pathways for GDP‐L‐fucose synthesis by the salvage
  and de novo pathways. In the salvage pathway, fucose obtained from diet or lysosomal
  degradation is converted to GDP‐fucose in two steps by L‐fucose kinase (FCSK) followed
  by fucose‐1‐phosphate guanylyltransferase (FPGT). In the de novo synthesis, which
  is responsible for most of the GDP‐fucose yielded, GDP‐fucose is obtained from GDP‐D‐mannose.
  The enzymes involved are GDP‐D‐mannose‐4,6‐dehydratase (GMDS) and GDP‐L‐fucose synthase
  (GFUS). GDP‐fucose is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to
  the Golgi by transporters SLC35C2 and SLC35C1, respectively. Genes with previously
  described disease‐causing mutations are indicated by their respective MIM numbers.
