caption: Ferroptosis in CSCs. The role of ferroptosis in CSCs is controversial. First,
  enzymes and transporters in the ferroptosis pathway are altered in some CSCs, including
  sterol regulatory-element binding protein 1 (STEAP1), divalent metal transporter
  protein 1 (DMT1), and nuclear receptor coactivator (NOCA4). The ferritin heavy chain
  (FTH) is downregulated in CSCs. The absence of FTH induces the expression of stemness-related
  genes, microRNA-150 (miR-150), and miR-46a, which maintain the stemness of CSCs.
  FTH also inhibits the activation of CXCR4/CXCL2 signaling and subsequent NF-κB-mediated
  EMT directly or by blocking ROS-regulated HIF-1α. A high level of SLC7A11, which
  is promoted by heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27)-mediated inhibition of p53, protects
  CSCs from ferroptosis via the GSH/GPX4 axis. Moreover, lnc-ENDOG-1:1 (lncFERO) secreted
  by CSCs interacts with stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD1) mRNA and recruits hnRNPA1
  to facilitate the translation of SCD1. SCD1 inhibits PUFA synthesis and thereby
  curbs ferroptosis. SCD1 is also inhibited by FTH in CSCs
