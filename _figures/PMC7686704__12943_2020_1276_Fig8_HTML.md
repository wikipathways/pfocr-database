caption: Wnt signaling in breast cancer drug resistance. a Wnt signaling-induced tumoral
  heterogeneity involves the drug resistance of breast cancer. b The APC transporters
  P-gp (encoded by ABCB1) and BCRP (encoded by ABCG2), which are involved in drug
  efflux, are targets of Wnt signaling in breast cancer. c Wnt signaling involves
  endocrine resistance in breast cancer. The thickness of the arrow represents the
  relative contribution of each pathway to the overall oxidation of tamoxifen (adapted
  from [])
