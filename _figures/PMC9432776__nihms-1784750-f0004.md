caption: 'NosP and TCS pathways in various organisms. NosP, like H-NOX, is encoded
  in genes that are co-cistronic with HK-encoding genes. A) In L. pneumophila, LpgNahK
  exhibits basal autokinase activity when bound to FeII-unligated LpgNosP. This leads
  to a basal LpgNarR activities - although both activities are detectable, DGC activity
  dominates. FeII-NO LpgNosP leads to increased LpgNahK autophosphorylation and increased
  phosphoryl flux to LpgNarR. This results in the upregulation of PDE activity and
  the downregulation of DGC activity, which together, leads to decreased local c-di-GMP
  levels. B) In V. cholerae, a quorum sensing pathway is regulated by VcNosP. In the
  presence of FeII-unligated VcNosP, VpsS displays kinase autophosphorylation activity,
  thus directing phosphoryl flux towards LuxU and LuxO. Phosphorylated LuxO leads
  to the expression of regulatory small RNAs (Qrrs 1-4) and (indirectly) the expression
  of vps genes, which eventually leads to virulence and biofilm formation, respectively.
  In the presence of FeII-NO VcNosP, the autokinase activity of VpsS is inhibited;
  instead, the phosphatase activity is promoted and causes a reversed phosphoryl flux
  from LuxO to LuxU. Dephosphorylated LuxO does not allow the RNAs and the vps genes
  to be expressed and thus, curtails virulence and biofilm formation. Key: Bold arrows
  means upregulated activity while grey arrows indicate downregulated activity. The
  phosphatase activity of VpsS is labeled in blue. Abbreviations: TCS, two-component
  system; NahK, NosP-associated histidine kinase; Hpt, histidine phosphotransferase
  domain; NarR, NosP-associated response regulator; GGDEF, diguanylate cyclase domain
  motif; EAL, phosphodiesterase domain motif; HTH, helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain.'
