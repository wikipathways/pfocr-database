caption: Steps that regulate ADAMTS protease expression and activity. ADAMTS proteases
  can be regulated transcriptionally, during mRNA splicing or translation into protein.
  Major posttranslational regulatory steps include furin-mediated activation of ADAMTS
  proteases and the localization of ADAMTS protease activity in the pericellular or
  extracellular matrix. In addition, re-uptake of active ADAMTS proteases mediated
  by LRP1 results in the localization of ADAMTS protease activity to intracellular
  compartments, such as the primary cilium or the nucleus or in the clearance of protease
  activity from the extracellular matrix. Cellular and extracellular compartments
  are labeled in blue and points of regulation in red. Some ADAMTS proteases discussed
  in the review are depicted. Exceptions, such as activation of ADAMTS proteases in
  the secretory pathway or the ECM or absence of furin processing are described in
  the text only.
