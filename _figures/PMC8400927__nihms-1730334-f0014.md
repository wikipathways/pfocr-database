caption: Circle plot showing the number of statistically significant intercellular
  signalling interactions for total signalling (over 30 ligand–receptor pathways)
  and the complement family of molecules in control individuals (non-viral and influenza)
  compared to patients with COVID-19 (permutation test, CellChat; n = 8 control, including
  influenza; n = 8 COVID-19 for cortex; and n = 7 control, including influenza; n
  = 7 COVID-19 for choroid plexus). Each circle (colour) represents one cell type,
  and edges connecting circles represent significant intercellular signalling inferred
  between those cell types. Circles and edges were normalized and scaled to display
  relative sizes, with the former proportional to the number of cells from a given
  cell type and the latter according to the inferred strength of signalling. Cell
  type labels correspond to signalling pathway increased in COVID-19.
