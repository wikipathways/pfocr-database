caption: 'Impact of AMXT 1501 on ATP synthase and glycolysis. AMXT 1501 significantly
  inhibits adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. This is manifested by a pronounced
  downregulation of genes (shown in red) associated with the ATP synthase system,
  including SPD1334, SPD1337, SPD1338, SPD1339, and SPD1340, which encode essential
  components of the F0F1 ATP synthase subunits. The ATP synthase system, responsible
  for generating ATP from the transmembrane proton gradient, experiences significant
  suppression. In the glycolytic pathway, key enzymes encoded by SPD1823, SPD0445,
  SPD1468, and SPD1012, involved in converting glucose to pyruvate, are notably downregulated.
  These enzymes play a crucial role in ATP production during glycolysis. Observed
  changes in gene expression appear to be under the regulation of the two-component
  regulatory system (CiaRH: SPD0701 (3.7)/SPD0702 (3.9))'
