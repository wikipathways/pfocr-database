caption: 'Contribution of type III effectors to proteasome-dependent protein degradation.
  (A) Model of the proteasome-dependent protein degradation pathway. Ubiquitin (Ub)
  is activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and transferred to the ubiquitin-conjugating
  enzyme (E2), which interacts with the ubiquitin ligase (E3). E3 ubiquitin ligases
  are divided into several classes according to the presence of a HECT, RING or U-box
  domain. RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases can be part of a multimeric
  protein complex such as the SCF complex, which consists of a RING-box protein, the
  molecular scaffold protein cullin, an Arabidopsis SKP1-like protein (ASK1) and an
  F-box protein, which binds the substrate of the E3 ligase. E3 enzymes mediate the
  transfer of ubiquitin molecules to the substrate, thus leading to the formation
  of poly-ubiquitin chains, which allow the targeting of proteins to the proteasome.
  The proteasome consists of two 19S regulatory and a 20S core particle and catalyzes
  the unfolding and degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins. (B) Domain structure
  of the effector protein AvrPtoB from P. syringae. The regions of AvrPtoB, which
  provide binding sites for the AvrPtoB interaction partners Pto, Bti9, Fen, FLS2
  and BAK1, are indicated. References: (1) Dong et al. ; (2) Xiao et al. ; (3) Mathieu,

  for the presence of two Pto-binding sites in AvrPtoB (indicated as orange boxes)
  was reported by Mathieu, Schwizer and Martin (). Numbers refer to amino acid positions
  in AvrPtoB. (C) HopM1 from P. syringae induces the degradation of its interaction
  partner AtMIN7. The HopM1-mediated degradation of AtMIN7 depends on the activity
  of the proteasome. (D) The effector protein XopL from X. campestris pv. vesicatoria
  triggers the ubiquitination of plant proteins. XopL contains an N-terminal LRR and
  a C-terminal E3 ubiquitin ligase domain. The plant targets of XopL are unknown.
  Numbers refer to amino acid positions in XopL. (E) GALA proteins from R. solancearum
  contain an F-box domain and were proposed to associate with components of the SCF
  complex. In agreement with this hypothesis, an interaction between GALA proteins
  and ASK proteins has been shown. A contribution of GALA proteins to the ubiquitination
  of substrates of the SCF complex remains to be demonstrated. (F) XopJ from Xanthomonas
  spp. and HopZ4 from P. syringae interact with the proteasome subunit RPT6 and suppress
  the activity of the proteasome. XopJ leads to the degradation of RPT6. (G) XopP
  from X. oryzae pv. oryzae interacts with the U box E3 ubiquitin ligase PUB44 from
  rice and inhibits its activity.'
