caption: Potential mechanism by which SynGAP regulates light entrainment capacity
  in the SCN. In this model, photic input drives glutamate release from retinohypothalamic
  (RHT) nerve terminals, which triggers Gefs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors)-mediated
  exchange of GDP for GTP in Ras. In its activated, GTP-loaded, form, Ras stimulates
  MAPK pathway activation. By stimulating the conversion of GTP to GDP, SynGAP functions
  as a negative regulator of this glutamate/RAS/MAPK signaling cassette. This negative
  regulatory effect of SynGAP can be reduced via its phosphorylation by CaMKII, which
  leads to its dispersion from dendritic spines. In Syngap1 heterozygous mice, a reduced
  level of negative regulation of Ras GTP hydrolysis is predicted to trigger prolonged
  light-evoked Ras signaling, which in turn, would lead to enhanced MAPK activity
  (either peak levels or duration of activation). Potential mechanisms by which enhanced
  MAPK signaling leads to an increase in light-evoked clock entrainment are listed
