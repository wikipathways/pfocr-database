caption: Schematic model illustrating the signaling pathway through which TBK1 inhibits
  TNF-α–induced apoptosis (red arrows) and the parallel pathway involving IKK-mediated
  NF-κB activation (black arrows). Engagement of TNFR1 triggers proapoptotic and survival
  signals through assembly of distinct multiprotein signaling platforms (DISK complexes).
  Heterodimeric cFLIP:caspase-8 complexes recruited to the DISK prevent cell death
  unless cFLIP is inactivated or degraded, allowing caspase-8 to induce apoptosis.
  The survival response is mediated through activation of TBK1 and IKK, both of which
  are required for NF-κB activation. Although TBK1 is dispensable for IκB phosphorylation
  and NF-κB–mediated induction of most antiapoptotic genes (i.e., TBK1-independent
  genes), it regulates the activation of Pai-2 and Tg2 (i.e., TBK1-dependent genes),
  whose expression requires RelA/p65 phosphorylation. Cytosolic PAI-2 associates with
  TG2, preventing its degradation. Calcium (Ca2+)-activated TG2 accumulates in the
  cytosol and cross-links procaspase-3 into inactive dimers that are degraded. This
  process inhibits apoptosis by depleting the pool of procaspase-3 available for activation
  by caspase-8.
