caption: Biophysical forces regulate TGFβ superfamily signaling at multiple points
  in the pathway. A, Both passive and active mechanical cues alter gene expression
  of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands and mothers against decapentaplegic
  homolog (SMAD) effector proteins. B, Membrane tension generated by mechanical interactions
  with the extracellular matrix (ECM) drives TGFβ receptor endocytosis. C, TGFβ ligands
  are sequestered by the ECM through interactions with latency-associated protein
  (LAP) and latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP). Cell contraction initiates ligand
  release by unfolding mechanosensitive LAP to interfere with LAP–TGFβ binding.
