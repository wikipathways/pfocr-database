caption: 'The roles of kynurenine pathway metabolites, pantethine and α-lipoic acid
  in glycolysis and TCA cycle. PDH is the link between glycolysis and the TCA cycle.
  α-lipoic acid functions as a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase. The kynurenine
  pathway of TRP metabolism ultimately leads to the formation of NAD+, which will
  be reduced to NADH. Pantethine is a precursor in the formation of CoA, which functions
  as an acetyl carrier. It transfers acetyl groups from pyruvate to oxaloacetate,
  initiating the TCA cycle. Abbreviations: TRP: tryptophan; KYNA: kynurenic acid;
  QUIN: quinolinic acid; NAD+: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; CoA: coenzyme A;
  TCA: tricarboxylic acid; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase.'
