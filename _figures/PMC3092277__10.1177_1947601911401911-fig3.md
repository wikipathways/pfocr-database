caption: Schematic of nuclear signaling by the YAP/TAZ and estrogen receptor complex.
  YAP and its ligand, WBP-2, were shown to be a part of the E6-AP and ER-E (estrogen
  receptor - estrogen) complex and are required for estrogen-mediated gene expression.
  The nuclear signaling of this multicomponent complex may identify targets for the
  development of cancer drugs. Other abbreviations are described in the text.
