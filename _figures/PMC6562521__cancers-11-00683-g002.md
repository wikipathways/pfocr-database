caption: 'Schematic representation of the consequences of tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle disruption in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL). Upon disruption
  of the activity of pivotal TCA cycle enzymes, there is an accumulation of metabolites
  (i.e., succinate, fumarate, D2HG and L2HG). Their efflux from the mitochondria to
  the cytosol and their subsequent competition with α-ketoglutarate lead to the inhibition
  of α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases involved in DNA and histone demethylation,
  regulation of HIF, and homologous recombination. As a result, different mechanisms
  are proposed as the cause of tumorigenesis in PPGL: aberrant global hypermethylation
  (CIMP), activation of the HIF pathway and decreased DNA repair. Finally, different
  therapeutic options may target each altered pathway: demethylating agents, HIF inhibitors,
  and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, respectively. D2HG: D-2-hydroxyglutarate;
  L2HG: L-2-hydroxyglutarate; TET: ten-eleven translocation DNA hydroxylase; JMJ:
  Jumonji; KDM: histone lysine demethylase; PHDs: prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing
  proteins; HIF: hypoxia-inducible factor; CIMP: CpG island methylation phenotype.'
