caption: (A) In response to IL‐4 stimulation, glycolysis is increased; the TCA cycle
  remains intact and both fatty acid uptake and metabolism are enhanced via regulation
  of metabolic genes by STAT6 and PPARγ. (B) Alpha‐ketoglutarate, an intermediate
  of the TCA cycle, acts as a co‐substrate of lysine demethylases such as JMJD3 to
  remove the repressive H3K27me3 mark, eventually activating gene transcription. (C)
  Glutamine and glucose are employed via the Glutamine‐UDP‐GlcNac pathway to glycosylate
  proteins involved in M2 macrophage function such as CD206 and MGL. (D) Arginase
  1, upregulated by IL‐4, converts arginine to ornithine which is used in polyamine
  biosynthesis. Ornithine can be also further metabolized to spermidine which was
  found to be involved in the hypusination of translation factor eIF5A, which controls
  the production of key mitochondrial proteins involved in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS.
