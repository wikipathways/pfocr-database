caption: This figure shows the apoptotic signaling cascades triggered by Rut in nerve
  cells. Rut initiates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through interaction with the
  Fas receptor, culminating in Caspase-8 activation. In parallel, Rut stimulates the
  intrinsic mitochondrial pathway by upregulating the tumor suppressor protein P53,
  which subsequently enhances the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and
  Bak. The subsequent activation of Bax and Bak facilitates the release of cytochrome
  C from the mitochondria, thereby activating the Caspase cascade involving Caspase-9
  and Caspase-3. Additionally, Rut downregulates the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2
  and Bcl-XL, thereby potentiating the apoptotic response. The convergence of these
  pathways leads to Caspase-3 activation, which is pivotal in executing apoptosis
