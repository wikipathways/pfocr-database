caption: 'R-loops drive DNA damage responses. A) R-loops may cause DSBs and canonical
  ATM activation through three mechanisms: damage to the displaced ssDNA that is converted
  to a DSB by DNA replication, nucleolytic processing of the R-loop or fork stalled
  by R-loops, or collision of the replication fork with a backtracked RNA polymerase.
  B) R-loops may activate ATR in head-on collisions by stalling replication forks,
  which then accumulate RPA and signal to ATR through the canonical pathway. C) Non-canonical
  DNA damage response pathway activation could occur when polymerases stalled at R-loops
  activate ATM, or when RPA accumulates on the displaced ssDNA and activates ATR.'
