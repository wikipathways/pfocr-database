caption: Schematic diagram depicting the role of miR-27a in Mycobacterium avium subspecies
  paratuberculosis (MAP)-mediated signaling pathways in macrophage. Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is triggered by toll-like receptors (TLRs), and TLR2/4
  is more critical in signaling through various adopter proteins. A complex of protein
  integrations are involved in the downsignaling cascades consisting of TGF-β-activated
  protein kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK binding protein 1 (TAB 1), and TAB 2 or TAB 3. This
  interaction induces phosphorylation of TAK1, which results in the activation of
  the MAPK-p38 (mitogen-associated protein kinases). This leads to the activation
  and nuclear translocation of transcription factors, which play a critical role in
  the expression of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin
  (IL)-10. MAP predominantly induces an immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10, which subverts
  protective immune responses and promotes MAP growth and survival. MAP downregulates
  the expression of miR-27a, while miR27a inhibits the activation of the MAPK-p38
  signaling pathway by targeting TAB 2. Furthermore, miR-27a negatively regulates
  the expression of IL-10 by directly targeting IL-10 mRNA at its 3′-UTR.
