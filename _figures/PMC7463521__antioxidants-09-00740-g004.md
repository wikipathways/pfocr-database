caption: OS triggers chronic neuroinflammation, promoting neurodegeneration. Glial
  cells express TLR and NLR that sense harmful agents. Glial activation through TLR
  triggers the NF-κB signaling pathway and NLR like ligand-gated ionotropic purinergic
  receptor (P2X) that triggers NLRP3 signaling, promoting cytokine release, and also
  chemokines and RS (from NOX and iNOS enzymes). In healthy CNS, glial cells resolve
  the inflammatory response; in NDDs, the presence of protein aggregates and factors
  released from dying neurons leads to a sustained glial activation that contributes
  to neuronal demise.
