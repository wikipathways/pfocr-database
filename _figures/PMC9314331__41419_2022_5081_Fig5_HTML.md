caption: A Feedback regulation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. S6K could phosphorylate
  multiple sites of IRS1, leading to its degradation and insensitivity to insulin
  treatment. S6Ks also tune the activity, stability, or complex formation of PDK1
  and mTORC2, key regulators of full AKT activation. Inhibition of AKT in turn will
  fail to release mTORC1 activity, resulting in subsequent suppression of S6Ks. B
  S6K1 is able to phosphorylate URI, leading to disassociation of the URI/PP1γ complex,
  which liberates the phosphatase activity of PP1γ that functions to inactivate S6K1.
  C ERα could bind to the promoter of S6K and promote its transcription; on the other
  hand, ERα is subject to phosphorylation by S6K1, which promotes the transcriptional
  activity of ERα. Phosphorylation and activation of HDAC1 achieved by S6K1 is responsible
  for hypoacetylation of histones, which results in compact chromatin and suppression
  of transcription of ERα.
