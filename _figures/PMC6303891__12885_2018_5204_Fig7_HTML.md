caption: The putative mechanism is demonstrating how the loss of SEMA5A can trigger
  EMT. Representative schematic demonstrates the proposed mechanism of how the loss
  of SEMA5A leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which furthermore leads
  to inhibition of GSK-3β. This in turn results in the stabilization of β-catenin
  and Snail protein. Stabilization of β-catenin leads to active translocation of β-catenin
  from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, further leading to activation of WNT signaling.
  On the other hand, stabilization of Snail protein leads to the repression of transcription
  of E-cad. This suppression of E-cad transcription leads to a decrease in the E-cad
  protein levels, as well as leading to the induction of EMT
