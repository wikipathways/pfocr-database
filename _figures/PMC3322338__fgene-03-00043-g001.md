caption: Hypothetical model for neuroimmune-related actions of miRNAs in brain of
  human alcoholics (e.g., in microglia). Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from
  commensal bacteria, for example, could leak into the bloodstream due to gut leakiness
  induced by alcohol consumption. A compromised blood brain barrier due to high ethanol
  concentration in the blood will consequently allow LPS to reach the brain and trigger
  TLR signaling cascades that activate nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and induce the
  transcription of a variety of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., cytokines), as well
  as miRNA genes. Newly synthesized pro-inflammatory factors are secreted to unleash
  a systemic neuroinflammatory response and to maintain a positive feedback loop in
  same activated cell. These second round of pro-inflammatory factor production is
  achieved through the expression of alternative cytokine receptors in the activated
  cell, which signal back to the nucleus through the JAK/STAT pathway to induce production
  of additional pro-inflammatory factors (e.g., interferons) and miRNA genes. To avoid
  over-amplification of these signals and excessive inflammation due to hyper-responsiveness
  to LPS insult, specific miRNAs (e.g., members of the miR-146, miR-152, and let-7
  families) are consequently upregulated in order to suppress TLR4/CXCR4 signaling
  through inhibition of multiple cascade transducers such as IL1 receptor-associated
  kinases (IRAKs), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and TLR4/CXCR4 themselves,
  among others. As a compensatory reaction, other miRNAs (e.g., miR-203) that activate
  the alternative JAK/STAT pathway are also upregulated in an effort to maintain the
  immune-activated state of the specific cell subtype while promoting a benign, contained
  inflammatory response. Concomitantly, immune-activated cells implement miRNA-mediated
  epigenetics mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone methylation and/or acetylation)
  that ensure chromatin modification and global changes in gene expression that allow
  for long-term homeostatic changes and cellular adaptations under the particular
  environmental conditions. Expectedly, miRNAs that target epigenetic factors are
  also activated in order to control and/or fine-tune the ongoing remodeling of the
  cellular epigenome.
