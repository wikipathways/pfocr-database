caption: Protein-protein interaction network in STRING of proteins encoded by differentially
  expressed genes. Only connected (N = 116 genes) genes that were identified to be
  differentially expressed between mechanically stressed and control cartilage of
  osteochondral explants are shown. Two clusters with high interactions were identified
  upon studying connections within STRING. One cluster corresponds with genes found
  in the cellular senescence pathway (dotted circle), while the other cluster consists
  of proteins that are involved in IGF-1 signaling (black circle)
