caption: Overview of the putative Piper phenylpropanoid pathway and expression profiles
  of genes involved in this pathway []. The red box includes the critical enzymes
  that compose the entry pathway. The yellow route toward the production of monolignols
  is potential existence in this pathway. Enzymes shown in red or green indicate gene
  induction or suppression, respectively. Enzymes shown in black are those with both
  increased and decreased transcripts
