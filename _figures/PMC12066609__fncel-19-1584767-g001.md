caption: Astrocytic autophagy at the neurovascular interface. The neurovascular unit
  (NVU) consists of neurons, astrocytes, capillaries lined by endothelial cells, and
  the perivascular space in between. Neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate), ions, metabolites
  (e.g., lactate) and cytokines (e.g., IL-18 and IL-1β) released into the perivascular
  space by either neurons or astrocytes influence processes in both cell types in
  a bidirectional manner, including the regulation of autophagy. In astrocytes, autophagy
  regulates the availability of recycled proteins, influencing the expression of ion
  channels and transporters (e.g., SNAT, EEAT, MCT, GLUT1) in the plasma membrane.
  This affects the uptake of key transmitters and metabolites such as glutamate and
  glucose, as well as the release of glutamine and lactate from astrocytes (pathway
  1). Mitophagy, a specific form of autophagy, affects mitochondrial homeostasis and
  regulates cholesterol and lipid synthesis, as well as the cytoplasmic pool of lactate
  and glutamine in astrocytes (pathway 2). Additionally, inhibition of autophagy in
  astrocytes activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, promoting the cleavage of pro-IL-18
  and pro-IL-1β into their active forms via caspase1 activation (pathway 3). IL-18
  and IL-1β are predominantly released into the extracellular space by exocytosis,
  modulating inflammation through autocrine and paracrine signaling. Systemically
  administered autophagy modulators (e.g., rapamycin, simvastatin, everolimus, temsirolimus,
  BCN4, NMN, berberine, astragalin, resveratrol) permeate through the endothelial
  cells into the perivascular space and act on neurons and astrocytes. By modulating
  autophagy in both cell types, these compounds can influence intercellular signaling
  and neuronal function. GLUT1, Glucose transporter type 1; SNAT, Sodium-coupled neutral
  amino acid transporter; EEAT, Excitatory amino acid transporter; MCT, Monocarboxylate
  transporter; BCN4, Beclin 1-derived peptide; NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide
