caption: Regulation of HIFα stabilization in normoxia and hypoxia conditions as well
  in an oxygen independent pathway. In normoxia, HIFα is hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase
  domain (PHD) protein. The proline-hydroxylated HIFα is then recognized by von Hippel-Lindau
  E3 ubiquitin ligase (VHL) and subjected to be degraded via proteasome. In hypoxia,
  HIFα becomes stable and dimeries with HIF-1β. After translocation to the nucleus,
  the HIF heterodimer binds the hypoxia response element (HRE) of target genes to
  regulate transcription. Besides, NF-κb and STAT3 signaling activation induce Hifa
  mRNA transcription under normoxia or hypoxia.
