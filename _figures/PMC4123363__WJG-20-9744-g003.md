caption: 'Schematic representation of the p38α as a mediator of resistance in colorectal
  cancer. A: p38α is a mediator of resistance to irinotecan, 5-FU and cisplatin and
  its activation correlates with impaired response to therapy in colorectal cancer
  (CRC) patients; B: p38α pharmacological inhibition combined with chemotherapeutic
  agents decreases viability of cancer cells and strongly increases Bax-dependent
  apoptotic cell death by activating the tumor suppressor protein FoxO3A. FoxO3A activation
  up-regulates transcription of its target genes (p21, PTEN, Bim and GADD45), which
  forces both chemosensitive and chemoresistant CRC cells to undergo apoptosis.'
