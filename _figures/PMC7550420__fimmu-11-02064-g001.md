caption: Diagram of STING-mediated immune response to viruses. The cytosolic dsDNA
  derived from DNA viruses, bacteria CDNs and mitochondria are sensed by cGAS, which
  catalyzes ATP and GTP to generate cGAMP. Cyclic GAMP directly binds to the pocket
  of STING dimer and initiates the translocation of STING. STING translocates from
  the ER to ERGIC, Golgi apparatus and endosome, where it is degraded in the lysosome.
  The phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and palmitoylation are essential for the activation
  of STING. The activated STING dimer recruits TBK1 to form the translocation complex.
  By recruiting and phosphorylating IRF3, the complex promoted IRF3 to entry into
  nucleus. STING induces the expression of type I IFN genes and other pro-inflammatory
  cytokines through the TBK1–IRF3 axis and NF-κB signal pathway.
