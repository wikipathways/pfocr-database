caption: 'Schematic drawings of GABAB receptor (GABABR)–mediated synthesis of IP3
  and intracellular Ca2+signaling under (A) basal or (B) Gq-coupled receptor activation
  in human airway smooth muscle. (A) The Gβγ subunit, dissociated from the GABAB receptor,
  activates PLC-β, which hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into
  1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3. IP3 binds to IP3 receptors (IP3R) located on the
  sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The activation of IP3 receptors results in an efflux
  of Ca2+ into the cytosol, which induces airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction.
  (B) Activation of the GABAB receptor potentiates the Gq-coupled receptor–mediated
  synthesis of IP3 and intracellular Ca2+signaling. Hypothetically, two mechanisms
  are involved: (1) the Gβγ subunit, dissociated from the GABAB receptor, directly
  activates PLC-β; and (2) the GABAB receptor provides the Gβγ subunit directly to
  the Gq-coupled receptor, which facilitates activation of the Gqsignaling pathway.'
