caption: 'Carbon-source preferences and use in cancer metabolism. Glucose carbons
  are oxidized to produce pyruvate trough glycolysis. Glucose carbons fuel the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and subsequent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria.
  Intermediates of glucose metabolism are diverted from glycolysis and used for biosynthetic
  purposes such as the pentose phosphate pathway, the serine pathway, and the one
  carbon metabolism–Folate–Methionine cycle and the transulfuration pathway. The TCA
  cycle can be fueled through anaplerotic reactions involving glutamine, alanine,
  aspartate, serine, palmitate (or other fatty acids, not represented) and lactate.
  Carbon sources are highlighted in bold, anti-oxidant in blue and enzymes in italic.
