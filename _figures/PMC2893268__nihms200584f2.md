caption: Interplays between various posttranslational modifications. Schematic models
  for the interplays between different modifications. (A) Phosphorylation enhances
  the acetylation of RelA. Stimulus-coupled phosphorylation of S276 or S536 leads
  to more effective recruitment of p300 and displacement of HDACs (1), which in turn
  mediates the acetylation of K310 (2). Phosphorylated and acetylated forms of RelA
  can transcribe NF-κB-dependent genes (3). (B) Acetylation of K310 inhibits RelA
  methylation at K314 and K315. p300-mediated acetylation of K310 inhibits the binding
  of Set9 to RelA, thereby impairing the Set9-mediated methylation of K314 and K315
  (1). Deacetylation of RelA by SIRT1 (2) facilitates the recruitment of Set9 to RelA
  and consequently leads to the methylation of K314 and K315 (3) and the termination
  of NF-κB activation (4). (C) Phosphorylation of S468 stimulates the ubiquitination
  of RelA. IKKs-mediated phosphorylation of S468 (1) facilitates the binding of the
  COMMD1-containing ECS E3 ligase complex for the ubiquitination (2) and subsequent
  degradation and termination of NF-κB (3). (D) Methylation of RelA triggers the ubiquitination
  and degradation of NF-κB. Set9-mediated methylation of K314 and K315 (1) might create
  a docking site for the recruitment of an unknown E3 ligase for the ubiquitination
  (2) and subsequent degradation and termination of NF-κB (3).
