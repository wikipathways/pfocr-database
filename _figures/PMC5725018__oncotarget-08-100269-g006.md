caption: Normal expression of Gsdma3 results in a proper hair follicle differentiation.
  In Gsdma3-mutant mice, loss of function of Gsdma3 leads to decreased Wnt5a expression
  in epithelia of the hair follicle. Decreased Wnt5a in epithelia causes up-regulated
  canonical Wnt signaling pathway, leading to a disrupted homeostasis of the DP, which
  results in an aberrant epithelial differentiation. Whereas overexpression of Wnt5a
  results in decreased expression of canonical Wnt signaling pathway genes, which
  also leads to a disrupted homeostasis of the DP, in turn causing an aberrant epithelial
  differentiation. Colorful depicts represent the heterogeneity in TACs. BM, basement
