caption: A model of the biosynthesis, regulation, and deposition of apple cuticular
  wax based on progress made in apple and other plants. (A) Apple cuticular wax biosynthetic
  pathway. Blue and green represent the same and different synthetic pathways as in
  Arabidopsis. TP, transport protein. (B) Environmental and genetic co-regulatory
  networks of cuticular wax biosynthesis at different regulatory levels. Blue represents
  the structural genes related to cuticular wax synthesis; green represents the transcriptional
  factors related to cuticular wax synthesis; red represents E3 ubiquitin ligase;
  orange represents the histone acetylation genes (HDA15 and GCN5). (C) Simple deposition
  diagram of the apple fruit cuticle. Different colors represent different apple cuticular
  wax components and positions. The graphics are not drawn according to the true ratio.
