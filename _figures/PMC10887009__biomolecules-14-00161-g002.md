caption: 'Met plays a pivotal role in the survival and functional repertoire of Hp.
  Hp infection destroys the mucus layer of the stomach, leading to chronic inflammation
  within the stomach. During this period, Hp is damaged by both the acidic environment
  within the stomach and oxidizing factors secreted by inflammatory cells. Hp is able
  to resist the acidic environment through urease. And it utilizes Met to counteract
  the antioxidant factors. The S (Met-S) of the Met residue of urease and catalase
  reacts with oxidizing factors to convert high oxidizing factors to gastric low oxidizing
  factors, converts itself to Met-SO, and then converts back to Met-S when catalyzed
  by methionine sulfoxide reductase. Hcy is converted to H2S via three pathways: cystathionine
  β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfotransferase
  (3MST). H2S is a reducing agent that scavenges oxidizing molecules, including ROS
  and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Additionally, H2S enhances wound healing by facilitating
  angiogenesis through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway.
  Furthermore, H2S restricts neutrophil migration, inflammation, and oxidative burst'
