caption: 'Proposed mechanisms linking YAP/TAZ activity to mechanical cues from the
  ECM. (a) Activation of YAP/TAZ in response to high mechanical tension. Increased
  extracellular tension leads to the interaction between integrins and FAs, triggering
  Rho GTPase activation, G-actin polymerization, and the formation of F-actin. This
  complex stretches the LINC complex, leading to the inactivation of LATS1/2 and facilitating
  the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ for gene expression. (b) Inactivation of YAP/TAZ
  under low mechanical tension conditions. When cells experience low extracellular
  tension, the connection between integrins and FAs becomes unstable, causing F-actin
  depolymerization into G-actin. This process triggers the activation of the Hippo
  pathway, resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ and subsequent degradation
  induced by 14-3-3. YAP: Yes-associated protein; TAZ: transcriptional coactivator
  with PDZ-binding motif; ECM: extracellular matrix; FAs: focal adhesions; Rho: Ras
  homology; GTPase: guanosine triphosphatase; G-actin: globular actin; F-actin: filamentous
  actin; LINC: linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton; LATS: large tumor suppressor
  kinase; TEAD: transcriptional enhanced associate domain; MOB1: Mps one binder kinase
  activator-like 1; MST1/2: macrophage stimulating 1/2; SAV: Salvador family WW‑domain‑containing
  protein; P: phosphorylated.'
