caption: EBV miRNAs Control Cell ApoptosisDeath receptors Fas, tumor necrosis factor-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (TRAIL-R), and tumor necrosis factor receptors
  (TNF-R) form death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) upon interacting with their
  ligands, consequently inducing the caspase cascade. Caspase-8 activation causes
  the cleavage of BID to tBID, which initiates the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway. EBV miRNAs regulate intrinsic apoptosis mainly through their
  gene-regulatory function. EBV miRNAs can repress the expression of pro-apoptotic
  proteins (BAD, BIM, TOMM22, BID, PUMA, and CASP3). One viral miRNA, miR-BART15-3p,
  is found to inhibit the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (BRUCE and TAX1BP1).
