caption: 'Schematic diagram of the complement system. The complement system can be
  activated via the classical pathway (CP), the lectin pathway (LP), or the alternative
  pathway (AP). These three pathways have their own pattern in forming C3 convertase:
  C4b2a or C3bBb. The C3a binds its anaphylatoxin receptor the C3aR, while C3b can
  induce phagocytosis of opsonized targets and its further degradation products, iC3b,
  C3c and C3d/C3dg are able to bind various complement receptors. C3b can also bind
  to the former C3 convertase, which then results in formation of the C5 convertases:
  C4bC2aC3b or C3bBbC3b. The C5 convertases cleaves C5 into the C5a and C5b. The C5a
  binds its anaphylatoxin receptor the C5aR1 and C5aR2, whereas C5b, C6, C7, C8 and
  up to 16 molecules of C9 bind together to form the MAC, which forms a channel on
  the surface of targeted cells and causes cells to swell and lysis. In addition to
  the rate-limiting effect of the C3 and C5 convertase, there are also soluble regulatory
  proteins (i.e., C1INH, C4BP, and FH) and membrane regulatory proteins (i.e., CR1,
  CD46, and CD55) that regulate the activation of complement cascades. The anaphylatoxins
  C3a and C5a mediate inflammatory mudulation through binding to their receptors,
  respectively. MBL, mannose binding lectin; MASP, MBL associated serine protease;
  FD, factor D; FB, factor B; FH, factor H; C1INH, C1 inhibitor; FI, factor I; C4BP,
  C4b-binding protein; CR, complement receptor; MAC, membrane attack complex, SP,
  S protein.'
