caption: Proposed mechanism for the introduction of phosphate into glycogen by glycogen
  synthase. Glycogen synthase normally transfers a glucose residue from UDP-glucose
  to form a new α-1,4-glycosidic linkage with the C4-hydroxyl at the reducing end
  of a glycogen chain (pathway c). The proposed phosphorylation mechanism would involve
  the formation, in the active site of glycogen synthase, of either glucose-1,2-cyclic
  phosphate (pathway a) or glucose-1,3-cyclic phosphate (pathway b). Reaction of the
  C1 of the cyclic phosphodiester would result in the transfer of either a glucose-2-phosphate
  or a glucose-3-phosphate moiety in α-1,4-glycosidic linkage to a reducing end of
  glycogen.
