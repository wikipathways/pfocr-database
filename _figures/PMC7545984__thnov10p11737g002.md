caption: Pro-fibrotic roles of the GSK-3β signaling network in fibrosis. The AKT signaling
  phosphorylates GSK-3β at Ser9, which leads to its inactivation. Arrb2 knockout attenuates
  fibrosis through decreasing (by increased phosphorylation) GSK-3β activity. GSK-3β
  phosphorylates MAPK kinases, including p38, ERK, and JNK, which are implicated in
  fibrogenesis. Inhibition of the GSK-3β signaling pathway enhances the Nrf2 level
  in the nucleus. GSK-3β regulates the nuclear translocation of NF-κB to promote or
  inhibit its activity. Moreover, GSK-3β inhibition increases the phosphorylation
  of CREB at Ser133. ROS, reactive oxygen species; Akt, protein kinase B; Arrb2, β-arrestin
