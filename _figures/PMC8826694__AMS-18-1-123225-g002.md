caption: 'The most important effects of statins on lung cancer: inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, stopping the mevalonate production from HMG-CoA
  and reducing mevalonate level, inhibiting myocardial Rac1-GTPase activity in order
  to suppress the NADPH oxidase activity and ROS generation. Also statins are inhibitors
  of farnesyltransferase (FT) proteins, RAF/ERK and AKT pathways, inhibitors of the
  EGFR and anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 in animals and humans. Additionally, they
  have effects on cellular energy homeostasis by inducing LKB1 and AMPK activation,
  and by inducing p53 pathway and G1 cell cycle arrest, which prevents DNA damage'
