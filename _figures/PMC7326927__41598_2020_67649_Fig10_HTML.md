caption: Summary of the effects of MPP+ and rotenone exposure on IL4-induced immune
  response on primary glial cell cultures. Immunometabolism refers to the close relationship
  existing between immune response and cell metabolism and the hypothesis that metabolic
  reprogramming is behind the development of a proper immune response by glial cells.
  IL4 treatment induces the expression of anti-inflammatory markers and CD200R1, and
  the stimulation of the CD200R1 immune receptor in microglial cells may play a role
  in the former by a still underexplored mechanism (right side of the figure, green
  and orange arrows). MPP+ and rotenone are inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain and consequently impair oxidative phosphorylation, which is associated to
  changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the control of
  glial cell metabolism in both microglial (µG) and mixed glial (MG) cultures (left
  side of the figure, red arrows). The inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation by
  the neurotoxicants stimulates aerobic glycolysis (associated to lactate production)
  and the pentose phosphate pathway in mixed glial cultures, while fatty acid oxidation
  and not the pentose phosphate pathway is stimulated in microglial cell cultures.
  This impairment may be responsible for the inhibition of the expression of anti-inflammatory
  markers observed in mixed glial cultures and, to a lesser extent, in microglial
  cultures after MPP+ and rotenone treatment. CARKL sedoheptulokinase; GLUT1 glucose
  transporter 1; HIF1α hypoxia-inducible factor 1, alpha subunit; PFKP phosphofructokinase,
