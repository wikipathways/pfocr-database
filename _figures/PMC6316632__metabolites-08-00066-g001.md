caption: An overview of the simple central carbon network of the Xanthomonas oryzae
  pv. oryzae BXO43 strain. A KEGG mapper was used for mapping the presence and absence
  of any annotated enzyme throughout the metabolic pathways among the Xoo strains
  (see legend for color codes). The enzyme responsible at each node is represented
  by enzyme commission (EC) numbers. The absence of any enzyme in a strain is shown
  by the absence of any color. The central metabolic pathway intermediates that are
  responsible for various amino acids biosynthetic routes are presented. The intermediates
  of four major metabolic pathways, namely, Glycolysis, the Tricarboxylic acid cycle,
  Entner-Doudoroff and pentose phosphate pathway (simplified) are shown in green,
  red, violet and orange, respectively, whereas amino acids are depicted using their
  three-letter code in black.
