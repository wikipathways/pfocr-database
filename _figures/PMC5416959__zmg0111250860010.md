caption: A putative model for how 9-cis-RA-activated RXRα may affect the steady-state
  RFC-PCNA complex to inhibit cell proliferation. In the absence of ligand (normal
  state), a multiprotein complex (five RFC subunits) binds and opens a ring-shaped
  sliding-clamp PCNA in the first stage of processive DNA synthesis for cell-cycle
  control, DNA replication and repair, and the apoptotic pathway (, ). RXRα appears
  to contact these complexes through RFC4 and partially RFC3, whose exact composition
  is still unknown. Upon ligand binding (9-cis-RA-activated state), RXRα may interact
  with RFC3, and this interaction appears to cause dissociation of the core RFC subunits
  (RFC2/4/5) () and PCNA to inhibit cell proliferation. Knockdown of RXRα or overexpression
  of RFC3 may drive backward partially to the normal state even in the presence of
  9-cis-RA.
