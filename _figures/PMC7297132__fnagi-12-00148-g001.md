caption: Characteristics of astrocyte senescence. Senescent astrocytes that have undergone
  cell cycle arrest and have enlarged sharply. The expression of GFAP increased, whereas
  the expression of glutamate transporters (GLAST and GS) and SR-B1 and LRP1 decreased.
  The lysosomal content has increased, and the lysosomes have high β-galactosidase
  activity and dysfunctional mitochondria that produce high levels of ROS and release
  mtDNA. They have DNA damage and SAHFs, and their nuclear integrity is compromised
  due to the loss of laminB1. The elevated ROS activates the NF-κB pathway and promotes
  SASP production. The secretion of neurotrophic factors is decreased. GFAP, glial
  fibrillary acidic protein; GLAST, glutamate aspartate transporter; GLT-1, glutamate
  transporter-1; GS, glutamine synthetase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase;
  LRP1, lipoprotein receptor–related protein 1; NOX, NADPH oxidase; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; SAHFs, senescence-associated heterochromatic foci; SASP, senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype; SR-B1, scavenger receptor B1.
