caption: 'Activation of TLR leads to signaling via two principal pathways: MyD88-dependent
  pathway and TRIF-dependent pathway. TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9 () signal via MyD88-dependent
  pathway where myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and MyD88
  adaptor-like protein (Mal) recruitment leads to activation of IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinases (IRAKs) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6).
  Phosphorylation of the inhibitory unit of the transcription factor NF-κB complex,
  κKα/β, leads to nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB and production of
  proinflammatory cytokines. TLR4 signals also via TRIF-dependent pathway. TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) recruitment
  leads to activation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)
  and production of interferons. TRIF interacts also with receptor interacting protein
  1 (RIP1) and TRAF6 leading to activation of NF-κB as in MyD88-dependent pathway.'
