caption: 'Schematic representation of the MK pathway and various consequences of mevalonate
  kinase gene (MVK) pathogenic variants for the different MK-associated disease subtypes.
  Pathogenic variants impede the folding and stability of MK and therefore its enzymatic
  activity, which results in mevalonic acid accumulation, decreased production of
  geranyl-geranyl-pyrophosphate, and ultimately activation of the pyrin inflammasome.
  Dashed arrows represent multiple steps in the pathway; green and red arrows and
  words depict normal MK (protein) pathway and pathogenic consequences of MVK (gene)
  mutations, respectively. PP: pyrophosphate; MVD: mevalonate diphosphodecarboxylase;
  PMVK: phosphomevalonate kinase; FDPS: farnesyl diphosphate synthase; IL-1: interleukin
  1.'
