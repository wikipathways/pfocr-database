caption: Cell stress pathway evoked by laser phototoxicity involves specific molecules
  within the endoplasmic reticulum. At sub-phototoxic doses, damaged protein are either
  refolded or targeted for destruction by autophagy mediated by ATF4. Exceeding the
  laser phototoxic dose threshold results in decreased ATF4 expression and commits
  the cell to excessive autophagy and apoptosis.
