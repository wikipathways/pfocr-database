caption: Additional gut microbial metabolites regulate host immunity and metabolism.
  Microbiome-derived succinate can facilitate IGN and upgrade type 2 immunity against
  parasitic infection. Lactate participates in intestinal wound repair by triggering
  ISCs in a GPR81-dependent manner. DAT confers resistance against virus infection
  by amplifying IFN-I signaling. A mixture of 11 rare, commensal-derived bacteria
  facilitates the development and accumulation of IFNγ+CD8+ T cells to enhance anti-tumor
  immunity and anti-intracellular pathogen infection. UroA can modulate junction proteins,
  which directly regulate epithelial permeability. Imidazole propionate obstructs
  the insulin receptor signaling pathway and results in the onset of insulin resistance
  following the inhibition of IRS function
