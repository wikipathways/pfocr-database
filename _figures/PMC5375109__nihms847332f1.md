caption: Pressure overload upregulates the expression of miR-33a in the heart. Deficiency
  of miR-33a in cardiac fibroblasts increases the expression of target gene ABCA1,
  which mediates cholesterol efflux to apoAI. Increased cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts
  results in decreased intracellular cholesterol and lipid raft content, which are
  associated to activation of AKT signaling pathway and cell cycle progression. Impaired
  fibroblast proliferation leads to insufficient reactive fibrosis and adaptive remodeling
  and causes cardiac dysfunction and heart failure.
