caption: 'Proposed model of cross-regulation between LAP and canonical autophagy in
  p47phox−/− mice. The figure shows that both autophagy and LAP are defective in p47phox−/−
  mice. Rapamycin, a known inducer of canonical autophagy, failed to promote fungal
  clearance and reduce inflammation when administered to CGD mice as opposed to IFN-γ
  that promoted fungal clearance and reduced pathogenic inflammation by inducing the
  LAP/DAPK1 pathway. Thus, canonical autophagy and LAP are distinct pathways in Aspergillus
  infection, and LAP, more than canonical autophagy, is required for optimal antifungal
  resistance. CGD: chronic granulomatous disease; DAPK1: death-associated protein
  kinase 1; IFN-γ: interferon gamma; LAP: LC3-associated phagocytosis; WT: wild type.'
