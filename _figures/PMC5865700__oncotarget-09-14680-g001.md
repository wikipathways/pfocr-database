caption: (A) In the absence of Shh binding to Ptch, Ptch exerts an inhibitory action
  on Smo. Gli is associated with SUFU in the cytoplasm and is inactive. (B) When Shh
  binds to Ptch, Smo is activated and induces the migration of Gli into the nucleus
  with subsequent activation of the transcription of target genes. Main inhibitors
  of the Shh pathway are also shown.
