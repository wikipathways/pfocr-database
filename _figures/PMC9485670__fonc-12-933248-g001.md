caption: Abnormal energy metabolism and resistance to imatinib. (A) OXPHOS protein
  expression is increased in IM-resistant GIST cells, and IM specifically increases
  the expression of complex II (SDHB) protein by downregulating miR-483-3p. (B) GLUT-1
  and glycolytic pathway components increase in IM-resistant GIST cells. (C) The HIF-1α–PGD–PPP
  axis and IM-induced ROS stimulate GIST cells from the G1 phase to the S phase, leading
  to drug resistance.
