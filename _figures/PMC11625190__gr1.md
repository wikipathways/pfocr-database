caption: Biosynthetic pathway of 1-phenylethylisoquinoline-derived PIAs. (A) Native
  biosynthetic route of PIA products. The shikimate pathway products phenylalanine
  and tyrosine are proposed to be processed to 4-hydroxydihydrocinnamaldehyde (4-HDCA,
  4) and dopamine (3), respectively, which are then joined through a Pictet–Spengler
  reaction to form the 1-phenethylisoquinoline (1) scaffold. Solid arrows indicate
  identified steps, and the dashed arrows show unknown modification reactions. (B)
  Heterologous pathway of 1 in tobacco for the production of colcine precursors. (C)
  Heterologous production of 1 in microbes from multicarbon precursor. ʟ-DOPA (2),
  levodopa; 4-HPP, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanol; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase;
  DBR, NADPH-dependent double-bond reductase; AER, NADPH-dependent 2-alkenal reductase;
  TYR, tyrosinase; TyrH, tyrosine hydroxylase; DODC, tyrosine/DOPA decarboxylase;
