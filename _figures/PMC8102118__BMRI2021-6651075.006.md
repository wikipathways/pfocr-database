caption: The possible mechanism of crosstalk between CDA1 and TGF-β promoting renal
  fibrosis in DN. The canonical TGF-β signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway
  marked as red arrow have been demonstrated to be associated with CDA1 expression
  in diabetic nephropathy, while pathways marked as black related with CDA1 expression
  remain unknow.
