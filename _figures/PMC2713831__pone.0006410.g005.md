caption: (a) One subcluster identified by our method consists of proteins presumably
  involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway. (b) Detailed interpretation of the relationships
  between each protein from the subcluster. On the basis of the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis 5.0, the 35 blue-green proteins on the circle participate in the TGF-β
  signaling pathway, and the 10 red proteins inside the circle are unrelated. The
  violet proteins outside the circle are common neighbors that do not belong to the
  subcluster in panel a. Red lines represent significant protein pairs, green lines
  represent direct protein–protein interactions, and yellow lines represent both.
