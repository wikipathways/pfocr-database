caption: Candidates for retrograde signaling pathways acting during PGE-limited conditions
  during shoto-morphogenesis. In PGE-limited conditions, distinct plastid metabolites
  might accumulate and activate the corresponding signaling pathway, as (1) 3′-phosphoadenosine
  5′-phosphate (PAP); (2) β-cycloidal (β-cyc), that is the product of the cleavage
  of β-carotene by singlet oxygen and results in the oxidative signaling, (3) the
  2-C-methyl-D-erythosphate (MEcPP) that is required for regulation of auxin-related
  genes, and (4) malate. It has been proposed that plNAD-MDH reduces NADH excess levels
  in plastids by converting oxaloacetate (OAA) into malate that is then exported to
  the cytoplasm to be imported into the mitochondria. In mitochondria, malate is converted
  back to OAA by mMDH, leading to the production of NADH. NADH can provide electrons
  to the electron transport chain and, if in excess, can ultimately lead to the production
  of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can further act as a signaling
  molecule to modulate nuclear gene expression and, at last, to define the structure
  of the seedling.
