caption: Pharmacological targets of antibodies in the mechanisms of NMO pathogenesis.
  The entry of AQP4-IgG produced by plasma cells into the CNS through the BBB plays
  an important role in the pathogenesis of NMO. Tocilizumab and satralizumab specifically
  bind to interleukin (IL)-6 receptors and block the IL-6 signaling pathway and reduce
  plasma cells derived from B cells. Inebilizumab specifically binds to CD19 and rituximab
  specifically binds to CD20, deleting B cells that inhibit the B/T-cell interaction,
  decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, increasing regulatory T cells, and modulating
  the T-cell compartment. Aquaporumab specifically binds to astrocyte AQP4 to block
  the binding of AQP4-IgG and AQP4, thus decreasing CDC and ADCC; C1qmAb specifically
  binds to complement C1q to block the classical complement pathway. Eculizumab specifically
  binds to complement C5 and blocks all terminal pathways of complement activation
  (classical, lectin, and alternative) and prevents the formation of MAC. Bevacizumab
  specifically binds to VEGF-A, which is beneficial for the BBB and decreases the
  entry of AQP4–IgG and inflammatory cells into the CNS, especially in acute NMO exacerbations.
  mAbs specifically block the pathological processes of NMO, thereby reducing astrocyte
  lysis, oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, and neuron loss. IL-6, interleukin-6;
  IL-6R, IL-6 receptor; VEGF-A, vascular endothelial growth factor A; VEGFR2, VEGF
  receptor 2; AQP4, aquaporin-4; CDC, complement-dependent cytotoxicity; MAC, membrane
  attack complex; NMO, neuromyelitis optica; BBB, blood brain barrier; CNS, central
  nervous system.
