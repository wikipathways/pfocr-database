caption: Both glucose and glutamine contribute to the synthesis of two most abundant
  amino acids (glycine and proline) in collagen protein. Glycine can be synthesized
  from the glycolytic intermediate, 3-phosphoglycerate (3P glycerate) by the enzymes
  of serine glycine synthesis pathway including phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH),
  phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), and
  serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2). Glutamine is converted to glutamate by
  glutaminase (GLS) in glutaminolysis. Glutamate is not only a precursor for proline
  but also contributes to the generation of glycine by donating nitrogen through the
  PSAT1 transamination reaction.
