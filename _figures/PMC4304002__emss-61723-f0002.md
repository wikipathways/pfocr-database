caption: Canonical WNT signalling regulates mesenchymal stem cell fate. Activation
  of WNT/β-catenin signalling promotes differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells
  into myocytes and osteocytes while suppressing commitment to the adipocytic lineage
  and terminal differentiation. WNT signalling restrains adipocyte differentiation
  by inhibiting the expression of PPARG and CEBPA, the central regulators of adipogenesis.
  These transcription factors are induced directly by CEBPB and CEBPD in response
  to adipogenic stimuli, which also serve to switch off the canonical WNT pathway.
  PPARG and CEBPA subsequently feed back to induce their own expression, in addition
  to activating many downstream target genes whose expression defines the adipocyte.
