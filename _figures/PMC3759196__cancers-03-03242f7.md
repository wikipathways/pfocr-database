caption: The p53 pathway and retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein signaling
  are shown. MDM2 and MDM4 are important negative regulators of the p53. p14ARF inhibits
  MDM2, thus promoting p53. DNA damage activates ATM, which leads to activation of
  checkpoint kinases (CHK2) and p53. Solid and dashed arrows indicate activation and
  suppression, respectively. Activating genetic alterations are shown in red circle.
  Genetic alterations that lead to a loss of function are indicated in blue circle.
