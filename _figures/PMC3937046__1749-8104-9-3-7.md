caption: 'Neuronal circuit diagram of the light input pathway in the tadpole retina.
  Cells expressing c-fos in response to a first exposure to light are shown in gray,
  and we propose that they correspond to second-order or third-order neurons. Photosensitive
  cells (>>>) do not express c-fos as they are first-order neurons. Melanopsin-expressing
  retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) induce c-fos in response to light, either by serving
  as first-order neurons because of their intrinsic photosensitivity, or via a role
  as a second-order or third-order neuron that receives synaptic inputs from other
  retinal cells. The classic IF circuit is present in both the central and peripheral
  retina. In lower vertebrates, rods (R) and cones (C) in the ONL are connected via
  gap junctions (black ovals) and synapse directly on a single class of On-BCs (Otx2+
  / Isl1+), which drive activity in a sub-population of ACs (Pax6− / Isl1−) []. Finally,
  the pathway drives c-fos expression in two equally abundant RGC sub-populations
  (Pax6− / Isl1+ and Pax6+ / Isl1+). Not illustrated are the cells of the retinal
  IF circuit that do not express c-fos in response to light: the HCs, Off-BCs, and
  Pax6+ and/or Isl1+ ACs. The cells involved in non-image-forming (NIF) tasks express
  melanopsin and are preferentially distributed in the peripheral retina. These include
  the mHCs (Prox1+),mRGCs (Pax6+ / Isl1−), and dopaminergic (TH+) ACs that turn on
  c-fos with blue light. Three possible connections may induce c-fos expression in
  the TH + ACs: 1) PR-initiated inputs from On-BCs to mRGCs and/or TH + ACs; 2) synaptic
  interaction between an mRGC axon collateral with INL cells [] to provide a retrograde
  signal from mRGCs to TH + ACs []; and 3) a circuit that may only exist in lower
  vertebrates, whereby mHCs act as first-order neurons, and interplexiform (TH+) ACs
  link mHCs to mRGCs.'
