caption: The phospholipase D2 (PLD2) signalling axis is involved in both the entry
  and egress of influenza virus, as well as the process of autophagy, which can have
  antiviral function. PLD activity facilitates viral entry, whereas PLD inhibition
  delays the kinetics of viral endocytosis, thus widening the window of time in which
  the host cell can effectively prevent virus replication by producing antiviral effector
  molecules, such as interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) and MxA.
  Similarly, viral egress appears to be impaired by PLD inhibition. The regulation
  of AKT activity by PLD2 has also been shown to activate the autophagy pathway, which
  can limit virus production. PLD-generated phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) recruits AKT
  to cellular membranes, and AKT subsequently phosphorylates beclin 1 at serine 295.
  This leads to dissociation of the beclin 1–rubicon complex, a process that promotes
  autophagy. PLD inhibitors reduce PtdOH concentrations, reduce AKT-mediated phosphorylation
  of beclin 1 and stabilize the beclin 1–rubicon complex to stall autophagy. The changes
  depicted in membrane lipid composition are based on previous work that investigated
  the contributions of PtdOH to membrane curvature,.
