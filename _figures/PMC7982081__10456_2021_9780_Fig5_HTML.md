caption: Angiocrine factors control liver function. The hepatic endothelium is not
  just a passive conduit for blood. Instead, it acts as instructive gatekeeper regulating
  the hepatic microenvironment through EC-derived angiocrine factors. Pericentral
  LSEC are a prime example of angiocrine signaling. They modulate hepatocytic function, by
  secreting angiocrine Wnt2, Wnt9b, and Rspo3 to establish the spatial division of
  labor of hepatocytes (“metabolic liver zonation”). Concurrently, angiocrine Wnt-signaling
  fuels Axin2+, Lgr5+, and glutamine synthase (GS)+ pericentral hepatocytes to maintain
  the pericentral niche during tissue homeostasis. Moreover, angiocrine Wnt-signaling
  plays a pivotal role in regulating xenobiotic functions by modulating the hepatic
  cytochrome activity such as CYP2E1. In the portal zone, hepatocytes are actively
  involved in gluconeogenesis and urea cycle with increased expression of arginase
  (Arg1). Portal vein EC and periportal LSEC have high Notch activity with upregulated
  Dll4 expression. Angiocrine DLL4 may orchestrate monocyte recruitment to establish
  a niche for KC. Likewise, the hepatic immune zonation is further maintained by LSEC
  driven CXCL9 and through MYD88 pathway. Periportal LSEC also serve as a niche for
  resident LSEC progenitors expressing CD157. Midlobular LSEC control iron homeostasis
  by secretion of the angiocrine factors BMP2 and BMP6
