caption: 'While replicating a lagging strand template, pol δ maintains a loose association
  with PCNA while inserting dNTPs very fast. (1) Upon encountering a DNA lesion (X)
  it cannot accommodate, such as UV-induced CPD, pol δ rapidly dissociates from DNA,
  leaving PCNA behind. Pol δ may re-bind to the resident PCNA but pol δ-mediated DNA
  synthesis cannot resume until the lesion is replicated by one or more TLS pols.
  (2) The binding affinity of pol η for P/T DNA drives the passive exchange of pols
  at a blocked P/T junction. (3) Once localized to the blocked P/T junction, the resident
  PCNA stabilizes pol η on the DNA, increasing the efficiency of the ensuing TLS.
  (4) After replicating the CPD, dissociation of pol η is promoted downstream of the
  damage. This provides an efficient and generic pathway for pol η to depart a damaged
  template and, hence, limits the extent of error-prone DNA synthesis by pol η downstream
  of a CPD. In the event that pol η-mediated TLS across and beyond a CPD lesion terminates
  with a mismatched P/T junction, another TLS pol, such as pol ζ, may access the P/T
  junction upon pol η’s departure and faithfully extend the mismatch, allowing DNA
  synthesis by pol δ to resume.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19788.017'
