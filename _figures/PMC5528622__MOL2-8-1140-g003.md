caption: Mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies in melanoma. The remarkable
  clinical efficacy of BRAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF melanoma is limited by acquired
  and intrinsic drug resistance, with several mechanisms having been described. Upstream
  the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, activation or upregulation of RTKs such as IGF‐1R,
  PDGFRα and EGFR signalling through SFKs (SRC family kinases). Downstream the RTKs,
  on the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK axis, mutations in RAS, amplification of CRAF and BRAF, expression
  of truncated BRAF, mutations in MEK or increased expression of MAP3K8/COT or MLK1‐4.
  Downstream the RTKs, on alternative signalling pathways, deletions in PTEN and mutations
  in PI3K and AKT. * indicates mutations or activation/upregulation.
