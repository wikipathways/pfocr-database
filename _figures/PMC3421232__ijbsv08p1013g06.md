caption: Network of 25 target genes and their interactive genes involved in regulating
  apoptosis and autophagy. The target genes (cycles) are coloured with red, the genes
  (round rectangles ) interacting with target genes are coloured with green, the survival/death
  genes (diamond) are coloured with blue, the another pathways (hexagon) are coloured
  with purple, and the target compounds are coloured with gray. The solid line with
  delta tip represents direct activation, the solid line with “T” tip represents direct
  inhibition, the dash line with delta tip represents indirect activation, the dash
  line with “T” tip represents indirect inhibition, the cross-shape line represent
  dissociation, and “+p”, “-p” represent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively.
  The interactions between target genes and other genes are involved in apoptosis
  extrinsic (including fas,IL-1,IL-3 pathway) and intrinsic (mitochondria-associated
  pathway) pathways, and autophagy induction and vesicle nucleation processes.
