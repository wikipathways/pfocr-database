caption: Model of COX-1-mediated PGE2 production in response to HP-PRRSV infection.
  HP-PRRSV engages an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, which leads to the activation of ERK1/2
  and, subsequently, the phosphorylation and activation of C/EBP-β. The other signals
  resulting from PKC in combination with ERK-MAPK might also be involved in the induction
  of COX-1 by HP-PRRSV. p-C/EBP-β is critical for the transactivation of COX-1, a
  key enzyme for the synthesis of PGE2. The disruption of ERK1/2 diminished the enhanced
  COX-1 induced by HP-PRRSV.
