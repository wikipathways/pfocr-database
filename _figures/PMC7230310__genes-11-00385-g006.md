caption: A proposed model of the molecular mechanism of chicken IRF7 modulation in
  the host response to avian influenza virus (AIV) infection A schematic model of
  the early antiviral response in chickens regarding IRF7 is proposed based on the
  DEGs in this study. AIV infection is sensed by pattern recognition receptors. TLR3
  and TLR7 recognize endosomal/phagosomal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and single-stranded
  RNA (ssRNA) respectively. MDA5 and PKR respond to cytosolic dsRNA. This leads to
  a subsequent signaling cascade via adaptor molecules and protein kinases that activate
  the key transcription factors AP1, NF-κB and IRF7. The MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways
  are potentially involved in the activation process. Activated IRF7 translocates
  to the nucleus and activates the transcription of IFNβ. AP1 and NF-κB also translocate
  to the nucleus and induce type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines. Type I IFNs activate
  ISGs via the Jak–STAT pathway in an autocrine/paracrine manner through their receptors
  (IFNAR). IFIT5, interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 5; JAK1/2,
