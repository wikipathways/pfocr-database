caption: Drosophila immunity response pathways. A robust innate immunity system confers
  Drosophila protection against a variety of pathogens. Autophagy has been suggested
  to play a role in restricting infections, but the exact pathway of this response
  has yet to be deciphered. In addition there have been observations of a number of
  antimicrobial peptides (e.g., Diptericin) being expressed in response to immunological
  challenge.
