caption: Biosynthetic pathway of selenoprotein translation. Transfer-RNASec is charged
  with Ser by Seryl-tRNA synthase (Ser-RS), hence the more accurate designation tRNA[Ser]Sec.
  The kinase PSTK phosphorylates Ser-tRNASec. Selenophosphate synthase (SEPHS2) provides
  selenophosphate which is used by selenocysteine synthase (SEPSECS) to convert phosphoSer-tRNASec
  into Sec-tRNASec. EEFSEC is a translation elongation factor specific for Sec-tRNASec.
  Canonical selenoproteins carry a selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in their
  mRNA in order to re-code the UGA codon as Sec codon. The dependence of UGA/Sec re-coding
  varies among canonical selenoproteins. Several non-canonical selenoprotein genes
  have been described that do not contain a SECIS element ().
