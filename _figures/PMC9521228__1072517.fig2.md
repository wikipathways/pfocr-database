caption: Multiple-hit hypothesis of complement activation. SARS-CoV-2 infection leads
  to activation of the complement cascade through all three known pathways - classical,
  lectin, and alternative. The classical pathway is activated by binding of the C1
  complex with antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) complexes. The robust formation and continued
  presence of Ag-Ab complexes may act as a driver of complement activation in the
  setting of patient with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). SARS-CoV-2
  N protein is thought to interact with the MASP2-MBL complex leading to activation
  of the lectin pathway. SARS-CoV-2 S protein interacts and activates the C3 within
  the alternative pathway., All 3 pathways converge with the production of C3 and
  C5 convertases and ultimately the cleavage and production of both C3a and C5a, which
  are anaphylatoxins, and C5b, leading to the development of the membrane attach complex
  (MAC). C3a and C5a propagate inflammation by recruiting neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages,
  which release proinflammatory cytokines, leading to damage to surrounding tissue
  and endothelium. Additionally, in the setting of complement-mediated thrombotic
  microangiopathy (CM-TMA), the MAC is thought to lead to endothelial damage by forming
  in the membrane of endothelial cells, endotheliitis, and the formation of microthrombi.,
  In our patient series, there was likely additional activation of the complement
  system in the setting of sickle cell disease (patients 1 and 2) or autoimmune hemolytic
  anemia due to free heme that is known to interact with C3 (alternative pathway),
  which lead to increased due to free heme that is known to cause C3 (alternative
  pathway) hydrolysis with production of downstream complement (C3a, C3b, C5a, C5b).
  Patient 3 was day +45 after hematopoietic cell transplant and on a calcineurin inhibitor
  for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis that is known to lead to increased complement
  activation through the alternative pathway., An additional risk factor that was
  unknown in our patients could be the presence of complement mutations leading to
  issues with homeostatic balance of complement activity. The mechanism of action
  of eculizumab is the binding of C5, thereby preventing the formation of C5a and
  the MAC preventing downstream effects. All patients in this series either showed
  evidence of or had presumed increased level of MAC with clinical response with initiation
  of eculizumab.
