caption: T lymphocyte migration, position and survival in human liver. Hepatic T cells
  consist of effector CD8 T cells and CD4 T helper cells (Th). These cells are constantly
  controlled by regulatory T cells (Treg) to maintain hepatic tolerance. Both effector
  T cells and regulatory T cells are recruited by chemokine receptor, CXCR3. Chemokine
  CXCL9, 10 and 11 are ligands for CXCR3 and these ligands are expressed on inflamed
  hepatic sinusoids. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, gut homing lymphocytes
  (mainly Th17 and CD8 cells) which express CCR9 are recruited to PSC liver via chemokine
  CCL25 which is the ligand for CCR9 receptor and is expressed on inflamed hepatic
  sinusoidal endothelium. Thus, the CXCR3-CXCL9-11 pathway is crucial for T cell recruitment
  to inflamed AIH and PBC livers and CCR9-CCL25 axis is essential of gut homing lymphocyte
  migration to PSC livers. Once T cells are recruited, their positioning around hepatic
  parenchyma cells (hepatocytes), epithelial cells (biliary epithelium) and professional
  antigen-presenting dendritic cells also depends on chemokines. Both inflamed hepatocytes
  and biliary epithelium secrete CXCL9, 10 and 11 chemokines which position CXCR3+CD8
  T cells, Th1, Th17 and Treg to localise around inflamed hepatocytes and biliary
  epithelium. Inflamed biliary epithelium secretes CCL20 and attracts CCR6 expressing
  Th17 cells. Intrahepatic dendritic cells secrete CCL22 thus CCR4 expressing Treg
  reside in close proximity to exert their suppressive function together. Hepatic
  effector T cells (CD8, Th1 and Th17) secrete IL-2, which is crucial not only for
  autocrine survival of these effector T cells but also for Treg which highly express
  IL-2 receptor, CD25. Intrahepatic IL-2 level has been reported to be minimal due
  to continuous consumption of IL-2 pool by immune cells including Treg for their
  survival
