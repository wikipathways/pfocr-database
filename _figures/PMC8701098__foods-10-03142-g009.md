caption: Synthesis pathway of pyrocalciferol and isopyrocalciferol and their respective
  photoproducts. Previtamin D (a) can undergo an irreversible ring-closure reaction
  at temperatures higher than 100 °C resulting in either a 9α, 10α confirmation (pyrocalciferol
  (b)) or a 9β, 10β confirmation (isopyrocalciferol (c)). Further UV irradiation results
  in the formation of the bicyclo [2,2,0] exene derivatives photopyrocalciferol (d)
  and photoisopyrocalciferol (e) in a reaction that can be reversed thermically.
