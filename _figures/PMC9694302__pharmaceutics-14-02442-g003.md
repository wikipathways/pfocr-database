caption: 'Targeting effector cells with bsAbs for cancer therapy. (a) Illustration
  of bsAb mechanisms of action. Binding of bsAbs to their targets initiates downstream
  signaling pathway activation that results in (A) cancer cell growth blockade, (B)
  cancer cell apoptosis induction by cytotoxic T cells, (C) cancer cell apoptosis
  induction by ADCC (Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity) followed by T-cell expansion
  (panel on the left) as well as by granzyme and perforin release from Natural Killer
  cells (panel on the right), (D) cancer cell apoptosis induction by ADC (Antibody–Drug
  Conjugated) which mediates target drug delivery (up illustration), pro-survival
  receptor blockade (middle illustration) and ADCC (bottom illustration). (b) Structure
  and mechanism of action of Blinatumomab. TME: Tumor microenvironment.'
