caption: 'Different ways of NK-cell mediated tumor killing and immune system modulation:
  (A) NK cells are capable of enhancing the antigen presentation to T cells by killing
  the immature DC while promoting the IFN-γ and TNF-α mediated maturation of DC. (B)
  NK cells can specifically recognize the cells that lack the expression of self-MHC
  class I molecules (Missing-self). (C) ADCC can kill the target cell. (D) Fas/FasL
  pathway is a very effective NK cell-mediated cell killing as the binding of FasL
  to Fas results in delivering a “death signal” to the target cell that undergoes
  apoptosis shortly. (E) Cytokine pathway can exert anti-tumor potential as Cytokines
  such as NK cells secret several cytokines such as TNF-α. (F) NK cell receptors NKG2D
  are capable of recognizing the “induced-self” ligands that are express at a very
  high rate in response to the activation of tumor-associated pathways. (G) Checkpoint
  blockade may inhibit NK cell suppression by preventing the interaction of NK cell
  inhibitory receptors with their ligands. (H) As a result of adoptive NK cells transfer,
  the mismatch between donor and recipient, inhibitory KIRs, NK cells eliminate the
  allogeneic tumor cells that lack self-MHC. (I) CAR-NK cells designed specifically
  to target overexpressed tumor antigens are also useful in eliminating the specific
  tumor cells. (J) Specifically designed bispecific molecules are also being utilized
  to specifically eliminate tumor cells as these special molecules bind to activating
  NK cell receptors on one arm and tumor antigens on the other. (K) NK cells can enhance
  or diminish macrophage and T cell activities via IFN-γ and IL-10 production.'
