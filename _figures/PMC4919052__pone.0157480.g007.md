caption: Reported is the cross-talk among the transcription factors (TF) in bovine
  liver uncovered to be either activated or inhibited by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA). Using IPA database, it revealed the potential up-stream endogenous chemicals,
  growth factors, and cytokines affecting the activation or inhibition of the TF.
  The TF network included all the transcription factors and ligand-dependent nuclear
  receptors. The network allows visualizing the interaction among TF, the overall
  estimated activation or inhibition, the up- or down-regulation, the up-stream activators
  or inhibitors, and the enriched functions (light blue shade) or pathways (yellow
  shade) with the larger number of differentially expressed genes.
