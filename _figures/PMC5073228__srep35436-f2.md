caption: The subnetwork corresponds to the region in the global metabolic gene network
  where the most significantly differentially expressed genes between the LBF and
  HBF are located. The colours red and blue with gene names denote the fold change
  (upregulation in HBF and LBF, respectively). Different coloured lines indicate different
  metabolic pathways (labelled near each pathway). This computationally-identified
  subnetwork suggests the aspartate aminotransferase (AAT1) to be a key player in
  biofilm heterogeneity. Moreover it highlights the importance of amino acid metabolic
  pathways.
