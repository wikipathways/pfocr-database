caption: 'A) Hh signaling in the early follicle cell lineage. Hh is provided for FSCs
  from terminal filament cells, cap cells, and IGS cells. Brother of ihog (Boi) regulates
  hh release by sequestration. Under rich diet, cholesterol binds and activates the
  negative regulator of boi, Hormone receptor 96 (Hr96), allowing hh release. The
  micro-RNA family mir-310 represses Hh release by targeting Hr96, and Rab23, which
  functions in Hh transport. In canonical Hh signaling extracellular hh binds to its
  receptor Patched (Ptc) and prevents Ptc-mediated repression of Smoothened (Smo).
  This allows Costal (Cos), which interacts with Fused (Fu) and Supressor of fused
  (Su(fu)), to induce proteolytic cleavage of the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus
  (Ci), producing the repressive form (CiR). CiR acts as a repressor of Hh target
  gene expression. In the presence of Hh, Smo represses Cos allowing the active form
  of Ci (CiA) to activate Hh target gene expression.B) Core components of the Hippo
  signaling pathway. When Hippo signaling is active the Hippo (Hpo) kinase phosphorylates
  itself and the components of the kinase cassette: Salvador (Sav), which acts as
  a scaffold between Hippo and Warts (Wts), as well as the Warts cofactor Mob as tumor
  suppressor (Mats). The activated Warts kinase phosphorylates Yorkie (Yki) and prevents
  its nuclear translocation. When the kinase cassette is inactive, Yki enters the
  nucleus and interacts acts as a transcriptional cofactor to induce target gene expression.
  In the FSC, Yki is regulated by the Hh signaling pathway both transcriptionally
  as well as post-transcriptionally and induces the expression of the cell cycle gene
  Cyclin E [,].'
