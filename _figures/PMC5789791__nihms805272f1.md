caption: 'A & B. Age and gender matched PANTG and WT mice at six weeks of age (N=3
  per condition) were exposed to three metabolic states prior to liver extraction:
  fed, fasted and insulin-stimulated. Livers were immediately extracted following
  exposure to described metabolic conditions, snap-frozen and stored at −80°C. C.
  & D. 40 mg of liver tissue were lysed in cold lysis buffer (100mM Tris-HCl, 100mM
  DTT, 4% SDS and 1x HALT protease inhibitor) prior to heating at 95°C for five minutes
  followed by brief sonication. Identical process was performed on lives obtained
  from metabolically labeled “SILAC” mice (Cambridge Isotopes). The “heavy” protein
  lysate was combined with each experimental mouse liver protein lysate prior to tryptic
  digestion utilizing the FASP (Expedeon) method. Samples were desalted using solid
  phase enrichment C18 columns (The Nest Group, Inc.). Prior to LC-MS/MS, sample complexity
  was reduced by strong cation exchange chromatography. E. & F. Each biological sample
  was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Normalized ratios from MaxQuant for each
  biological sample were inputted into the Perseus processing suite to determine statistical
  significance of quantitation values using a student’s two-tailed t test (p < 0.05)
  yielding 231 proteins in the fed condition, 246 proteins in the fasted condition
  and 191 proteins in the insulin-stimulated condition. Geometric means and Uniprot
  Protein Identification numbers were uploaded to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  for canonical pathway and network analysis altered in the liver of mice with increased
  circulating PANDER.'
