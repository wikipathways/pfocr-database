caption: Structural features and signaling pathway of RLRs. The structure and functions
  of MDA5 are like those of RIG-I. However, MDA5 lacks the repressor domain, which
  means it does not have self-inhibitory functions. LGP2, however, lacks the CARD
  domain and therefore cannot transmit signals. The binding of viral RNA to the CTD
  induces conformational changes in RLRs. These conformational changes facilitate
  the interaction between MAVS and either RIG-I or MDA5, which leads to the transcription
  of IFN-I via IRF3-, IRF7-, and NF-κB mediated pathways. LGP2, acts as a modulator
  and promotes MDA5-mediated signal transduction while suppressing RIG-I-mediated
  signaling
