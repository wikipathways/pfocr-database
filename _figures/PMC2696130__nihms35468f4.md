caption: A, in CF airways under high volume conditions, as in normal airways, any
  soluble regulatory molecules such as adenosine or secreted protease inhibitors are
  diluted and ineffective. Due to the lack of CFTR and its inhibitory effects on ENaC,
  ENaC is hyperactive leading to a more rapid baseline Na+ led volume absorption than
  in NL airways under high volume conditions with Cl- following through the paracellular
  pathway. B, as ASL volume is reduced, regulatory molecules such as ADO and CAP-inhibitors
  accumulate in the ASL. However, in the absence of CFTR activation of A2B-R is predicted
  to raise cAMP and stimulate rather than inactivate ENaC. Further, for reasons that
  are currently unknown, the CAP system is also dysfunctional and ENaC remains proteolytically
  cleaved despite a reduction in ASL volume. Thus, unlike NL airways, CF airways are
  unable to make the switch from an absorbing to a secreting epithelia and ASL volume
  depletion results. C, D, unlike NL airways, since ASL volume is already depleted,
  bumetanide and nystatin addition are without affect. Note, since ASL volume does
  not fall below ∼3 μm in airway epithelia, transcellular Na+ absorption will likely
  be offset by a backflux of Na+ through the paracellular pathway.
