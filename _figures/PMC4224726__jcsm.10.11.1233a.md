caption: 'Major pathways of cellular energy metabolism (A). Glycolysis in the cytoplasm
  is linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in mitochondria by the multi-component
  pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which irreversibly decarboxylates pyruvate
  acetyl CoA, an intermediate that is also formed as a product of the β-oxidation
  of long-chain fatty acyl CoAs (LCF acyl CoAs). Alternatively, pyruvate is carboxylated
  by pyruvate carboxylase to oxaloacetate. Reducing equivalents (nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide NADH; flavin adenine dinucleotide, FADH2) are generated by reactions
  catalyzed by the PDC and the TCA cycle and donate electrons (e−) that enter the
  respiratory chain (B) at NADH ubiquinone-oxidoreductase (Complex I) or at succinate-ubiquinone
  oxidoreductase (Complex II). Electrons from Complexes I and II are transferred via
  coenzyme Q10 to ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase (Complex III). Cytochromic oxidase
  (Complex IV) catalyses the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Electron transfer
  at Complex I, III, and IV is coupled to the pumping of protons (H+) from the mitochondrial
  matrix to the inter-mitochondrial space. These protons are utilized by ATP synthase
  (Complex V) to generate ATP from ADP, thus completing the process of oxidative phosphorylation.
  All the enzymes of the PDC, the β-oxidation pathway and the TCA cycle are encoded
  by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Of the approximately 97 subunits comprising the respiratory
  chain complexes, only 13 are encoded by mitochondrial DNA, and the rest are nuclear-encoded
  (mtDNA:nDNA): Complex I (7:∼46); Complex II (0:4); Complex III (1:10); Complex IV
  (3:10); and Complex V (2:14). Panel B from reference (used with permission).'
