caption: PDAC cells secrete various soluble factors, among which include TGF-β1, VEGF,
  FGF-2 and sonic hedgehog to recruit and activate PSC. In turn, activated PSC secrete
  cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, structural proteins and others, which promote
  PDAC progression including enhancing proliferation []. We showed that IL-6 and SDF-1α
  secreted by PSC activate their receptor and the subsequent downstream signaling
  cascade, via Nrf2 transcription factor. Increased Nrf2 activates metabolic gene
  expression that governs purine nucleotide and NADPH synthesis to promote ROS detoxification
  and cell proliferation. IL-6 is also known to activate JAK/Stat3 signaling pathway,
  which induce c-Myc transcription which is important for PDAC cell proliferation.
