caption: Loss of negative feedback contributes to resistance to Raf and MEK1/2 inhibitors.
  Raf or MEK1/2 inhibition (1) results in lower levels of negative feedback to upstream
  components (2). As a result, the cell is returned to an RTK signalling-competent
  state, where Ras and other upstream factors are able to respond to signal activation
  (3). Therefore, signal flux is increased (4), promoting higher ERK1/2 activity and
  requiring higher inhibitor doses. The increased Ras activity can also activate parallel
  pathways, such as the PI3K/Akt pathway (5). In addition, loss of negative feedback
  leads to the de-repression of other RTK receptors (6), allowing different growth
  factors to activate downstream signalling pathways. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
  can promote cell survival (7) and reduce the dependency of the tumour on ERK1/2
  signalling, likely contributing to the acquired resistance to Raf and MEK1/2 inhibitors
