caption: Apoptotic signalling in cisplatin-sensitive Germ Cell Tumours. Apoptosis
  is regulated at several levels with a key role for TP53, which transcriptionally
  regulates proteins involved in both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway,
  including FAS death receptor, BAX, PUMA, and NOXA. Activated TP53 enhances expression
  of the FAS death receptor. Binding of FAS ligand to FAS death receptor leads to
  cleavage of procaspase-8 and subsequently activates a caspase cascade leading to
  apoptosis. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is regulated by pro- and anti-apoptotic
  proteins. Pro-apoptotic proteins directly facilitate BAX and BAK oligomerization
  in the mitochondrial outer membrane, or they indirectly inhibit anti-apoptotic proteins.
  Crosstalk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways exists in form
  of caspase-8-mediated cleavage of BID.
