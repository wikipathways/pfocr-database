caption: P60TRP signalling based on the results obtained from different systems including
  NSCs, PC12 cells and p60TRP transgenic mice. P60TRP mediates neurosynaptogenesis
  by inducing PP2A activity which results in the dephosphorylation of App and the
  inhibition of Cdh2 cleavage through the inhibition of Psen. P60TRP also inhibits
  Bace1 (β-secretase)-mediated processing of App and promotes Adam10-mediated App
  cleavage resulting in enhanced production of sAppα and hence modulates synaptogenesis.
  Inhibition of Psen leads to reduced AICD signalling and neurogenesis as well as
  enhanced Mtap2 expression.
