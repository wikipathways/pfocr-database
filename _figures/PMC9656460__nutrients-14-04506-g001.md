caption: 'Key mechanisms of ferroptosis. The regulatory pathways of ferroptosis are
  mainly divided into three metabolisms (iron, lipid, and amino acid). By binding
  TFR1, cells take iron into endosomes as Fe3+. Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen
  of prostate 3 (STEAP3) helps reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+. Most Fe2+ can be stored in ferritin,
  utilized for enzyme synthesis, or exported by ferroportin (oxidized to Fe3+). The
  rest of Fe2+ may mediate Fenton reaction producing ROS. The accumulation of ROS
  will induce ferroptosis because it oxidizes PL-PUFA-OH into PL-PUFA-OOH, which can
  decompose to 4-hydroxy-2-nonenals (4-HNEs) or malondialdehydes (MDAs) that cause
  cellular damage. Another important cause of ferroptosis is reduced antioxidant capacity.
  The system Xc− transporter, consisting of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11)
  and solute carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2), releases glutamate in exchange for
  cystine, which can be further transformed into cysteine, a crucial component of
  GSH. With the help of GPX4, GSH can deoxidize PL-PUFA-OOH back into PL-PUFA-OH.
  GPX4 can inhibit ferroptosis by reducing ROS production and protecting cells from
  lipid hydroperoxides. In addition, the FSP1-CoQ10-NAD(P)H pathway, GCH1-BH4-DHFR
  pathway, mitochondria, and energy stress are involved in the progress of ferroptosis
  as well. GSSG: glutathione disulfide; L: lipid; -OHs: alcohols; -OOHs: hydroperoxides;

  phosphorylation; CoQ10H2: the reduced form of coenzyme Q10, ubiquinol; NADH: nicotinamide
