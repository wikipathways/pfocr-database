caption: Workflow for identification of vaccine candidates and vaccine formulation
  using high throughput omics techniques. The material of interest (DNA, RNA or protein)
  can be extracted from the desired parasite or from-infected host fish tissue. The
  isolated material serves as sample for next generation sequence analysis (for DNA
  and RNA) and spectrophotometry and Edman sequencing (for protein). The obtained
  sequences can be subjected to different bioinformatic tools for analysis and functional
  annotation of parasite molecules. Based on molecular function and biological pathway
  analysis, the immunogenic targets (capable of eliciting host immune response) can
  be selected and their protective epitopes predicted. These molecules can then be
  produced on a large scale and combined with suitable adjuvants to form vaccine.
  Subsequently, the vaccine thus produced can be used for conducting trials in suitable
  fish and its efficacy and appropriate route of administration can be determined.
