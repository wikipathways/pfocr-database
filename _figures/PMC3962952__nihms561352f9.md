caption: Unconventional pathways for cap formation. (a) Schematic of the proposed
  mechanism of mRNA cap formation in rhabdovirus with protein colored purple, catalytic
  histidine residue denoted in red, nascent mRNA colored red, terminal phosphates
  of nascent mRNA and phosphatases of the guanine nucleotide shown as yellow balls
  with phosphate positions labeled. (b) Schematic of influenza virus ‘cap snatching’
  indicating the host capped mRNA (blue), the viral RNA (red), the PB2 subunit (green),
  the PA subunit (orange), and the PB1 subunit (colored in cyan). (c) Schematic of
  the proposed pathway for capping in alphavirus. The nsP1 protein (pink) transfers
  a methyl group (green) from AdoMet (black) to GTP (blue and orange spheres) to generate
  N7-methyl GTP. The N7-methyl GTP is then used as a substrate to cap the viral RNA
  (red).
