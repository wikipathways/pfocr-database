caption: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate innate host immune response against influenza
  infection by targeting intracellular signaling pathways. Upon infection, influenza
  can activate different intracellular signaling pathways such as NF-κB, RIG-like
  receptor (RIG-I), TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), and interferon regulatory
  factors (IRFs) through different pattern recognition receptors including TLR3, TLR4,
  TLR7/8. TLR3 and TR7/8 that recognize double stranded RNA and single-stranded RNA
  in the endosome, respectively. The ligand for TLR4 in influenza virus is unknown;
  however, it is thought to be activated by the damage-associated molecular patterns
  molecules released in influenza virus-infected cells and trigger TLR4-MyD88-signaling
  pathways. Induction of these TLRs can lead to activation of NF-κB, IRF 3, 5, and
  7 and induce expression of type-I and -II IFN, IFN-stimulated genes, and inflammatory
  genes. Some miRNAs regulate these pathways through targeting critical components
  such as TRAF6, IRF3, IRF5, IFR7, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, and
  IκBβ. Within the infected cells, RIG-I detects the 5-triphosphorylated RNA of replicating
  viral genomes in cytosol and associates with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein
  (MAVS) to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and type-I IFN. miRNAs can modulate
  this pathway by directly targeting RIG-I, MAVS, or NF-κB-inducing kinase.
