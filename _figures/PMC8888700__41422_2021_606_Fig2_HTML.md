caption: a First described in Drosophila melanogaster, the original pathway of PcG
  recruitment relies on two sequential steps. First, PRC2 is recruited to chromatin
  and deposits the repressive H3K27me3 mark via its EZH1/2 subunit. The repressive
  mark is then recognized by the CBX2/4/6–8 chromodomain, a subunit of cPRC1. Lastly,
  RING1A/B deposit the ubiquitination on H2AK119 (in Drosophila, H2AK118). While in
  Drosophila melanogaster PRC2 recruitment depends on specific transcription factors
  binding to PREs, in mammals PRC2 recruitment can occur at CGIs or depends on transcription
  factors or lncRNAs. More recent data suggest an alternative recruitment pathway,
  in which ncPRC1 complexes are recruited in a KDM2B-dependent manner which deposits
  the H2AK119 ubiquitination mark. In turn, this mark is recognized by the JARID2
  subunit of PRC2.2. Furthermore, PRC2.1 binds the same targets via PCL1/2/3 proteins.
  Finally, cPRC1 is recruited via CBX2/4/6–8-mediated recognition of H3K27me3. Moreover,
  the new PcG proteins BAHD1 and BAHD2 have also been found to recognize the H3K27me3
  repressive mark. Their interactions with HDACs generate a hypoacetylated chromatin
  state which participates in transcriptional silencing. b Chromatin compaction impairs
  the transcription of target genes. c PcG-mediated silencing depends on the inhibition
  of the transcriptional machinery while the repressive PRC2 and PRC1 marks are necessary
  to inhibit the deposition of active histone marks. d PRC1 participates in the higher-order
  3D chromatin organization via its PHC subunits. The SAM domain of PHC-PRC1 is able
  to oligomerize which results in the maintenance of the transcriptionally repressed
  state. BAHD1, Bromo adjacent homology domain containing 1; CBP, CREB binding protein;
  HDAC, Histone deacetylase; RNA Pol II, RNA Polymerase II; SWI/SNF, Switch/sucrose
  non-fermentable.
