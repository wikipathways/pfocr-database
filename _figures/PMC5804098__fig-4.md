caption: Influence of CPI and PS48 treatment on gene expression and metabolite quantities
  in Warburg effect-related metabolic pathways in porcine fetal fibroblasts. Enzymes
  are in italic font and metabolites are in purple hexagons. The genes that were significantly
  impacted in fibroblasts treated with CPI and PS48 are in red font. Metabolites that
  were significantly impacted are outlined in red. This figure was modeled and adapted
  based on figures created by Vander Heiden et al. () and Amelio et al. (). Black
  arrows represent forward possible directions for metabolites and roles of enzymes.
  Red arrows indicate inhibitory roles of enzymes and CPI. Green arrow depicts PS48
  stimulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
