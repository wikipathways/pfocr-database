caption: 'Signaling pathways for neuroprotective effects of nicotine: Nicotine’s “outside–in”
  neuroprotective mechanism is its activation of surface nAChR, leading to Ca2⁺ influx
  and the upregulation of FGF-2 expression; nAChR activation also prevents neurodegeneration
  through mechanisms involving the activation of pro-survival signaling factors such
  as the PI3K, AKT, and Bcl proteins in the brain. Nicotine can increase the enhancement
  of nerve growth factor induced by α4β2-nAChR; in astrocytes cultured in vitro, the
  activation of α7-nAChR leads to the COX-2-dependent production of PGE2, thereby
  exerting neuroprotective effects. Nicotine’s “inside–out” neuroprotective mechanism
  involves its activity as a molecular chaperone of nAChR in cells, which can modulate
  protein kinase R-like ER-localized eukaryotic initiation factor 2α kinase (PERK)-activating
  transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)-X-box binding
  protein 1 (XBP1), thereby altering ER stress/the unfolded protein response (UPR),
  leading to transcriptional changes and neuroprotection'
