caption: The TST, CPT‐S‐PEG, and AZD4635 were co‐assembled into nanoparticles (CAT‐NP)
  through nanoprecipitation method. CAT‐NP can be passively targeted to tumor tissues
  through EPR effect after intravenous injection of Balb/c mice. The CAT‐NP showed
  enhanced NIR‐II imaging due to AIE property when the nanoparticles were intact and
  enhanced PTT when nanoparticles were disintegrated. PTT induced the ICD of cancer
  cells thus released large amounts of CRT, HMGB1, and ATP into the tumor microenvironment.
  But ATP was converted into immunosuppressant adenosine through the CD39‐CD73‐A2AR
  pathway. The AZD4635 released by the disintegrated nanoparticles can inhibit the
  binding of adenosine to the A2AR receptor of immune cells, thus enhancing the immunotherapy
  effect of tumors.
