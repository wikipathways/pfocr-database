caption: MAPK/JNK signalling cascades involved in the regulation of autophagy. Autophagy
  is induced in response to the absence of amino acids compared with other stresses
  and regulated by a complicated signalling network delivering to JNK1 (green arrowheads).
  Constitutively-activated JNK1 leads to Bcl-2 phosphorylation at the amino acid residues
  (Thr69, Ser70 and Ser87), which dissociates Bcl-2 from Beclin1 and constitutes the
  Beclin1-related PI3K III complexes (black cambered arrowheads) and as a result,
  regulates autophagy. The complexes (Beclin1–hVps34–protein X) play stimulatory or
  inhibitory roles in different stages of autophagy according to protein X (mainly
  detailed in ). When activated, JNK phosphorylates and thus activates c-Jun/c-Fos,
  enhancing its transcriptional activity of Beclin 1.Activated JNK also induces FoxOs
  nuclear localization and increases its activity to regulate transcription of other
  ‘core’ ATG genes.

  description: MAPK/JNK signalling cascades involved in the regulation of autophagy.
    Autophagy is induced in response to the absence of amino acids compared with other
    stresses and regulated by a complicated signalling network delivering to JNK1
    (green arrowheads). Constitutively-activated JNK1 leads to Bcl-2 phosphorylation
    at the amino acid residues (Thr69, Ser70 and Ser87), which dissociates Bcl-2 from
    Beclin1 and constitutes the Beclin1-related PI3K III complexes (black cambered

    X) play stimulatory or inhibitory roles in different stages of autophagy according
    to protein X (mainly detailed in ). When activated, JNK phosphorylates and thus
    activates c-Jun/c-Fos, enhancing its transcriptional activity of Beclin 1.Activated
    JNK also induces FoxOs nuclear localization and increases its activity to regulate
