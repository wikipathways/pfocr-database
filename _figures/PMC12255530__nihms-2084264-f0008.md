caption: Schematics are presented, showing an intratumoral serotonin axis regulation
  of CD8 T cell antitumor immunity. In this model, SERT restrains CD8 T cell antitumor
  responses by inhibiting the CD8 T cell-autocrine 5-HT signaling pathway in a solid
  tumor. CD8 T cells are major producers of 5-HT (or serotonin) in the tumor microenvironment
  (TME). Upon recognition of tumor antigen, tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells upregulate
  TPH1, which synthesizes 5-HT followed by releasing it into the TME to enhance T
  cell activation via 5-HT signaling. Meanwhile, tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells also
  upregulate SERT, which acts in a negative-feedback loop to downregulate T cell activation
  by terminating 5-HT signaling via the reuptake of extracellular 5-HT from the TME.
  Blocking SERT activity using established SSRI antidepressants accumulates 5-HT in
  the TME, leading to the activation of the 5-HTR-MAPK-TCR signaling pathway and enhancement
  of CD8 T cell antitumor reactivities. This local serotonin accumulation induced
  by SSRIs resembles the effect observed in neuronal tissues, where SSRIs block the
  reuptake of serotonin by the presynaptic neuron, thereby accumulating serotonin
  secreted by the presynaptic neuron and stimulating neuronal activity. Note SSRIs
  exhibit different effects on systemic serotonin, where SSRIs block platelet uptake
  of gut enterochromaffin cell (EC)-produced serotonin and deplete serum serotonin
