caption: A model for the requirement of upregulated expression of nutrient transporters
  for the enhanced proliferation of NK cells during MCMV infection. Following infection
  and inflammation, multiple pathways govern the proliferation of NK cells. Inflammatory
  cytokines, as well as the activating receptor Ly49H, contribute to the higher metabolic
  activity of proliferating NK cells. Among the multiple pathways, the MyD88 pathway
  plays an imperative role in NK cell proliferation. Higher expression of nutrient
  transporters is required to support the enhanced proliferation of NK cells during
  MCMV infection.
