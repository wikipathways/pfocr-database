caption: The protective effect of the Notch signaling pathway on B cells under irradiation
  exposure. After exposure to radiation, DNA damage and other associated harmful effects
  can lead to B cells exhaustion. Following radiation injury, the activation of Notch
  and its related signaling pathways facilitates DNA damage repair and promotes B
  cells survival. Subsequently, the relative enzymes are released and target specific
  sites (S1, S2, S3) within the Notch signaling pathway for cleavage in order to generate
  NICD. Once NICD enters the nucleus, it can recruit MAML and RBP-Jκ, releasing corepressors
  and recruiting coactivators. This process promotes the transcription of Notch target
  genes, such as Hes, Hey, and Dtx. Through the regulation of Notch signaling, it
  promotes the recovery of B cells after irradiation. NICD, Notch intracellular domain;
  RBP-Jκ, Recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region;
  MAMLs, Mastermind-like proteins
