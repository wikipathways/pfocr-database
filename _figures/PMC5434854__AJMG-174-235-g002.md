caption: Top ranking gene network by gScore from the gene list uploaded from the NRI
  versus control analysis. The pathway is highly enriched with fragments of canonical
  pathways and shows a gene‐network centered on the NF‐κB gene complex. NF‐κB is modulated
  directly by CREB suggesting an association with mechanisms involved in modulating
  inflammatory response. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com].
