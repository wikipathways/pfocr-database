caption: Schematic cellular model of the novel identified azo dye degradation pathway
  in S. decolorationis. OM, IM, MQ, EMred, EMox, ECEase, ICEase, LMPR1, LMP2, RA1,
  and RA2 represent outer membrane, inner membrane, menaquinone, electron mediator
  in the reduced state, electron mediator in the oxidized state, extracellular enzymes,
  intracellular enzymes, low-molecular product-1, low-molecular product-2, stress
  response protein-1, and stress response protein-2, respectively. Proteins colored
  in red are key components in the hypothesized azo dye biodegradation models. Proteins
  colored in green are those not identified in the Ni1-3 genome. The solid arrows
  represent reactions or electron transfer pathways that have been determined previously.
  The dotted arrows represent reactions or electron transfer pathways hypothesized
  in this study.
