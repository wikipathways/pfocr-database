caption: 'The PI3K-PTEN-mTOR pathway. Activation of PI3K pathway via exogenous stimuli,
  endogenous signals and/or mutations promotes cancer formation, progression and resistance
  to therapy. The major signal modulators are PI3K in green and PTEN in red. The PI3Ks
  are shown as a simplified heterodimeric complex that combines the PI3K regulatory
  and catalytic subunits discussed in this review. As seen in the schematic representation,
  activated upstream cellular receptors (i.e. RTKs, GFRs, GPCRs) lead to activation
  of PI3Ks, which phosphorylate the membrane phospholipid substrate (i.e PIP2 into
  PIP3). PTEN is a phosphatase that opposes PI3K action; therefore, mutation or ablation
  of PTEN leads to PI3K/mTOR pathway over activation. Next, AKT is translocated to
  the cell membrane and is phosphorylated by PDK1 and PDK2. Once AKT is activated,
  it inhibits TSC1/TSC2 complex, which leads to RHEB inhibition. mTOR complexes (mTORC1
  and mTORC2) collect the signals. mTORC1 activates downstream molecules. As a result,
  mTORC1 controls major processes, including cell cycle progression, growth, protein
  synthesis, lipid synthesis, and autophagy. mTORC2 functions are less understood,
  yet it is known to regulated, cell shape, cytoskeleton organization, cell survival,
  and cell metabolism. Therefore, PI3K/PTEN/mTOR pathway can control essential cancer
  cell processes, such as growth, invasion, metastases, and response to therapy. Black
  circles identify proteins that were found mutated in HNSCC. RTK: receptors of tyrosine
