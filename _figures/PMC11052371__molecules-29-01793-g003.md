caption: Diagram of the pathogenesis of acne and the mechanism of action of P. polyphylla.
  Inflammatory response, immune regulation, sebum dysfunction, microbial colonization
  and follicular hyperkeratosis are the driving factors in the development of acne.
  Peptidoglycan from P. acnes stimulates signaling in signaling pathways by binding
  to TLR2, promoting the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, and resulting
  in another large production of inflammatory factors, inflammatory mediators and
  angiogenic factors. At the same time, by promoting the differentiation of effector
  T cells into Th1/2/17, it inhibits the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ and promotes
  the production of the related factors IL-17 and IL-4, thus causing a disruption
  of the patient’s immune system. Androgens induce lipid synthesis by upregulating
  PI3K/AKt/mTOR, downregulating the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway and thus stimulating
  SREBP-1 production. As acne causes the production of IL-1α, which promotes the expression
  of K6/K16, it promotes the proliferation and differentiation of keratin-forming
  cells and induces the production of follicular hyperkeratosis. P. polyphylla can
  inhibit the production of inflammatory factors and angiogenic factors by suppressing
  related signaling, as well as modulating the immune system by promoting the production
  of IL-2 and IFN-γ and inhibiting IL-17 and IL-4. Secondly, P. polyphylla can promote
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling and inhibit PI3K/AKt signaling, a signaling pathway involved
  in lipid synthesis. Finally, P. polyphylla has an inhibitory effect on K6/K16 and
  regulates hair follicle hyperkeratosis. The red arrows indicate the promoting effect
  of P. polyphylla and the black arrows indicate the inhibiting effect of P. polyphylla
