caption: Protumor roles of ferroptosis in the tumor microenvironment. The accumulation
  of lipids, including cholesterol, fatty acids, or oxLDLs, in the TME induces the
  upregulation of CD36 on CD8+ T cells, which leads to further increased uptake of
  fatty acids and oxLDLs. Elevated fatty acid uptake by CD36 results in higher levels
  of PUFAs, increased lipid ROS, and enhanced ferroptosis. Ferroptosis of CD8+ T cells
  decreases effector function, impairs immune surveillance, and promotes tumor growth.
  Moreover, Gpx4 deletion or high-iron diet promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis via
  the release of oxidized nucleobases, e.g., 8-OHG, which activates the STING pathway
  resulting in increased macrophage activation and infiltration and tumor growth.
  Similarly, oxidative stress in pancreatic cancer cells results in autophagy-induced
  ferroptosis and the release of KRASG12D packaged in exosomes. Binding of exosomes
  containing KRASG12D to AGER receptors on macrophages induced polarization of macrophages
  to “M2” phenotype and increased tumorigenesis. 8-OHG, 8-hyroxyguanosine; AGER, advanced
  glycosylation end-product specific receptor; CD36, cluster of differentiation 36;
  Gpx4, glutathione peroxidase 4; oxLDL, oxidized low density lipoprotein; PUFA, polyunsaturated
  fatty acids; ROS, reactive oxygen species; STING1, stimulator of interferon genes 1.
