caption: A PIM1 enhances aggressive oncogenic characteristics in breast cancer through
  multiple mechanisms. PIM1 expression is triggered by estradiol in breast cancer
  cells, and this triggering is facilitated by ERα-regulated enhancers situated distally
  upstream from the gene. Increased PIM1 levels enhanced the proliferation of breast
  cancer cells, accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin-dependent protein kinase
  inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN2B. PIM1 was also transcriptionally activated by the IL-6/STAT3
  axis, playing a crucial role in promoting EMT and stemness in breast cancer cells.
  This process involves phosphorylation of c-Myc, a target/cofactor for PIM1, which
  contributes to MYC-driven tumorigenesis through phosphorylation of Histone-H3 at
  S10. PIM1 could enhance the stem cell-like traits of breast cancer cells by promoting
  the phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization of RUNX3. The translocation of
  RUNX3 from the nucleus hindered its function as a tumor suppressor, leading to the
  acquisition of stem cell traits by breast cancer cells. PIM-mediated phosphorylation
  inhibits CSL-dependent activity of Notch3 but promotes that of Notch1. Despite the
  difference, both cases of phosphorylation ultimately lead to increased tumor growth.
  Green circles show activating phosphorylation events. Green and red arrows represent
  activating and inactivating pathways, respectively. B PIM1 promotes prostate cancer
  through the phosphorylation of diverse substrates. PIM1 plays a crucial role in
  prostate cancer by phosphorylating the AR at S213, affecting AR target gene expression.
  Additionally, PIM1 targets the AR co-activator, 14–3-3 ζ, at S64, leading to alterations
  in AR transcriptional activity. PIM1 also phosphorylates the metastasis suppressor
  protein NDRG1 at S330, resulting in reduced stability, nuclear localization, and
  interaction with AR. PIM1 enhances NFATC1 transcriptional activity by phosphorylating
  it at S257 and S335, thereby promoting prostate cancer cell migration, invasion,
  metastasis, and tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, PIM1 phosphorylates Capza1 at
  S106 and S126, and Capzb2 at S182, S192, and S226, resulting in enhanced adhesion
  and migration of human prostate cancer cells
