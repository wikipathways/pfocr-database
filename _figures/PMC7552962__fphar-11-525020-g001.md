caption: Proposed model of interactions between ion channels and Wnt signaling. (A)
  KCNQ1 (or hERG) and ClC-2 are associated to E-cadherin and β-catenin at adherent
  junctions (AJ). Activity of these two channels maintain membrane potential hyperpolarized,
  which could be a favorable condition for AJ stability, and sequestration of β-catenin
  at the plasma membrane. CFTR activity maintains intracellular pH, preventing from
  pHi alkalinisation which induces Dishevelled-dependant inhibition of Destruction
  Complex (DC). These four channels participate in maintaining Wnt signaling in OFF-state,
  in which β-catenin is either degraded or sequestrated and cannot translocate into
  the nucleus to induce Wnt target genes. (B) Ca2+ entry through TRPC5, TRPM4, TRPV4
  and P2X7 channels, induces AKT activation. Thus, AKT phosphorylates GSK3-β which
  becomes inhibited and subsequently allows the cytosolic accumulation of β-catenin.
  ASIC1a, by maintaining an acidic pH, decreases β-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination,
  preventing its degradation and inducing a cytosolic accumulation.
