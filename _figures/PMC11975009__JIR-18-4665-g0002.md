caption: The Role of VPS35 in Neurodegenerative Diseases. (A) Mechanism of VPS35 D620N
  in PD. VPS35 D620N loses its ability to bind and transport M6P and LAMPs, leading
  to the accumulation of α-synuclein protein and the formation of Lewy bodies. Additionally,
  VPS35 D620N loses its capacity to bind and transport LRP6, resulting in the phosphorylation
  and degradation of β-catenin, which inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  and causes neuronal damage. (B) In AD, downregulation of VPS35 leads to the entry
  of APP into lysosomes in neurons, enhancing the production of Aβ. Simultaneously,
  it induces the phosphorylation and accumulation of Tau. In microglia, downregulation
  of VPS35 impairs TREM2-dependent endocytosis and autophagic flux of Aβ, causing
  further accumulation of Aβ and neuroinflammation. (C and D) Mechanisms of VPS35
  in RGCD and ALS. Downregulation of VPS35 in both diseases results in neuronal dysfunction
  and degenerative changes
