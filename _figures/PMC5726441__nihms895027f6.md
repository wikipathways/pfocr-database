caption: Adaptive resistance (in green, also labeled “1”) often involves upregulation
  of upstream regulators, including RTKs (HER3, INSR, IGF-1R), IRS-1, JAK2, or SRC
  by disruption of negative-feedback loops. Primary or acquired resistance (in red,
  “2”) can arise by expression or activation of kinases with downstream targets in
  common with AKT or mTORC1 (SGK1, PDK1, PIM1), constitutive activation of mTORC1
  signaling (e.g., due to loss of TSC function), or loss of PTEN expression. Primary
  or acquired resistance (in orange, “3”) can also arise by PI3K isoform switching;
  selective inhibition of p110α can lead to substitution by p110β or vice versa. Finally,
  primary or acquired resistance can also arise by activation of heterologous pathways
  leading to common endpoints; for instance, MYC-dependent transcriptional activation
  or ERK activity (in pink, “4”).
