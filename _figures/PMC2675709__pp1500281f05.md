caption: Comparison of metabolites and transcripts in glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle, and pH-regulating pathways between the wild type (WT) and the stop1
  mutant. Seedlings of the wild type and the stop1 mutant were grown for 10 d in stress-free
  control conditions, then transferred to low-pH (pH 4.5) solution and incubated for
  24 h. The transcriptomes of the stop1 mutant and the wild type on the pathway (222
  genes in Supplemental Table S3) were compared, while the metabolomes were compared
  between STOP1-KO and the wild type. Determined metabolites are shown in colored
  boxes, and the ratio of STOP1-KO to the wild type is indicated by color as shown
  at top right. Among the genes with intensities greater than 1,000, relatively more
  down-regulated (stop1 mutant/wild type < 0.8) or up-regulated (stop1 mutant/wild
  type > 1.25) genes than others are indicated in italics with the means of FC in
  parentheses (Supplemental Table S3). Asterisks show significant difference from
  FC = 1 (t test, P < 0.05). Transcript levels of selected genes in the wild type,
  the stop1 mutant, and STOP1-KO at pH 4.5 for 24 h are shown in small panels. Different
  letters in the small panels indicate significant differences by lsd test (P = 0.05).
  GABA shunt and biochemical pH stat pathways are emphasized by blue color.
