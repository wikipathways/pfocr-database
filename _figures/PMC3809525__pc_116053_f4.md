caption: Molecular Mechanisms of Callus Induction.(A) Auxin-induced callus formation.
  Auxin signaling is transduced via ARF transcription factors, especially ARF7 and
  ARF19, to activate the expression of LBD family transcription factors, LBD16, LBD17,
  LBD18, and LBD29. These LBDs in turn induce E2Fa, a transcription factor that plays
  a central role in cell cycle reentry. The PRZ1/AtADA2 protein mediates auxin-dependent
  repression of CDK inhibitors, KRP2, KRP3, and KRP7. How auxin modulates the expression
  and/or activity of PRZ1/AtADA2 is currently unknown.(B) Cytokinin-induced callus
  formation. Cytokinin signaling is transduced via two-component regulatory pathway
  to activate the type-B ARR transcription factors. The expression of CYCD3;1 is sharply
  upregulated by cytokinin, but whether it is directly activated by type-B ARR is
  not known. The AP2/ERF transcription factor ESR1 is also upregulated by cytokinin.
  ESR1 and its functionally redundant homolog ESR2 might mediate cell cycle reactivation
  since ESR2 induces the expression of CYCD1;1 as well as a DOF binding transcription
  factor OBP1. OBP1 is thought to promote the cell cycle progression by inducing expression
  of CYCD3;3 and several other cell cycle regulators.(C) Wound-induced callus formation.
  Complete excision of the Arabidopsis hypocotyls induces the expression of WIND1,
  WIND2, WIND3, and WIND4 genes at the wound site, which in turn upregulates the cytokinin
  response to promote callus formation. When Arabidopsis stems are half-cut, auxin
  transported from the shoot apex accumulates at the upper end of the wound site,
  which then induces the expression of ANAC071 gene. Auxin is depleted from the lower
  end, resulting in the induction of the RAP2.6L gene. Both of these responses are
  required for the local activation of cell proliferation to heal the gap at the wound
  site. Dotted lines indicate the wound site.(D) Callus formation by the reacquisition
  of embryonic or meristematic fate. Overexpression of each of the master regulators
  in the egg cell fate (RKD1 and RKD2), embryonic fate (RKD4, LEC1, LEC2, AGL15, and
  BBM), or meristem fate (WUS) is sufficient to induce callus formation. Proteins
  with confirmed function in callus formation are highlighted with white circles,
  while those inferred in callus formation based on indirect evidence are unmarked.
