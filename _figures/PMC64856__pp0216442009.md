caption: Network of metabolic pathways leading from Suc  (orange, top left) to the
  volatile phenylpropanoids, phenylpropenes,  and terpenoids formed in EMX-1 basil
  peltate glands (outlined with  yellow backgrounds). Blue, Enzymes for which cDNAs
  have been identified  in the basil peltate gland EST database, with the relative
  proportions  in the database indicated in parentheses. Black, Known enzymes for  which
  cDNAs have not yet been identified in the database. Red with  brackets, Proposed
  enzymes in phenylpropene pathway for which genes are  yet to be identified. Dashed
  lines, Hypothesized conversions. Green,  SAM, an important substrate for phenylpropene
  biosynthesis.
