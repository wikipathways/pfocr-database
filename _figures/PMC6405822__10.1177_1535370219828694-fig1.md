caption: BMP signal transduction. Bone morphogenetic proteins transduce signals in
  target cells by binding to a heterotetramic complex composed of two dimers of type
  I and type II receptors. This allows the constitutively active type II receptor
  to transphosphorylate the type I receptor, causing conformational changes that lead
  to activation of both canonical pathways and non-canonical pathways like the Rho-GTPase,
  JNK/P38, PI3K/AKT, and MAPK pathways. Through the canonical pathway, ligand-receptor
  complex formation leads to phosphorylation of R-Smads (Smad1/5/8), which are then
  able to form complexes with co-Smads (Smad4). Together, the complex translocates
  into the nucleus where it associates with coactivators and corepressors to regulate
  gene expression. BMP ligands can be regulated both by extracellular modulators including
  protein antagonists and by intracellular modulators like inhibitory Smads (Smad6/7).
