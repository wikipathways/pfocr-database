caption: (a) iAs detoxification by arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT) and glutathione
  (GSH) requires adenosylmethionine (SAM) consumption. In the transsulfuration pathway
  methionine is converted to SAM in an ATP-dependent reaction catalyzed by methionine
  adenosyltransferase (MAT). Subsequently, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is generated
  via the activity of a number of methyltransferases (MeTs). SAH is hydrolyzed by
  SAH hydrolase (SAHH) to adenosine and homocysteine. Homocysteine is conjugated with
  serine to provide cystathionine by the action of cystathionine beta synthase (CBS).
  Finally, cystathionine-γ-lyase (CTH, or γ-cystathionase) catalyzes the conversion
  of cystathionine to cysteine, which is used for de novo GSH synthesis, (b) If homocysteine
  is converted to cysteine and cannot be recycled re-methylated to methionine via
  the activities of betaine hydroxy methyltransferase (BHMT) or methionine synthase
  (MS) the SAM pool is depleted. SAM depletion will alter both DNA and histone methylation
  and the epigenetic signature in the brain that determines the expression of genes
  that might affect the neurodevelopmental processes. (c) Similarly, inhibition of
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) by iAs will impair Acetyl-CoA synthesis and as a consequence
  the acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases (HAT) and the epigenetic
  regulation of genes. CoA, coenzyme A; 5,10-MeTHF, 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate;
  2-MG, 2-methyl glycine; 5-MTHF, 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR, methyl tetrahydrofolate
  reductase; Pi, phosphate; PPi, diphosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
