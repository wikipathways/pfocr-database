caption: Model of the role of intracellular β-glucosidases in cellulase induction
  by lactose in T. reesei. Upon growth of cells on lactose, lactose is either hydrolyzed
  extracellularly by BGA1 or transported intracellularly by lactose permeases. Further
  processing of lactose by the intracellular β-glucosidases CEL1a and CEL1b is necessary
  to initiate the transcriptional induction of genes, including xyr1, crt1, and cellulase
  genes. A possible signaling cascade may exist that initiates from CRT1 and converges
  on the β-glucosidase-mediated pathway to ensure efficient induction (dashed line).
