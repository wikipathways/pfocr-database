caption: IPA generated networks derived from the proteins with different abundance
  in the chondrogenic, tenogenic and osteogenic constructs derived from young and
  old MSCs. IPA identified that lipid metabolism signalling pathways were predominant
  in chondrogenic constructs (a). In tenogenic constructs, signalling pathways were
  enriched for glucose metabolic processes (b). In osteogenic constructs, the principle
  signalling pathway was mitochondrial dysfunction (c). One of the principle functions
  associated with the DE proteins in tenogenic constructs was also protein metabolism
  (d). Green nodes, greater protein abundance in young; red nodes, greater protein
  abundance in old; white nodes, proteins not differentially abundant between young
  and old. Intensity of colour is related to higher fold-change. Key to the main features
  in the networks is shown
