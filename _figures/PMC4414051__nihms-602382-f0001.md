caption: 'So far, induction of apoptosis is the predominant route of HDACi-induced
  cell death. HDACi-mediated apoptosis is initiated by the hyperacetylation of histone
  and non-histone proteins: Core histone hyperacetylation results in an open chromatin
  that frequently correlates with gene activation. Non-histone protein acetylation
  can promote the induction of apoptosis by modulating protein function through altering
  their stability, cellular localization, and protein nucleotide /protein-protein
  interactions. In particular, A series of transcription factors (including NF-κB,
  p53, and signal transducers and activators of transcription – STATs) are directly
  acetylated by HDACi , which augments their capacity to bind DNA and selectively
  modulate the expression of apoptotic genes. Through the combined effects on histone
  and non-histone acetylation, HDACi activates either extrinsic pathway (such as up-regulation
  of death receptors and/or ligand expression) and (or) intrinsic pathway (such as
  decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2, Bcl-xL and enhanced expression
  of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bak) to induce apoptosis. HDACi can augment p21 expression
  in tumor cells, which can influence the decision of tumor cells to undergo apoptosis
  and/or cell cycle arrest following HDACi treatment. Moreover, HDACi-treatment causes
  the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through Trx down-regulation to possibly
  initiate or enhance apoptotic signalling in tumor cells. More recently, HDACi have
  been shown to induce tumor cell death with morphological features of autophagy,
  although there are doubts regarding the importance of autophagy and the pro-survival/
  pro-death function of autophagy in regulating the anti-tumor responses of HDACi.
  Several signaling pathways including ROS regulate HDACi-mediated autophagy. Another
  possibility is that HDACi may induce necrosis in tumor cells.'
