caption: The proposed model for the signaling events in mature, human oligodendrocytes
  in response to B. burgdorferi. Upon exposure to the bacteria, signaling events mediated
  by an as yet unknown receptor(s) lead to activation of various pathways, but predominantly
  the MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in release of specific inflammatory mediators. Thickness
  of the lines for MAPK/NFkB pathways depicts the attributed signal strength. Activation
  of the MEK/ERK pathway also leads to increased p53 levels, with the mitochondrial
  arm of p53 playing a role in apoptosis. Dashed lines depict undetermined possibilities

  Inflammation and P53-Mediated Apoptosis in Oligodendrocytes.
