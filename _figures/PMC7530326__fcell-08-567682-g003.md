caption: Dysregulation of BMP-ALK1-Smad4 signaling in HHTs. The mutant components
  within the BMP-ALK1 pathway including BMP9, ALK1, Endoglin, and SMAD4 are unable
  to suppress the transcription of CK2. Therefore, PTEN is phosphorylated by CK2 and
  loss the capacity to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway, which result in dysdifferentiation,
  disorganization, dilation and subsequent AVMs in cerebrovasculatures. Besides, AVMs-caused
  hypoxia increases the level of VEGFA, which subsequently binds VEGFR2 to active
  downstream PI3K/Akt signaling to aggravate the pathological process of AVMs. In
  addition, mutant SMAD4 increases the expression of angiopoietin-2 (Angpt2), leading
  to AVMs.
