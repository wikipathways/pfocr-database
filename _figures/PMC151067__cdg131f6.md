caption: Fig. 6. Proposed model of the MAPK pathway mediating ethylene signaling in
  plants. The histidine kinase ETR1 functions as an ethylene receptor and activates
  CTR1 in the absence of ethylene. CTR1 is a negative regulator of the MAPKK SIMKK
  and the MAPKs SIMK/MMK3 in Medicago, and MPK6/13 in Arabidopsis. In the presence
  of ethylene, ETR1 and CTR1 become inactivated, relieving SIMKK from inhibition.
  Subsequent activation of the MAPKs activates gene expression of ethylene-responsive
  genes via direct activation of EIN2 and EIN3 or through other factors.
