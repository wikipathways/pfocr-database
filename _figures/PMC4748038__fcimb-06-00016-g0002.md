caption: 'Shigella exploits Ca2+signaling to delay cell death and to dampen inflammation.
  Shigella invasion into host cell is perceived as genotoxic stress and induces apoptotic
  signaling mediated in part by the pro-apoptotic factor p53. Shigella, however, delays
  apoptotic cell death by different means: (i) promoting p53 degradation through Ca2+
  increase and VirA dependent activation of calpain and IpgD-dependent activation
  of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, (ii) maintaining mitochondria integrity by inhibiting
  Bax through Akt phosphorylation and NF-κB-dependent transcription activation of
  Bcl-2, (iii) inhibiting caspases by type III effectors. Shigella also dampens inflammation
  through IpgD-mediated closure of connexin hemichannel (Cx, in light violet) and
  calpain-mediated cleavage of Bid, which releases mitochondrial SMAC/OMI and antagonizes
  the inflammatory action of XIAP. Sustained cytosolic Ca2+ increase leads to mitochondrial
  Ca2+ overload, which induces a prolonged opening of the mPTP and ultimately necrosis.
  Necrosis is also promoted by pathologic activation of calpain. Altogether, the epithelial
  cell dies from a slow necrotic death. Plasma membrane permeabilization observed
  at later stages of infection might induce cytosolic Ca2+ increase, favoring necrotic
  cell death through mitochondrial overload. Dashed arrows indicate activation by
  an unknown mechanism. S. flexneri is drawn in blue. Type III effectors are labeled
  in yellow. Pathways hampered by Shigella are indicated in light gray. Lightning
  bolt represents genotoxic stress.'
