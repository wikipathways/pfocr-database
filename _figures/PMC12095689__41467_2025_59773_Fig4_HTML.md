caption: 'Schematic depicting proteomic and phosphoproteomics changes in the insulin
  signaling pathway based on the experimental design described in Fig. 3A including
  comparisons (detailed further in figure key) between the following groups: vehicle + PBS
  (VP), vehicle + insulin (VI), cotadutide + PBS (CP), and cotadutide +  insulin (CI).
  Due to space limitations, selected phosphosites are shown. *Indicates data derived
  from immunoblot or separate proteomic studies as noted in text. The full list of
  phosphosites is detailed in Supplementary Data. Created in BioRender. Kajani, S.
  (2025) https://BioRender.com/t41v037 (A). Immunoblot of phosphorylated AKT at serine
  473 from the groups described in Fig. 3A compared to total AKT (B). n = 4 mice per
  group. In (A, B), increased or decreased proteomic or phosphoproteomics changes
  based on p < 0.05 and abundance ratio <0.76 or >1.315, or p < 0.01 and abundance
  ratio <0.76 or >1.315, respectively. The in-built one-way ANOVA test in Proteome
  Discover (PD) was used to generate p values. Source data are provided as a Source
