caption: A model for functional antagonism between the PGD2-DP pathway and the PGE2-EP3
  pathway in development of allergic inflammation associated with asthma. PGD2 is
  released in response to mast cell activation and facilitates allergic inflammation
  at least in part by acting at DP in the airway epithelium. On the other hand, PGE2
  is produced in the surrounding tissues during mast cell activation and suppresses
  development of allergic inflammation by inhibiting induction of various asthma-related
  genes in the epithelium.

  description: A model for functional antagonism between the PGD2-DP pathway and the
    PGE2-EP3 pathway in development of allergic inflammation associated with asthma.
    PGD2 is released in response to mast cell activation and facilitates allergic
    inflammation at least in part by acting at DP in the airway epithelium. On the
    other hand, PGE2 is produced in the surrounding tissues during mast cell activation
    and suppresses development of allergic inflammation by inhibiting induction of
