caption: Dual thermosensory mechanism. This model illustrates a signaling pathway
  involving two thermosensors. When temperature stimulates GPCRs, PLC is activated
  by Gαq, producing DAG and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) from phosphatidylinositol
  bisphosphate (PIP2). DAG regulates the activity of thermo‐TRPs, which are also regulated
  by temperature changes, while IP3 stimulates IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (not shown). A similar signaling pathway is present in inflammatory responses, where
  TRPV1 and TRPA1 are regulated by GPCR for inflammatory mediators. GPCRs, G protein‐coupled
  receptors
