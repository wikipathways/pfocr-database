caption: Schematic representation of the effect of S3I-201 in obesity-induced extensive
  mammary hyperplasia. Obesity-induced aberrant activation of the STAT3 pathway contributes
  to the mammary hyperplasia via increased cell proliferation and EMT signals in ThrbPV/PVPten+/-
  mice. HFD induces elevated leptin to activate STAT3 signaling, resulting in increased
  cyclin D1, p-Rb, vimentin, and active MMP2 and decreased E-cadherin. All of these
  STAT3 downstream effectors are reversed by S3I-201 to attenuate STAT3 signaling,
  leading to reduced cell proliferation and decreased EMT signals.
