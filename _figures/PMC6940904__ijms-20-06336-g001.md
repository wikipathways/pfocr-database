caption: 'Overview of the complement cascade and principal complement targeting molecules.
  Three pathways can initiate complement cascade: (1) The classical, (2) the mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL), and (3) the alternative pathway. They all converge on C3 convertases
  formation which continuously cleave C3; after they are activated, the C3 convertase
  from alternative pathway dominates within an amplification loop that sustains the
  production of C3b (circular arrow). The three C3 convertases associate with an additional
  C3b to form the C5 convertases, which cleave C5 into C5a + C5b. C5b fragments recruits
  C6, C7, C8, and multiple C9 molecules to generate the terminal membrane attack complex
  (MAC); MAC inserts pores into cell membranes to induce cell lysis or activation.
  Anaphilotoxins C3a and C5a through their G protein-coupled receptors C3aR and C5aR,
  respectively, can promote signaling, inflammation, chemotaxis of leukocytes, vasodilation,
  cytokine and chemokine release, and activation of adaptive immunity. Dotted black
  arrows: inhibitor function of a complement effector on its target. Red arrows emerging
  from balloons: inhibitor function of anti complement drug on its target (bold drugs’
  names are the FDA approved ones). Full arrow: consequential interaction between
  complement fractions leads to the subsequent cascade step. Full bold arrow: final
  convergence of the three complement pathways on same final target. MBL: Mannose
