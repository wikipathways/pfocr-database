caption: '(A) A linear model for the ZBM hybrid NRPS-PKS templated assembly of the
  ZBM aglycone from nine amino acids and one acetate. Abbrevations for NRPS and PKS
  domains are: A, adenylation; ACP, acyl carrier protein; AL, acyl CoA ligase; AT,
  acyltransferase; C and C’, condensation; Cy, cyclization; KR, ketoreductase; KS,
  ketosynthase; MT, methyltransferase; Ox, oxidation; PCP, peptidyl carrier protein.
  (B) Proposed pathway for ZBM biosynthesis. [?] indicates a step whose enzyme activity
  could not be identified within the sequenced ZBM cluster. While all intermediates
  for ZBM biosynthesis are hypothetical, the analogous compounds, except the ones
  in brackets, have been identified in BLM biosynthesis from S. verticillus fermentation
  as the corresponding free acids.'
