caption: Metabolic refactoring in heterologous hosts a. Identification of biosynthetic
  gene clusters b. Consideration of the metabolic network and flux regulations in
  native hosts and non-native hosts using a synthetic biology approach c. Determination
  of the gene responsible for the compound of interest and causes for flux perturbations
  and upgrading the metabolic network using gene editing and promoter engineering
  followed by pathway refactoring in suitable heterologous hosts d. Post refactoring
  analysis in non-native hosts along with precursor input and metabolite output evaluations.
