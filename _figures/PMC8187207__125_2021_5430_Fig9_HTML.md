caption: Schematic overview of proposed skeletal muscle pathways affected by the 12 week
  intervention. (1) Combined aerobic and resistance exercise training resulted in
  increased SGMS1; sphingolipid metabolism via SGMS1 occurs at the Golgi apparatus
  through the transfer of a phosphocholine headgroup from PC to ceramide yielding
  a sphingomyelin (SM) and DAG []. (2) Exercise training results in content-driven
  increases in mitochondrial respiratory capacity that were associated with increases
  in DAG(32:2), cardiolipins and phospholipids. The increase was more prominent in
  PE compared with PC, resulting in decreased PC:PE ratios. Both PEs and cardiolipins
  are highly abundant mitochondrial lipids that contribute to mitochondrial respiratory
  capacity and content [, , ]. (3) Exercise training also increased medium-to-long
  chain acylcarnitines that were associated with increased mitochondrial respiration.
  Acylcarnitines shuttle fatty acids towards the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.
  (4) GLUT4 protein expression and whole-body insulin sensitivity increased with exercise
  training but were not related to change in muscle lipid signatures. (5) The SGMS2
  isoform located at the plasma membrane was not affected by the exercise training
  intervention. The control group increased skeletal muscle total lipid levels of
  (6) ceramides and SM and (7) TAG, which may have future implications for insulin-desensitising
  mechanisms []. There was no change in mitochondrial respiration or content in the
  control group. We hypothesise that exercise training increases lipid utilisation
  in the more bioenergetically active organelles and membranes. Specifically, increased
  mitochondrial respiration with exercise training may stimulate increases in SGMS1
  at the Golgi. SGMS1 produces DAGs that pool in the ER/Golgi network and produce
  phospholipid intermediates []. We propose that these phospholipid intermediates
  are imported into the mitochondria (via unknown mechanisms) and used as substrates
  for the synthesis of cardiolipins and PE []. This may be a pathway responsible for
  content-driven improvements in mitochondrial function, while preventing the build-up
  of DAGs at the plasma membrane where insulin signalling can be perturbed [, , ].
