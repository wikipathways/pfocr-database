caption: Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) functional mechanisms. (A) ALDH in normal
  and cancer cells. Retinol (vitamin A) absorbed by normal and cancer cells is converted
  to retinal in the cytosol. ALDH enzymes oxidize retinal to retinoic acid (RA). RA
  can be secreted and diffused into neighboring cells or translocated into the nucleus
  where it binds to dimers of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic X receptor
  (RXR), inducing the expression of its downstream target genes that are involved
  in differentiation, apoptosis, and growth inhibition. In ER positive cancer cells,
  alternative RA signaling induces the expression of genes related to cell proliferation,
  stemness, tumor growth and anti-apoptosis. RARE (retinoic acid response elements).
  (B) ALDH and CSCs. The Wnt pathway directly regulates ALDH1A1 through β-catenin/TCF-dependent
  transcription, promoting drug resistance and stemness. TGF-β downregulating ALDH1A1
  in Smad4- dependent manner. NOTCH signaling drives ALDH proteins deacetylation by
  SIRT2. In addition, ALDHs promote the oxidation of toxic reactive aldehydes into
  less toxic carboxylic acids limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and
  lipid peroxidation. (C) ALDH and immune tolerance. Cancer cells with high ALDH levels
  release factors including RA that in turns increase ALDH levels in several cells
  of the TME including macrophages (M0), dendritic cells (DCs) and normal epithelial
  cells. The consequent RA production enhances Treg differentiation from CD4 + T cells;
  increasing their activity thus leading to immune tolerance.
