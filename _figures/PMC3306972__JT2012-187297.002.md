caption: Schematic representation of the intracellular pathway by which AβPP and PS1
  control the activation of the MAPK/ERK1/2 cascade and their final biological effects.
  In the figure is specified the interaction between APP intracellular domain and
  PS1 C-terminus, with the adaptor protein Grb2. Grb2 can bind simultaneously to APP
  and PS1 (as measured in FRET experiments) leading to the MAPK ERK1/2 cascade activation.
  In AD an aberrant activation of ERK1/2 induced by APP and/or PS1 can determine the
  tentative activation of the cell cycle that, in postmitotic neurons, may induce
  cells to undergo apoptosis.
