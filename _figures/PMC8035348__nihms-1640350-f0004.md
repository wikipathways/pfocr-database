caption: 'Functional roles of lncRNAs and circRNAs in PDAC: The lncRNAs and circRNAs
  implicated in PDAC are shown. The left half of the circle shows the lncRNAs and
  their downstream targets, cellular phenotype and target genes or pathways affected.
  For example, HOTAIR interacts with EZH2 and binds to the promoter region of miR-34a.
  This binding leads to chromatin modification due to hypermethylation of miR-34a
  promoter repressing its expression. The lncRNA ENST00000480739 acts as an enhancer
  for OS9, increasing the expression of OS9. OS9 potentially binds to the ubiquitination
  complex comprised of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and other proteins which lead to the
  degradation of HIF-1α protein changing the hypoxic condition in the cells. The lncRNA
  PVT1 interacts with the SMAD2/3 proteins of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway, activating the
  expression of vimentin and inducing EMT changes in pancreatic cancer cells. The
  lncRNA MALAT1 interacts with EZH2 which in turn leads to the hypermethylation of
  E-cadherin promoter inhibiting its expression and increasing invasive potential
  of pancreatic cancer cells. The lncRNA HOTTIP regulate the expression of HOXA9,
  activating the Wnt-β-catenin pathway and increasing cancer stem cell properties
  of the pancreatic cancer cells. CircRNAs and their target miRNAs are shown in the
  right half of the circle. For example, circLDLRAD3 sequester miR-137-3p. In the
  absence of miR-137-3p, pleiotrophin (PTN) is expressed and leads to increased proliferation
  and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Circ0030235 inhibits the expression of
  miR-1253 and miR-1294 and leads to increased cell progression. Circ0007534 acts
  as a sponge for miR-625 and miR-892b and affects apoptosis. Circ-PDE8A targets miR-338
  activating the MET/AKT pathway and increase invasive potential of pancreatic cancer
  cells. Circ-IARS increases the expression of RhoA by inhibiting miR-122 increasing
  the permeability and invasive potential of pancreatic cancer cells.'
