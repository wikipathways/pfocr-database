caption: Wnt/β-cat signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of Wnt ligand, cytosolic
  β-cat is constitutively flagged for degradation by multi-protein complex comprising
  Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli (APC) protein, Axin, Casein Kinase 1 (CK-1), and Glycogen
  Synthase Kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β). (B) Wnt engagement of Frizzled (Fz) and low-density
  lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 or 6 (Lrp5/6) inhibits β-cat turnover, favoring
  nuclear translocation and activation of target genes, including the negative feedback
  regulators zinc and ring finger proteins RNF43/ZNRF3. These E3 ligases antagonize
  Wnt signals by ubiquitylating Fz receptors, promoting their destruction. (C) R-spondins
  synergistically promote Wnt signals by binding leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein
  coupled receptors (LGR4/5/6) and the E3 ligases RNF43/ZNRF3. This limits the ubiquitylation
  of Fz receptors, permitting enhanced activation of β-cat target genes. Non-canonical
  (i.e., β-cat-independent) Wnt signaling is not shown and described elsewhere ().
