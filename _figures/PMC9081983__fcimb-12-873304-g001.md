caption: 'Role of ncRNAs in EV71 invasion through blood-brain barrier. (A) Direct
  invasion. miR-23b and miR-2911 downregulate junction protein claudin-5 and upregulate
  EV71 receptor vimentin, resulting in damage to blood-brain barrier and the attachment
  of EV71 through modulating VP1 expression. (B) Retrograde axonal transport. miR-105
  and miR-9 can target peripherin, which facilitates EV71 attachment and replication,
  to modulate viral retrograde axonal transport. (C) “Trojan Horse” pathway. EV71
  can hijack immune cells to intrude CNS, miR-3473a may mediate leukocyte trans-endothelial
  migration and induce BBB disruption associated with EV71. “*”: non-EV71-infected
  disease model.'
