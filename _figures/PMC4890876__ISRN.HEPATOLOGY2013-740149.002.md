caption: Diverse stimuli from inside or outside the cell can cause apoptosis. Inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., TNFα) may continually induce the activation of caspase-8, caspase-3,
  and DNA fragmentation through membrane receptors. This apoptotic pathway, called
  the extrinsic pathway, is a direct activation of caspases. Intracellular metabolic
  disturbances or excess reactive oxygen species can hurt mitochondria and result
  in cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation. The activated caspase-9 further
  stimulates caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Because this type of apoptosis is
  from mitochondrion-mediated activation of caspases, it is thus named mitochondrial-dependent
  pathway or mitochondrial pathway. Sometimes, it is also called indirect pathway
  or intrinsic pathway. Mitochondrial dependent pathway is different from extrinsic
  apoptotic pathway, but two pathways are not mutually exclusive in liver. The mitochondrial
  pathway is very important during hepatic apoptosis, which is often required to amplify
  the relatively weak death receptor-induced apoptotic signal. Apoptotic causative
  factors are able to activate survival signals against cell death as well.
