caption: Summary of proteomics analysis of gastrocnemius and soleus muscle in the
  ET group. (a) Exercise-training-regulated proteins’ role in improving metabolic
  pathways (glucose and lipids), muscle regeneration, insulin sensitivity, antioxidant
  levels, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Red and pink muscle fiber types are denoted
  by I and II, respectively. Upregulated proteins are highlighted with a yellow background,
  while downregulated proteins are highlighted with a blue background. The anticipated
  increases and decreases in biofunction are represented by the orange and blue arrows
  pointing upward and downward, respectively. (b) The ameliorating effect of aerobic
  exercise on T2DM-induced sarcopenia through ECM remodeling in the gastrocnemius
  muscle via a TGF-β signaling pathway. Increases and decreases in DEP levels are
  represented by the black arrows pointing upward and downward, respectively. (c)
  Localization of DEPs linked to muscle regeneration in gastrocnemius muscle. DEPs—differentially
  expressed proteins, ECM—extracellular matrix, ET—mouse group (n = 4) that was subjected
  to a six-week aerobic exercise intervention, ROS—reactive oxygen species, TGF-β—transforming
  growth factor-beta, and SED—sedentary control group (n = 4)
