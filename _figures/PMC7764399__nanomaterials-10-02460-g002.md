caption: Various gut microbial stimuli due to dysbiosis can cause the initiation of
  inflammation in the intestine. The release of the proinflammatory cytokines inducing
  inflammation through various pathways assures the destruction of pathogenic microbes,
  and homeostasis is maintained when the resolution phase is used for controlling
  the inflammation and damage repair. Dysbiosis, combined with genetic defects, can
  omit the resolution phase with continuous chronic inflammation leading to the introduction
  of IBD. The pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) releases can activate the
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to initiate the regenerating islet-derived protein (REG)3,
  REG3 and defensin that promotes the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
  protein (NOD2) to release nuclear factor kappa B (NFB). A PAMP-activated TLR can
  also instigate the canonical pathway for the release of NFB through the activation
  of the kinase cascade that in turn activates the IKB kinase (IKK) complex where
  the degradation of IKK can release NFB into the nuclease. The NFB can act as a transcription
  factor in the production of various proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-8, and IL-6. TNF- can provide feedback for the further
  initiation of NFB. PAMP can also bind to the nod-like receptor (NLR) gene, the NLR
  family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) that activates IL-18 that can synthesize
  other cytokines. A defect in the IL23R gene is responsible for the depletion of
  IL-23 that can be involved in the upregulation of IL-12 that stimulates inflammation.
  Chronic inflammation can lead to colorectal cancer, which is also influenced by
  the activation of NFB. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3),
  along with NFB, can upregulate the antiapoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2,
  Bcl-3, and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xl), and it can diminish the apoptotic
  Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax). This can irregulate caspase activity, thereby
  increasing the tumorigenic proliferation of susceptible cells developing into colorectal
  cancer. Image developed using Biorender.com.
