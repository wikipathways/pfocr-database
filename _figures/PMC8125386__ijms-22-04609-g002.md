caption: Salt stress triggers ion transport regulation in plant cells. Salt stress
  induces the accumulation of Na+ and Ca2+ within the cell. The glucuronosyltransferase
  monocation-induced Ca2+ increases 1 (MOCA1) is as a Ca2+-permeable channel in the
  plasma membrane. Glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramide (GIPC) sphingolipids sense
  and bind to Na+ to activate the MOCA1-mediated Ca2+ influx. The cyclic nucleotide-gated
  ion channel (CNGC) and high-affinity potassium (K+) transporter (HKT1) are required
  for Na+ transport into the cell. The inward-rectifier K+ channel Arabidopsis K+
  transporter (AKT1) and the outward-rectifier K+ channel guard cell outward-rectifier
  K+ channel (GORK) help to maintain the Na+/K+ balance. The salt overly sensitive
  (SOS) pathway plays essential roles in Na+ exclusion. The calcium sensor, SOS3/SCaBP8,
  recruits SOS2 to the plasma membrane and promotes SOS2-mediated phosphorylation
  of the Na+/H+ antiporter SOS1. Under normal conditions, the kinase SOS2 is repressed
  by 14-3-3, ABA insensitive 2 (ABI2), and GIGANTEA (GI). Additionally, SOS2-like
  protein kinase 5 (PKS5) phosphorylates and inhibits SOS2. Under salt stress conditions,
  14-3-3 and GI are degraded and release SOS2 to phosphorylate SOS1. Then, 14-3-3
  represses PKS5, thereby activating SOS2. Under salt stress conditions, the glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) kinase, brassinosteroid insensitive 2 (BIN2) fine-tunes
  the SOS2 activity to prevent overactivation. As a putative Ca2+-permeable transporter,
  the ANNEXIN protein member, ANN4, interacts with SCaBP8 and SOS2 and regulates calcium
  signaling under salt stress. During salt stress, SOS2 activates the vacuolar H+/Ca2+
  antiporter CAX1 to promote Ca2+ enhancement and regulates the vacuolar K+/H+ exchanger
  NHX to maintain the K+ balance. The arrows and bars indicate positive and negative
  regulation, respectively. Solid lines and dashed lines indicate direct regulation
  and indirect regulation, respectively.
