caption: The extrinsic pathway requires activation of a death receptor, such as the
  Fas receptor, which triggers the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex
  with FADD and procaspase-8 or -10. Generation of the active caspase then results
  in cleavage of Bid to tBid, which translocates to mitochondria and initiates the
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization facilitated by Bax and Bak, which
  triggers the release of cytochrome c. This enables formation of the apoptosome and
  subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Active caspase-3 cleaves ICAD
  to release CAD, which translocates to the nucleus and initiates nuclear DNA fragmentation.
  Caspase 3 can also promote procaspase-8 cleavage and further amplify the pro-apoptotic
  signaling loop through the mitochondria. The intrinsic pathway for apoptosis is
  activated by cellular stress signals, which activate Bax and its translocation to
  the mitochondria, which then follows signaling events similar to the extrinsic pathway
  downstream of the MPT.
