caption: Representative biosynthetic pathway of cucurbitacins in Cucurbitaceae and
  steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in Solanaceae. (A) represents the biosynthesis of
  cucurbitacins through enzymes encoded by the cucurbitacin gene cluster. The first
  step in cucurbitacin biosynthesis occurs by the enzymatic conversion of 2,3-oxidosqualene
  to cucurbitadienol mediated by enzyme Bitterness (Bi) belonging to oxidosqualene
  cyclase family. Cucurbitadienol is converted to cucurbitacin C (CuC) in Cucumis
  sativus mediated by CYP450s and acyltransferase [C. sativus acyltransferase (CsACT)].
  In Cucumis melo, cucurbitadienol is converted to cucurbitacin B (CuB) by CYP450s
  and C. melo acyl transferase (CmACT). Modification of the backbone in different
  Cucumis species is attributed to the activity of CYP450s. (B) represents the biosynthesis
  of SGAs from cholesterol using the enzymes encoded by the SGA gene cluster. α-solanine
  and α-chaconine are the signature metabolites of potato (Solanum tuberosum). In
  potato, cholesterol is converted to solanidine by catalytic reactions of GAME8 (glycoalkaloid
  metabolism), GAME6, GAME11, and GAME12. Further, solanidine is converted to α-solanine
  and α-chaconine by Sterol alkaloid glycosyl transferases (SGT1, SGT2, SGT3). α-tomatine
  is produced in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) through a similar set of genes present
  in the SGA gene cluster. Tomatidine is formed by the modification of cholesterol
  mediated by GAME6, GAME8, GAME11, GAME4, GAME12, and GAME25, respectively. Tomatidine
  is conjugated with four sugar moieties [one moiety each of galactose and xylose
  and two moieties of glucose] by UDP-glycosyl transferases, GAME1, GAME17, GAME18,
  and GAME2, respectively. Genes of the plant metabolic cluster encoding enzymatic
  reactions are indicated in red arrows. Dotted arrows represent a multi-step pathway.
