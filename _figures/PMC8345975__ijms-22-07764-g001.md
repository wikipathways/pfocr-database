caption: Regulators of the cardiomyocyte cell cycle. Summary of signaling pathways,
  cell cycle genes, and extracellular stimuli that induce cardiomyocyte proliferation,
  as discussed in this review. This includes cell cycle promotors and inhibitors,
  both the hippo and neuregulin pathways, microRNAs, and metabolic regulators, such
  as hypoxia and PDK4. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases promote cell cycle activation
  and progression, while cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21, p27, and
  p57 inhibit the cell cycle. In the hippo pathway, activation of upstream kinases
  (Mst1/2, Sav1, Mob1/2, and Lats1/2) phosphorylate the downstream transcription co-activators
  (YAP/TAZ) to promote their degradation. However, inactivation of upstream kinases
  causes YAP/TAZ to translocate to the nucleus to promote cell cycle re-entry in cardiomyocytes.
  Neuregulin (NRG1) binds to its tyrosine receptor subunits (ERBB2 and ERBB4) to activate
  a downstream signaling pathway (PI3K/AKT) and induce myocyte proliferation. Several
  microRNAs (miRNAs) also regulate the cell cycle to influence new myocyte formation.
  Hypoxia and PDK4 lead to a metabolic switch in cardiomyocytes from mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis for energy production. This metabolic
  change influences cell cycle activation in cardiomyocytes. PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 4.
