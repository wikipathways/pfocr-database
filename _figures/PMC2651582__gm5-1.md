caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells. The alteration of bioenergetic pathways
  in tumor cells is evident from their increased glucose uptake (a) through glycolysis
  (b), the intermediate metabolites of which are also shuttled into biosynthetic pathways
  (synthesis of nucleic acids from glucose 6-phosphate through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (c), amino acids from glycerate 3-phosphate (not shown) and lipogenesis
  from pyruvate (d)) that are necessary for cell growth and proliferation. In tumor
  cells, pyruvate in the mitochondria is shuttled into a truncated tricarboxylic acid
  cycle where it is converted to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase and combined
  with oxaloacetate for export into the cytosol as citrate for the synthesis of isoprenoids,
  cholesterol and fatty acids. Open up and down arrows indicate upregulation and downregulation
  of enzymes, respectively. Enzymes upregulated by activation of HIF-1 are in red.
