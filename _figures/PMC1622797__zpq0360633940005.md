caption: Proposed molecular model of dietary omega-3 fatty acid interference with
  IL-1 signaling pathways leading to COX-2 induction in EC. IL-1 binds to the IL-1
  receptor type I (IL-1RI), which heterodimerizes with the IL-1 receptor accessory
  protein (IL-1RAcP). The IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAK) are then recruited and associated
  by the adapter proteins myeloid differentiation factor(MyD)88 and Toll-interacting
  protein (Tollip). The signaling pathway also includes the production of ROS (H2O2)
  through the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase by IRAK activation, as well as the activation
  of PKC, both contributing to NF-κB activation. DHA, by interfering with the production
  of ROS (through the inhibition of p47phox translocation and/or the scavenging of
  ROS by its multiple double bonds), would prevent the formation of H2O2, thus limiting
  all of the downstream cascade leading to COX-2 gene expression. Furthermore, DHA
  reduces PKCε activation, thus inhibiting ERK1/2 activation, also leading to NF-κB
  activation and COX-2 expression. TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; TAK-1, TGFβ-activated
  kinase 1; TAB-2, TAK1-binding protein 2; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase.
