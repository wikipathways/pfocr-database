caption: Schematic representation of purine (A) and pyrimidine (B) metabolic pathways
  of C. cellulovorans. C. cellulovorans genes encoding each pathway enzyme is indicated.
  Red and green colors were used for gene loci whose protein product was over- or
  under-expressed in butanol-challenged cells, respectively. Geni loci whose protein
  product was identified in this study but was in similar amounts in butanol-supplemented
  and control cultures were indicated in black, while blue indicates geni loci whose
  protein product was not identified in the present investigation. Add, adenosine
