caption: 'The scheme depicts the three major ascorbate biosynthetic pathways found
  in eukaryotes (; ; ). The plant pathway (also known as the Smirnoff-Wheeler or D-mannose/l-galactose
  pathway) involves no inversion of the carbon chain (i.e., C1 of D-glucose becomes
  C1 of l-ascorbate), whereas the euglenid and animal pathways involve inversion of
  the carbon chain in the conversion from uronic acid to aldonolactone (i.e., C1 of
  D-glucose becomes C6 of l-ascorbate). Our analyses focus on enzymes with a dedicated
  role in ascorbate biosynthesis (shown in red): GULO—l-GulL oxidase; VTC2—GDP-l-galactose
  phosphorylase; VTC4—l-galactose-1-phosphate phosphatase; l-galDH—l-galactose dehydrogenase;
  GLDH—l-GalL dehydrogenase. The other enzymes are: PGM—phosphoglucomutase; UGP—UDP-D-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase; UGDH—UDP-D-glucose dehydrogenase; UGUR—UDP-glucuronidase; GlcUAR—D-glucuronate
  reductase; SMP30—regucalcin/lactonase; GAE—UDP-D-glucuronate-4-epimerase; GalUAR—D-galacturonate
  reductase. Enzyme names are not listed for steps where multiple enzymes may be involved
  or where specific enzymes have not been identified.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06369.003'
