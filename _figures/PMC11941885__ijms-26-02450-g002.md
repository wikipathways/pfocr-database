caption: Schematic representation of immune-mediated podocyte injury. Podocytes interact
  with immune cells through major histocompatibility complex type I (MHC I) and II
  (MHC II) but also possess co-stimulatory molecules for B lymphocytes (CD86) and
  for T lymphocytes (CD80). Imbalance between effector and regulatory T lymphocytes,
  interleukin/cytokine synthesis, and B cell-mediated antibody synthesis against podocyte
  structures can occur due to podocyte interaction with immune cells. Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs) can detect signals like pathogen-related molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-related
  molecular pattern (DAMPs) both from outside (e.g., lipopolysaccharide, lipids, and
  proteins) and within the cell (e.g., free nucleic acids). Upon binding TLRs, increased
  transcription of inflammatory genes (NF-kß, IRF3, IRF7, and AP1) and inflammasome
  activation are mediated through intracellular signaling proteins such as TIRAP,
  MyD88 and MAPK, ultimately resulting in cytoskeleton rearrangement and apoptosis.
  Interleukin receptors (IL Rs) and interferon receptors (INF Rs) also increase the
  transcription of inflammatory and profibrotic factors through the JAK/STAT signaling
  pathway. Complement-mediated podocyte injury can occur due to sub-lytic amounts
  of membrane attack complex (MAC). The activation of the NF-kß pathway and a rapid
  increase in intracellular Ca2+ induce NFk-ß-mediated inflammatory response, mitochondrial
  stress, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. The lack of inhibitor
  factors such as CD55 or complement factor H (FH) can trigger and intensify MAC production.
