caption: 'Cell type-specific signaling pathways activated by GPER on neurons and astrocytes.On
  neuronal cells the activation of GPER is associated to an increase of neuronal survival,
  via the increase of cAMP levels and the activation of MAPK and CREB pathways, and
  via the activation of PI3K pathway. On astrocytes the activation of GPER is associated
  to a reduction of cAMP levels and to cell death due to the activation of PLC pathway
  and consequent rise in intracellular calcium levels. GPER: G protein-coupled estrogen
  receptor 1; AC: adenylate cyclase; CREB: cAMP response element-binding protein;
  cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate; GPER: G protein-coupled estrogen receptor
  1; [Ca2+]: intracellular calcium; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K:
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PLC: phospholipase C; Akt: protein kinase B.'
