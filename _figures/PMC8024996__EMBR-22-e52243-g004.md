caption: Viral entry into cells results in release of viral DNA into the host cytoplasm.
  Viral DNA may be recognised by cGAS, resulting in activation of the cGAS‐STING immune
  signalling pathway and downstream activation of NF‐κB and p‐IRF3. NF‐κB transcribes
  pro‐inflammatory SASP genes while p‐IRF3 can induce transcription of IFN‐β. IFN‐β
  can activate p16 and p21 tumour suppressors to induce growth arrest. Viruses may
  themselves induce activation of NADPH and xanthine oxidases, resulting in ROS accumulation.
  ROS can induce DNA damage and expression of FOXA1 to induce p16 transcription of
  LINE‐1 elements. LINE‐1 retrotransposons are reverse transcribed, and DNA elements
  are recognised by cGAS. E2F inhibition by RB in senescent cells also results in
  downregulation of TREX1 and DNase2, allowing DNA fragments to accumulate in the
  cytoplasm.
