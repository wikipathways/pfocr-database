caption: Hypothetical mechanism of EGCG inhibition of AFB1 biosynthesis in A. flavus.
  EGCG perturbed MAPK signaling pathway by decreasing the level of intracellular ROS.
  Simultaneously, the decrease of phosphorylated SakA level might reduce the tolerance
  to oxidative stress, leading to the activation of bZIP transcription factor AtfA
  in the stress signaling pathway. The decreased expression of genes in AFB1 cluster
  might then be the most down-stream response to the modulation by bZIP transcription
  factor.
