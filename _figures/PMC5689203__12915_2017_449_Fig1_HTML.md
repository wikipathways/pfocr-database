caption: Schematic representation of secretory protein folding and quality control,
  the unfolded protein response pathway, and the heat shock response. In the endoplasmic
  reticulum, unfolded proteins (black lines) can be recognized and bound by chaperones,
  such as BiP (yellow circles). The increase in the concentration of BiP-unfolded
  protein complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum favors induction of the unfolded
  protein response (UPR). The UPR is regulated by ATF6 (light blue rectangle), PERK
  (green dimers), and IRE1 (orange dimers), which reside in the endoplasmic reticulum
  membrane. Upon activation, the UPR can increase cellular folding capacity by increasing
  chaperone synthesis, inducing endoplasmic reticulum expansion, and increasing the
  concentration of components of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation
  (ERAD) machinery. During ERAD, unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum are
  recognized, ubiquitylated by E3 ubiquitin ligases, and retrotranslocated via the
  action of p97 (blue circle), an AAA-ATPase, to the cytosol where they are degraded
  by the proteasome. Misfolded, aggregation-prone proteins, protein aggresomes, and
  damaged organelles can alternatively be targeted for autophagy via encapsulation
  in double membrane vesicles known as autophagosomes (light brown vesicles). LC3BII
  is an established marker of cellular autophagy and is associated with autophagosome
  membranes (light green circles), and proteins can be directed to autophagy degradation
  via HDAC6 (purple hexagon). Upon fusion with lysosomes (red vesicles), the material
  incorporated in the autophagolysosome is degraded (orange vesicles). In the absence
  of stress, HSF1, HSP90, HSP70, and HDAC6 can form a complex in the cytoplasm. During
  stress (for example, an increase in the concentration of unfolded protein or heat),
  HSF1 (orange rectangle) can translocate to the nucleus and induce the transcription
  of other proteins, like chaperones, to increase the cellular folding capacity. This
  is known as the heat shock response. At the same time, Hsp90 and Hsp70 (green and
  white rounded rectangles, respectively) are involved in cytoplasmic protein folding,
  dictating the fate of their clients. If the client fails to attain its final conformation,
  it will be ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome
