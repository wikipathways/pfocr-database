  description: 'The effects of polyphenols on signaling pathways in prostate cancer.
    In the canonical pathway ARs are activated by DHT binding. AR can be transactivated
    in the absence of DHT through different signaling pathways: increased activity
    of RTK or interleukin receptors and their signaling pathways, modifications of
    the coregulatory proteins, or constitutively activated AR [,]. Ligand binding
    to RTK activates PI3K/Akt kinases, which trigger the activation of IKK. This pathway
    induces phosphorylation of IκB, resulting in its ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated
    degradation. NF-κB is maintained in the cytoplasm by the interaction with IκB,
    and degradation of IκB activates NF-κB, which in turn is enabled to enter the
    nucleus and activate the genes involved in cell survival [,]. For simplification,
    the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation that takes place through the members
    of tumor necrosis factor receptors or interleukin receptors is omitted from the
    figure []. Similarly, the canonical pathway of PI3K/Akt signaling is not presented.
    Polyphenols might modulate the levels of signaling molecules in prostate cancer
