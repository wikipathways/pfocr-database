caption: 'Molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of EETs. EETs
  suppress the MMP-2 and MMP-9 to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction. EETs induce the
  expression of BDNF, then stimulate BDNF-TrkB signaling. Subsequently, BDNF-TrkB
  signaling stimulates the MEK–ERK–CREB signaling pathway, promoting neurite outgrowth,
  neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, EETs reduce oxidative stress
  and suppress ER stress through suppression of NF-kB and activation of Bcl-2, respectively.
  Moreover, EETs protect against apoptosis through suppressing the BAX and Caspase-3;
