caption: Glycolysis provides important intermediates for anabolic processes. Glucose
  is transported into the cell via glucose transporters and first converted into glucose-6-phosphate
  by hexokinase (HK) and subsequently converted into fructose-6-phosphate. Alternatively,
  it acts as a substrate for the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) to generate
  ribulose-5-phosphate, thereby also generating reducing equivalents in the form of
  NADPH. Fructose-6-phosphate is converted into fructose-1,6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase
  1 (PFK-1) or it can be utilized in the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (non-oxPPP),
  ultimately resulting in ribose-5-phosphate generation. Moreover, the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) utilizes fructose-6-phosphate, together with glutamine,
  to generate glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) via glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate
  aminotransferase (GFAT). Subsequently, the end product UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-N-GlcNAc)
  is generated in a multi-step conversion. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate generated by
  aldolase (ALDO) and triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) further undergoes glycolysis.
  After conversion into 1,3-BP-glycerate via glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase
  (GAPDH), the glycolytic intermediate 3-P-glycerate is generated via phosphoglycerate
  kinase (PGK) and converted into pyruvate by pyruvate kinase (PK). It can also be
  used for the synthesis of amino acids. Pyruvate is either converted into lactate
  by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), used to generate amino acids, or enters the mitochondria
  to fuel the TCA cycle.
