caption: Conversion from normal fibroblasts (NFs) to cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAFs) involves multiple molecular mechanisms. a) Growth factors and cytokines like
  transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), osteopontin (OPN), and IL-1β interact
  with their respective receptors in NFs, subsequently activating downstream effectors
  such as miRNAs and CD44 (61–63). These molecules modulate the expression of genes
  associated with the CAF phenotype through the TGF-β/Smads and NF-κB signaling pathways
  (64, 65). b) Exosomes derived from cancer cells, carrying entities such as miRNAs
  and lncRNAs, induce the transformation of NFs into CAFs (65). This conversion is
  facilitated by signaling pathways including TGF-β/Smads, JAK/STAT, NF-κB, and MAPK
  cascades. c) The shift from NF to CAF is also driven by alterations in glucose metabolism,
  with the HIF-1α signaling pathway playing a crucial role in this metabolic reprogramming
  (66). d) Variations in cellular homeostasis prompt a self-driven transition to CAFs
  by regulating the activation of cytoskeletal proteins and the secreted phenotype,
  primarily through the JAK/STAT and p53 signaling pathways (67)
