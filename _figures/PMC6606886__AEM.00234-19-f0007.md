caption: Schematic of the regulation network of RpoX in V. alginolyticus. Pathway
  analysis was performed with the Kobas 3.0 algorithm. The various pathways and their
  respective cellular locations, as well as the regulatory roles of RpoX, are illustrated
  with arrows (activation) or bar-ended lines (repression) and are discussed in the
  text. 3P, 3-phosphate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
