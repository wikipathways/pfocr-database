caption: Nucleolar stress model of cell cycle arrest due to perturbation in ribosome
  biogenesis. Expression of mutant proteins such as Bop1Δ, exposure to chemical inhibitors
  of synthesis, and maturation of rRNA and other ribosome components in mammalian
  cells induce nucleolar stress, causing cell cycle arrest by triggering activation
  of the p53 pathway. p53 is required for sensing cellular stress caused by a variety
  of conditions, including DNA damage, replication defects, and gratuitous oncogene
  expression.
