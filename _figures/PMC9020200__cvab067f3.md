caption: Segments of a knowledge graph containing relationships in metabolic and CV
  disease. (A) An example is shown using a knowledge graph to illustrate five types
  of concepts (colored shapes) along with their relationships (lines denoting their
  relationships). A knowledge graph is constructed through information extraction
  from biomedical literature available in PubMed and from established knowledgebases
  (e.g. protein–protein interactions from IntAct and tissue-specific SNPs from the
  GTEx database). Relationships are data type specific, e.g. a protein connected to
  a pathway (here, from the Reactome knowledgebase) indicates the protein participates
  in the pathway. (B) A more complex KG, consisting of >5700 aggregated concepts and
  >21 000 relationships with respect to SNPs, proteins, and pathways.
