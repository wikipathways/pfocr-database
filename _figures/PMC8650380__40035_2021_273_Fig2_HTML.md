caption: 'The pathological mechanisms underlying the effect of gram-negative bacteria
  in Alzheimer’s disease. The gram-negative bacteria produce a variety of exotoxins,
  such as gingipain, methylglyoxal (MG), bacterial amyloid, vacuolating cytotoxin
  (VacA), bacterial amino-acid, heme carrier protein (Hcp1), matrix metalloproteinase-8
  (MMP8), phosphorylcholine, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), and tryptophan. The gram-negative
  bacteria and exotoxins can penetrate the BBB and affect the AD-related pathology.
  Concerning Aβ aggregation, MG and gingipain are involved in the increase of Aβ production;
  bacterial amyloid and gram-negative bacteria can induce Aβ aggregation. Concerning
  hyperphosphorylated tau and neurofibrillary tangles, gingipain, MG, and gram-negative
  bacteria can provoke the hyperphosphorylation of tau; gingipain and gram-negative
  bacteria can also promote the aggregation of phosphorylated tau. Concerning neuroinflammation,
  the Aβ-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes contributes to a neuroinflammatory
  response, affecting neurodegeneration. The gram-negative bacteria and gingipain
  can increase the release of inflammatory cytokines. Concerning neurodegeneration,
  gingipain, MG, and gram-negative bacteria can induce neuronal death. The gram-negative
  bacteria provoke neuronal loss through the activation of the neuronal TLR4 signaling
  pathway. Hcp1: Heme carrier protein; IL-6: Interleukin 6; IL-1β: Interleukin 1β;
  IL-18: Interleukin 18; MMP8: Matrix metalloproteinase-8; NLRP1: Nod-like receptor
  protein 1; RAGE: Receptor for advanced glycation end products; SCFA: Short-chain
  fatty acid; TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor α; VacA: Vacuolating cytotoxin A'
