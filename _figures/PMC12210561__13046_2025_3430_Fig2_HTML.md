caption: Gln modulates multiple signalling pathways to regulate cancer cell proliferation.
  In the event of Gln deficiency or Gln metabolism inhibition, it can activate YAP
  protein in the Hippo signaling pathway, and also inhibit cancer cell proliferation
  by inhibiting YAP entry into the nucleus and binding to TEAD. In addition, it has
  been demonstrated that YAP1 can promote ECM deposition by enhancing CTGF secretion
  and release, as well as ASCT2 expression, enhanced Gln hydrolysis, and activation
  of the mTOR1 signalling pathway to promote cancer cell proliferation. The AMPK-MTORC1
  signalling axis has been identified as a key regulator, and GLS and ASNS have been
  shown to compensate each other for their respective activities, which has been identified
  as a significant factor contributing to the low anticancer efficiency observed when
  GLS inhibitors are used in isolation
