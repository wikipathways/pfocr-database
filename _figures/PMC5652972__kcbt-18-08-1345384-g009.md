caption: 'A schematic diagram showing c-Myc phosphorylation and degradation in normal
  vs. cancer cells. (A) c-Myc degradation in normal cells. Step 1: In early G1 phase
  of the cell cycle, and in response to mitogenic stimulation, Ras is activated and
  phosphorylates Erk through the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Phosphorylation activates
  Erk, which then phosphorylates c-Myc on Ser62. Step 2: As the cell cycle progresses,
  during the late G1 phase Ras signaling decreases and does not activate PI3K, which
  in turn does not inhibit GSK3β. Step 3: Active GSK3β phosphorylates pSer62-c-Myc
  on Thr58. Step 4: The doubly phosphorylated c-Myc is a substrate for the enzyme
  PIN1, which causes a conformational change in c-Myc from its cis to trans form.
  Step 5: The trans form of c-Myc is a substrate for PP2A, which dephosphorylates
  pSer62 to give Thr58 phosphorylated c-Myc. Step 6: The singly phosphorylated pThr58-c-Myc
  is a substrate for the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7. Step 7: Ubiquitination of c-Myc targets
  the protein for degradation through the proteasome. (B) c-Myc degradation in cancer
  cells. Step 1: Ras is overexpressed, and phosphorylates PI3K simultaneously with
  Erk phosphorylation and activation (step 2), which causes inhibition of GSK3β by
  phosphorylated PI3K. As a result, inactive GSK3β fails to phosphorylate c-Myc on
  Thr58 (step 3), which prevents the rest of the c-Myc degradation pathway (steps
  4–7). Thus, c-Myc accumulates in cancer cells, enhancing cell growth. The schematic
  diagram is adapted from references 8, 11, and 13.'
