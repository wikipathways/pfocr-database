caption: The hypothetic molecular mechanisms and modes of the pharmacological action
  of adaptogen are updated from the authors’ free access publication [66] and authors’
  drawings. Effects of adaptogens on key mediators of neuroendocrine-immune complex,
  cardiovascular, and detoxifying systems that regulate adaptive stress response to
  stressors/pathogens in stress and aging-induced diseases and disorders. CRH- and
  ACTH-induced stimulation of GPCR receptors activates the cAMP-dependent protein
  kinase (PKA) signaling pathway in the regulation of energy balance and metabolism
  across multiple systems, including adipose tissue (lipolysis), liver (gluconeogenesis,
  glucose tolerance), pancreas, gut (insulin exocytosis and sensitivity), etc. The
  key molecules involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway are receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs). Activating the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway promotes cell proliferation and
  growth, stimulates cell cycle vascular remodeling and cell survival, and inhibits
  cell apoptosis in response to extracellular signals. The nonspecific antiviral action
  of ginseng is associated with the activation of innate immunity by upregulation
  of the expression of the pathogen’s pattern recognition receptors, specifically
  toll-like receptors and TLR-mediated signaling pathways. The protein kinase C (PKC)
  family of enzymes with isoforms plays an essential cell-type-specific role, particularly
  in the immune system, through phosphorylation of CARD-CC family proteins and subsequent
  NF-κB activation. Three stress-activated MAPK signaling pathways playing crucial
  roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death have been implicated
  in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
  disease, and cancer. (1) The stress factors inducing the activation of the c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)-mediated adaptive
  signaling pathway are heat shock, irradiation, reactive oxygen species, cytotoxic
  drugs, inflammatory cytokines, hormones, growth factors, and other stresses. Activating
  the JNK/MAPK10 signaling pathway promotes cell death and apoptosis via the upregulation
  of proapoptotic genes. (2) The activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) pathway is initiated by hormones and stresses to trigger endothelial
  cell proliferation during angiogenesis, T cell activation, long-term potentiation
  in hippocampal neurons, phosphorylation of the transcription factor p53, activation
  of phospholipase A2 in mast cells, followed by activation of biosynthesis leukotrienes
  and inflammation/allergy, etc. (3) The third major stress-activated p38 signaling
  pathway contributes to the control of inflammation, the release of cytokines by
  macrophages and neutrophils, apoptosis, cell differentiation, and cell cycle regulation.
