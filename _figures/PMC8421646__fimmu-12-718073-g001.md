caption: 'The main pathogenic mechanism of blister formation in patients with BP:
  Autoimmune abnormalities such as dysfunction of Th cells and Treg cells lead to
  the production of anti-BP180 autoantibodies, among which BP180IgG and IgE are the
  main pathogenic antibodies for blister formation. (1) Mechanical damage: Both BP180IgG
  and IgE could bind to the NC16A domain of BP180, resulting in BP180 internalization,
  thus decreasing the adhesion; (2) Inflammatory injury: BP180IgG and IgE could also
  activate keratinocytes to release IL-8 and other cytokines by binding to BP180.
  Moreover, BP180IgG and IgE also activate mast cells in a complement-dependent or
  independent way to release cytokines and mMCP-4. These above cytokines and mMCP-4
  recruit and activate inflammatory cells dominated by eosinophils and neutrophils
  to magnify the inflammatory response of skin lesions and cause tissue damage; (3)
  Specific pathways of mast cell activation: BP180IgG and IgE directly activate mast
  cells by binding to FcγR or FcϵR of mast cells. BP180IgG binding BP180 also activate
  the complement cascade pathway to produce C5a, which binds to the C5aR of mast cells
  and indirectly causes mast cell activation.'
