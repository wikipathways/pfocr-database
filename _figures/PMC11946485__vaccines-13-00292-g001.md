caption: PI3K signaling pathway inhibition and antitumor immune synergistic therapy
  strategy. Inhibiting the PI3K signaling pathway can enhance antitumor immune response
  through dual regulation of immune activation and immune suppression, on the one
  hand activating effector immune mechanisms, and on the other hand inhibiting the
  function of immune-suppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs). On this basis, tumor vaccines using tumor-associated antigens
  (TAAs) or tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) can enhance immune response function, while
  immune checkpoint inhibitors further alleviate immune suppression by blocking inhibitory
  signals. The synergistic application of three types of therapies significantly improves
  the targeted clearance efficiency of cancer cells, providing multidimensional strategic
  support for antitumor immunotherapy
