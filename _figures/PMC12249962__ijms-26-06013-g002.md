caption: 'Overview of key metabolic pathways, transcriptomic modulation, and chemotherapeutic
  and metabolic compounds for prostate cancer treatment. This figure summarizes treatments
  discussed throughout this review and illustrates the interplay between metabolic
  reprogramming and major regulatory signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells,
  highlighting potential therapeutic targets. Key metabolic substrates include glucose,
  glutamine, fatty acids, lactate, pyruvate, cholesterol, triacylglycerol (TAG), steroids,
  and citrate. The main metabolic pathways represented are glycolysis, glutaminolysis,
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) or Krebs cycle, electron transport chain and oxidative
  phosphorylation (ETC-OXPHOS), the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (oxPPP), and lipid metabolism. Relevant metabolic enzymes and transporters are shown,
  including glucose transporters (GLUT1/4), zinc transporters (ZIP1/3), and sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), along with their roles in regulating
  nutrient flux and metabolite availability. The generation of key metabolic intermediates—such
  as acetyl-CoA, NADPH, and reduced glutathione (GSH)—is also indicated. Red arrows
  illustrate the convergence between gene regulatory networks and metabolic pathways.
  Color-coded compounds represent different therapeutic strategies: blue indicates
  classical single-target metabolic agents; purple denotes combinatorial treatments;
  and yellow highlights compounds with demonstrated transcriptomic modulation (TF).
  Dashed lines in each color reflect the principal molecular mechanisms affected by
  the corresponding treatment'
