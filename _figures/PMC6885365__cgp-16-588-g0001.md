caption: . Analysis of protein–protein interaction (PPI) by online bioinformatics.
  (A) PPI of DEPs analyzed against the STRING Database for association networks. Known
  interactions are edges of pink (experimentally determined) and deep sky blue (database
  obtained). Predicted interactions are edges of green (gene neighborhood), blue (gene
  co-occurrence), and red (gene fusions). Edges of yellowish green are text-mining.
  Edges of black color mean co-expression. Edges of light purple mean protein homology.
  (B-C) Physical interaction and involvement of DEPs in the KRAS pathway (B) or EGF
  and EGFR (C), as analyzed by GeneMANIA.
