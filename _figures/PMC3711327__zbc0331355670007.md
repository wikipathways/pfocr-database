caption: A model for the regulation of transcriptional induction of ICL1 and FBP1
  by the PIPTC. A schematic model for the PIPTC-mediated regulation of chromatin architecture
  at the ICL1/FBP1 promoter is presented. ICL1 and FBP1 contain a positive (CSRE)
  and a negative (URE) transcriptional regulatory element at their promoters. The
  CSRE binds to Cat8 or Sip4 transcriptional activators. The URE binds to the Mig1/2
  transcriptional repressor. FBP1 and ICL1 belong to TATA box-containing genes that
  have the +1 nucleosome positioned at the TSS and depend on SAGA rather than transcription
  factor IID to establish the PIC. In glucose-rich medium, glycolysis is actively
  functional (ON) (left). Gluconeogenesis is inactive (OFF), and transcription of
  ICL1 and FBP1 is repressed by the Mig1/2-Cyc8-Tup1 complex. Transcription of CAT8
  and SIP4 is repressed in glucose-rich medium, and therefore transcriptional activation
  function from the CSRE at the ICL1/FBP1 promoter is tenuous. In non-glucose carbon
  medium, in which glycolysis is no longer functional (OFF), gluconeogenesis is activated
  (ON) (right). The Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor is converted to the Cti6-Cyc8-Tup1 coactivator
  by the PIPTC at the late endosomal/vacuolar membrane. The PIPTC appears to play
  a critical role in remodulating the chromatin architecture at the ICL1 and FBP1
  promoters to a promoter structure more accessible to the Cat8 and Sip4 activators.
  The Cti6-Cyc8-Tup1 coactivator and the Cat8/Sip4 activators recruit the SAGA coactivator
  complex to the ICL1 and FBP1 promoters, presumably through the interaction between
  Tra1 of the SAGA complex and Cti6 or Cat8/Sip4 proteins. Inferring from the characterized
  features at the GAL1 promoter, we predict that SAGA may recruit the Swi/Snf nucleosome
  remodeler that evicts the +1 nucleosome positioning at the TSS and opens the promoter
  to establish the PIC. Both the PIPTC and the Cat8/Sip4-dependent activation pathway
  play critical roles in robustly establishing the activated state (right) from the
  repressed state (left) of chromatin architecture at the ICL1 and FBP1 promoters.
  PI(3)P, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.
