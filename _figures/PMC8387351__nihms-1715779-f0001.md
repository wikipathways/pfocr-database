caption: 'Three different stress pathways triggered by misfolded protein in neuronal
  and glial cells are illustrated – the heat shock response (HSR), the unfolded protein
  response (UPR), and the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Therapeutic modulators
  of TBI are shown in red, indicating the pathways they affect. UPR: Misfolded proteins
  in the ER bind the stress-sensing chaperone, BiP, sequestering it away from PERK,
  IRE-1 and ATF-6 and activating them. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α leading to global
  repression of translation and increasing selective translation of ATF-4. IRE-1 triggers
  the unconventional cytoplasmic splicing of XBP-1, as well as activation of the JNK
  pathway. ATF-6 translocates to the Golgi apparatus and is processed to form the
  active transcription factor ATF-6s. Together, these mediators dictate the induction
  of pathways that attempt to restore normal cellular function by refolding or degrading
  misfolded proteins, and in the event of prolonged stress, activating apoptotic pathways.
  UPS: Misfolded proteins are tagged with a polyubiquitin chain and targeted to the
  cytoplasmic or nuclear proteasome for degradation. HSR: HSPs bind HSF and sequester
  it in an inactive monomeric form. During cellular stress, HSPs bind misfolded proteins,
  allowing HSF to trimerize, translocate to the nucleus and trigger the transcription
  of more HSPs. Abbreviations: BiP, Ig binding protein; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase;
  IRE-1, inositol requiring enzyme-1; ATF, activating transcription factor; eIF2α,
  eukaryotic initiation factor 2α; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; XBP-1, X-box binding
  protein-1; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, ER associated degradation; JNK, Jun
