caption: 'Effect of UA on carbohydrate and purine metabolism in liver. UA activates
  fructokinase (enzyme 1), increasing the formation of fructose-1-phosphate (F1P),
  which activates glucokinase (enzyme 2), by disrupting its interaction with glucokinase
  regulatory protein, contributing to the increase in the glycolytic flux. UA also
  activates aldose reductase (enzyme 3), enabling endogenous fructose for-mation through
  the polyol pathway. Fructose, through up-regulation of transketolase, favors the
  non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway, for the synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate
  (Rib-5-P), essential for the formation of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP),
  a precursor of IMP, through the purine de novo synthesis pathway. The purine de
  novo pathway is also acceler-ated by depletion of adenine nucleotides, caused by
  a load of fructose (see ), which promotes a release in feedback inhibition of PRPP
  synthetase (enzyme 4) and amidophosphoribosyltransferase (enzyme 5). Rib-1-P generated
  during degradation of purine nucleotides by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (enzyme
  6) is converted by phosphoribomutase (enzyme 7) to Rib-5-P, contributing to the
  acceleration of the purine de novo synthesis. G6P: glucose-6-phosphate; Ino: inosine;
  Hyp: hypoxanthine; Rib-1-P: ribose-1-phosphate; Xan: xanthine; PRA: phosphoribosylamine,
  : activation; : increase.'
