caption: 'Reaction scheme for modelling gene expression of a polycistronic operon.
  We constructed a model of a four-gene operon and a linear metabolic pathway, containing
  5 metabolites and 4 enzymes encoded by the operonic genes. Operon expression was
  modelled following the “read-through” operon model of Swain . Transcription is modelled
  as reversible binding of RNAP to promoter (D) with rates: f 0 (association) and
  b 0 (dissociation). Isomerization from closed to open complex and initiation of
  transcription are approximated as a first-order process (with rate k 0). Only the
  leader region of the mRNA, M, is tracked in the model, which is made by transcribing
  polymerase, T, at rate v 0. mRNA molecules are degraded with rate mf 0, and diluted
  with rate D. Ribosomes compete with degradosomes for leader mRNA and bind reversibly
  (rates mf 1 for association and mb 1 for dissociation). Translation is started from
  the mC 2 state with rate k 1, which then frees M for further ribosome or degradasome
  binding. Enzymes are translated in the mT state with rate v 1, and decay and dilute
  with rate α (α = D+kdegr). In case of a “read-through” operon, only the first cistron
  has a ribosome binding site; thus, a translating ribosome, mT 2, releases enzyme
  E 1 before translating the next protein (in the state mT 3). The translation rate
  parameter was fine tuned to achieve realistic time delays between the appearances
  of consecutive gene products (approximately 60 s, on average). See  for parameter
  values and constants.'
