caption: Autophagy mediates macrophage reprogramming of the tumour immune microenvironment
  hypoxia and ROS in TME initiate macrophage autophagy, increase extracellular ATP
  concentration, promote NK cell and macrophage infiltration and reduce IFN‐1 secretion
  and T‐cell infiltration. At the same time, the phagocytosis of macrophages was reduced
  by CD47/SIRPα. DAMPs, CCL2 and IL‐6 can also trigger macrophage NF‐κB to mediate
  autophagy, chemotactic macrophage differentiation to M2 phenotype and reduce the
  release of inflammatory factors. Notably, autophagy‐secreted TRAPs also can chemotactic
  the M2 phenotype of macrophages. In addition, the enhancement of macrophage autophagy
  can effectively block the accumulation of DAMPs in mitochondria and avoid starting
  the focal death pathway to secrete pro‐inflammatory factors such as IL‐1β and IL‐18.
  The clearance of apoptotic cells by TIM4 will trigger autophagy mediated by LCA
  pathway in macrophages to promote the secretion of anti‐inflammatory factors and
  inhibit the secretion of pro‐inflammatory factors. To sum up, the effect of autophagy
  secretion of tumour cells on macrophages and autophagy of macrophages themselves
  will promote the polarization of macrophages into M2 phenotype and promote tumour
  metastasis and angiogenesis
