caption: Network analysis of proteins found to be significantly altered in abundance
  in the CSF proteome by ANOVA (p value <0.05) following analysis of individual subject
  samples. Network analysis was performed employing ingenuity pathway tools (www.ingenuity.com)
  on proteins that were annotated in the Ingenuity database (101 of the 108 proteins).
  Illustrated are proteins, colored by ratio (Lyme/Control) of average protein abundances,
  with known functional and disease associated relationships that differed in abundance
  levels in the CSF.
