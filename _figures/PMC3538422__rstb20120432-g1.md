caption: 'The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway relevant to flower colour. The pathways
  leading to anthocyanidin 3-glucosides are conserved in seed plants. Anthocyanidin
  3-glucosides are further modified by glycosylation, acylation and methylation in
  a species-specific manner. P450 enzymes are underlined. In this review, anthocyanins
  based on peonidin are included as cyanidin-based anthocyanins whilst those based
  on petunidin and malvidin are included as delphinidin-based anthocyanins. Abbreviations
