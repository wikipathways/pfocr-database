caption: Inside-out signaling recruits Talin-1 and Kindlin-3 to β2 integrin. Upon
  stimulation of neutrophils with chemokines, both Talin-1 and Kindlin-3 become rapidly
  recruited to activate β2 integrins. This can be divided into two pathways for Talin-1
  and Kindlin-3. For Talin-1 recruitment (A), GPCRs engage with their ligands which
  causes the heterotrimeric G-proteins to split into Gα and Gβγ. This initiates the
  activation of PLC by Gα i, and Gβγ. Signaling through the second messengers’ calcium
  which is released from the endoplasmic reticulum by IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG)
  is a critical element in many biological systems. Integration of calcium and DAG
  signals has been suggested to occur primarily through protein kinase C (PKC) family
  members, which bind both calcium and DAG. An alternative pathway involves CalDAG-GEF1,
  which has structural features (calcium-binding EF hands and DAG-binding C1 domains)
  and functions in calcium and DAG signal integration. This GEF activates RAP1, which
  then results into activation of RIAM and binding of RIAM to Talin-1. Together with
  catalyzation of PIP into PI(4,5)P2 by PIP5Kγ90 through the PKC-PLD-Arf6 axis, these
  events recruit Talin-1 to β2 integrin, thus extending the integrin from the bent
  conformation. Gβγ is also involved in Kindlin-3 recruitment (B). In addition to
  activating PLC, Gβγ also activates PI3K, which generates PI(3,4,5)P3. This allows
  recruitment of Kindlin-3 to β2 integrin. Binding of Kindlin-3 after Talin-1 binding
  activates extended β2 integrins. Note that the Kindlin-3 recruitment cascade might
  not be complete.

  description: Inside-out signaling recruits Talin-1 and Kindlin-3 to β2 integrin.
    Upon stimulation of neutrophils with chemokines, both Talin-1 and Kindlin-3 become
    rapidly recruited to activate β2 integrins. This can be divided into two pathways
    for Talin-1 and Kindlin-3. For Talin-1 recruitment (A), GPCRs engage with their

    initiates the activation of PLC by Gα i, and Gβγ. Signaling through the second

    diacylglycerol (DAG) is a critical element in many biological systems. Integration
    of calcium and DAG signals has been suggested to occur primarily through protein
    kinase C (PKC) family members, which bind both calcium and DAG. An alternative
    pathway involves CalDAG-GEF1, which has structural features (calcium-binding EF

    This GEF activates RAP1, which then results into activation of RIAM and binding
