caption: Hypothesis schema depicting the mechanism of endotoxin-tolerant re-programming
  mediated by EPO in macrophages. EPO is induced by initial LPS exposure through upregulation
  of HIF-1α. Binding of EPO to its receptor EPOR expressed on macrophages leads to
  activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, which further upregulated expressions of Irak3 (a
  negative regulator of LPS response) and Wdr5 (a core scaffolding component of histone
  methyltransferase complexes). When tolerized macrophages were challenged with a
  secondary dose of LPS, expression of proinflammatory genes such as Il1b, Il6, and
  Tnfa was robustly suppressed by IRAK3 via negative regulation of NF-κB, whereas
  the expression of host protective genes including Cnlp, Marco, and Vegfc in macrophages
  was upregulated by WDR5-induced histone methylation. In addition, SAL promotes re-programming
  of endotoxin-tolerant macrophages by inducing endogenous EPO through upregulation
  of Hif1a.
