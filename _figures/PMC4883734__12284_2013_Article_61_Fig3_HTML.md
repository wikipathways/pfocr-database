caption: Schematic diagram of a plant cell showing regulation of ion homeostasis by
  various ion transporters. The salinity stress signal is perceived by receptor(s)
  or salt sensor(s) probably present at the plasma membrane of the cell. The signal
  is responsible for activating the SOS pathway, the component of which helps in regulating
  some of these transporters. The transporters are K+ inward-rectifying channel (OsAKT1),
  K+/Na+ symporter (OsHKT1), nonselective cation channel (NCC), K+ outward-rectifying
  channel (OsKCO1), Na+/H+ antiporters (OsSOS1), vacuolar Na+/H+ exchangers (OsNHX1-4),
  endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger (OsNHX5), H+/Ca+ antiporter (OsCAX1) and vacuolar chloride
  channel (OsCLC1). Na+ extrusion from plant cells is powered by the electrochemical
  gradient generated by H+-ATPases, which permits the Na+/H+ antiporters to couple
  the passive movement of H+ inside along the electrochemical gradient and extrusion
  of Na+ out of cytosol. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN/EE, trans-Golgi network/early
  endosome; LE/PVC/MVB, late endosome/pre-vacuolar compartment/multivesicular body;
  RE, recycling endosome. The stress signal sensed by SOS3 activates SOS2, which activates
  SOS1, details is given in the text.
