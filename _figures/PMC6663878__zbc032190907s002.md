caption: 'Basic metabolic pathway for production of alkanes and the refined metabolic
  pathway with auxiliary systems to enhance alkane production from exogenous LCFA
  used in this report. Enzymes and proteins associated with alkane production, formic
  acid elimination, and ROS detoxification are shown in green, blue, and red, respectively.
  Auxiliary systems added include formate dehydrogenase to eliminate the formic acid
  by-product in the main pathway and an ROS-detoxifying system to eliminate H2O2 in
  the side pathway. Abbreviation used are: CoA, coenzyme A; Fdred, reduced ferredoxin;
  Fdox, oxidized ferredoxin; XaFDH, Xanthobacter formate dehydrogenase; TrxAox, oxidized
  thioredoxin; TrxAred, reduced thioredoxin; Prx, peroxiredoxin; TrxB, thioredoxin
  reductase.'
papertitle: Addition of formate dehydrogenase increases the production of renewable
  alkane from an engineered metabolic pathway.
