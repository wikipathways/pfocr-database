caption: Diagram of the main molecular interactions implemented in the model. The
  diagram illustrates surface molecules and their interactions (on the left), as well
  as the intracellular downstream signaling to ERK (extracellular-regulated kinase)
  and Akt (on the right). Surface Met can bind hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and
  get activated in the absence of α5β1 integrin that leads to rapid internalization
  and degradation, whereas integrin-bound Met has lower internalization/degradation
  and higher recycling rates. In addition to integrin-binding peptide (AXT050) that
  dissociates the Met/α5β1 complex, effect of anti-Met (cabozantinib), anti-HGF (rilotumumab),
  and Raf inhibitor (sorafenib) drugs were explored in this study
