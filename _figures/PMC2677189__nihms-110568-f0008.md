caption: Schematic of a novel pathway for heme oxygenase/carbon monoxide-dependent
  cyclic GMP signaling based on the newly described sGC/cyclic GMP-modulating agents
  YC-1 and BAY 41-2272 as shown. Also shown are characterized (*) and potential (#)
  sites of action of these agents that serve to enhance sGC function and stimulate
  cyclic GMP signaling. Through such pharmacologic modulation, downstream cyclic GMP-specific
  events are controlled including cellular proliferation and apoptosis and matrix
  balance via MMP biology. Through inhibition of cell proliferation and gelatinolytic
  MMP biology and exaggeration of cellular apoptosis, abnormal vessel growth is minimized
  and vascular protection conferred during states of injury or disease.
