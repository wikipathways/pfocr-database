caption: 'Hypothesis illustrated. Upper panel (A) Scheme of the SARS-CoV-2 journey
  towards to the brain: 1.-Infected lungs. 2.- The pulmonary mucus clearance system.
  3.- Enteroinvasion. 4.- An increased intestinal permeability allows the virus to
  access the bloodstream and spread. 5.- Haematogenous route. 6.- Neuroinvasion. Lower
  panel (B) SARS-CoV-2 virus reaches the intestine protected by the mucus from infected
  lungs. The virus can bind and activate the TLR4, which via MyD-88 could activate
  both zonulin and proinflammatory cytokines expression. Zonulin, secreted to the
  lumen, binds with PAR2 inducing disassembling of TJ. Now, the virus can use the
  paracellular pathway to access the circulatory system and reach the brain. Zonulin
  can also access to the bloodstream. Then, the virus, via brain zonulin receptor,
  can induce expression of zonulin and consequently increase permeability of the BBB
  by inducing disassembling of TJ. This causes neuroinvasion of the virus. TLR4, toll-like
  receptor 4; MyD-88, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; PAR2, protease-activated
  receptor 2; TJ, tight junctions; IEB, intestinal epithelial barrier; BBB, blood-brain
  barrier. Created with BioRender.com.'
