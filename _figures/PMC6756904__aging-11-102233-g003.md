caption: Significant modular analysis and function enrichment analysis based on PPI
  network. (A) PPI network was constructed using a total of 77 commonly up-regulated
  DEGs. MCODE, plug-in of Cytoscape, was used to detect most significant co-regulated
  modular. The most significant modular including AGPAT9, AQP7, HMGCS2, KLF15, MLXIPL
  and PPARGC1A, was marked in yellow. (B) functional annotations indicated that 77
  DEGs were mostly involved in carbohydrate digestion and absorption, fatty acid transmembrane
  transport activity, PPAP signaling pathway, response to methionine, insulin resistance,
  water channel activity, enamel mineralization, negative regulation of mitochondrial
  fission, etc.
