caption: Schematic and simplified overview of the intracellular transduction cascades
  induced by 5-HT2AR TrkB and Sig-1R receptor activation by psychedelics. It is essential
  to emphasize that our understanding of the activation or inhibition of specific
  pathways and the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for triggering plasticity
  in specific neuron types remains incomplete. This figure illustrates the mechanisms
  associated with heightened plasticity within these pathways. Psychedelics (such
  as LSD, psilocin, and mescaline) bind to TrkB dimers, stabilizing their conformation.
  Furthermore, they enhance the localization of TrkB dimers within lipid rafts, thereby
  extending their signaling via PLCγ1. The BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway (black arrows)
  initiates with BDNF activating TrkB, prompting autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues
  within TrkB’s intracellular C-terminal domain (specifically Tyr490 and Tyr515),
  followed by the recruitment of SHC. This, in turn, leads to the binding of GRB2,
  which subsequently associates with SOS and GTPase RAS to form a complex, thereby
  initiating the ERK cascade. This cascade ultimately results in the activation of
  the CREB transcription factor. CREB, in turn, mediates the transcription of genes
  essential for neuronal survival, differentiation, BDNF production, neurogenesis,
  neuroprotection, neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and myelination. Activation
  of Tyr515 in TrkB also activates the PI3K signaling pathway through GAB1 and the
  SHC/GRB2/SOS complex, subsequently leading to the activation of protein kinase AKT
  and CREB. Both Akt and ERK activate mTOR, which is associated with downstream processes
  involving dendritic growth, AMPAR expression, and overall neuronal survival. Additionally,
  the phosphorylation of TrkB’s Tyr816 residue activates the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)
  pathway, generating IP3 and DAG. IP3 activates its receptor (IP3R) in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), causing the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the ER and activating
  Ca2+/CaM/CaMKII which in turn activates CREB. DAG activates PKC, leading to ERK
  activation and synaptic plasticity. After being released into the extracellular
  space, glutamate binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors, including NMDA receptors
  (NMDARs) and AMPA receptors (AMPARs), as well as metabotropic glutamate receptors
  (mGluR1 to mGluR8), located on the membranes of both postsynaptic and presynaptic
  neurons. Upon binding, these receptors initiate various responses, such as membrane
  depolarization, activation of intracellular messenger cascades, modulation of local
  protein synthesis, and ultimately, gene expression. The surface expression and function
  of NMDARs and AMPARs are dynamically regulated through processes involving protein
  synthesis, degradation, and receptor trafficking between the postsynaptic membrane
  and endosomes. This insertion and removal of postsynaptic receptors provides a mechanism
  for the long-term modulation of synaptic strength [122]. Psychedelic compounds exhibit
  a high affinity for 5-HT2R, leading to the activation of G-protein and β-arrestin
  signaling pathways (red arrows). Downstream for 5-HT2R activation, these pathways
  intersect with both PI3K/Akt and ERK kinases, similar to the BDNF/TrkB signaling
  pathway. This activation results in enhanced neural plasticity. A theoretical model
  illustrating the signaling pathway of DMT through Sig-1R at MAMs suggests that,
  at endogenous affinity concentrations (14 μM), DMT binds to Sig-1R, triggering the
  dissociation of Sig-1R from BiP. This enables Sig-1R to function as a molecular
  chaperone for IP3R, resulting in an increased flow of Ca2+ from the ER into the
  mitochondria. This, in turn, activates the TCA cycle and enhances the production
  of ATP. However, at higher concentrations (100 μM), DMT induces the translocation
  of Sig-1Rs from the MAM to the plasma membrane (dashed inhibitory lines), leading
  to the inhibition of ion channels. BDNF = brain-derived neurotrophic factor; TrkB
