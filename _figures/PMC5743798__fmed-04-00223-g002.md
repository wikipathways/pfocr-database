caption: Pathological impact of the interference of gaseous messengers NO and CO with
  mitochondria in critical care diseases (CCD). The schema illustrates the possible
  interactions between the gaseous mediators NO and CO with mitochondria in conjunction
  with CCD associated factors that exert a strong interfering potential. Intracellular
  concentrations of NO and CO are determined by the underlying enzyme activity of
  NOS and HO and by diffusion from or to extracellular stores. NO and CO mediate intracellular
  signaling pathways (1 and 2), such as activation of guanylate cyclase, ion channels,
  and activation of gene signatures, etc. Both messengers are able to inhibit mitochondrial
  respiration (3), mainly by competing with O2 for binding to cytochrome c oxidase
  (COX). NO in conjunction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) is able to from peroxynitrite
  (ONOO) (4), with the capacity to damage biomolecules. Free ferrous ion is able to
  induce lipid peroxidation (LPO) via the Fenton reaction (5) in presence of ROS.
  By the formation of nitrosyl species, NO may prevent iron-mediated oxidative damage.
  Scarcity of O2 resulting from tissue hypoxia (↓O2), decelerates all oxygen-dependent
  reactions (6), and leads to a decreased formation of ATP. In hypoxia also the intracellular
  production of NO and CO is diminished, and the intracellular levels of NO and CO
  are supposed to decrease as well. However, the high consumption of oxygen will overrule
  this effect and presumably shift the balance towards NO- and CO-mediated inhibition
  of mitochondrial respiration. Intracellular ROS may originate from dysfunctional
  mitochondria, especially in presence of increased levels of NO, or from non-mitochondrial
  sources, and exert pro-oxidative damaging effects (7). These effects may be limited
  by the HO reaction products CO and biliverdin/bilirubin. Acidosis (↓pH) (8), which
  may occur secondary to tissue hypoxia, favors the formation of nitric acid from
  NO oxidation products, such as nitrite or nitrate, allowing diffusion across membranes.
  Additionally, a decreased pH affects the affinity constants of biatomic gases to
  the heme moiety to different degree. For hemoglobin, which is considered as a sink
  for CO, a decreased CO affinity will result in increased levels intracellular CO
  and an increased potential to inhibit mitochondrial respiration. The table attempts
  to quantify the effects of CCD-associated factors, such as tissue hypoxia, increased
  generation of ROS (↑ROS), and tissue acidosis on the interactions between the gaseous
  mediators NO and CO with mitochondria. Superscripted numbers refer to the interaction
  or pathway shown in the scheme. The number of arrows represents the presumed amplitude
  of the indicated effect. NO and CO influence on intracellular signaling, mitochondrial
  respiration, the generation and the effects of oxidative stressors, such as ONOO
  and ROS, involving the Fenton reaction, to different degree.
