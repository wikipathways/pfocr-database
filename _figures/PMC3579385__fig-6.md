caption: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. The MAPK pathway
  consists of sequential MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK),
  and MAPK activations. Extracellular stimuli and stress, such as growth factors,
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, are detected by
  MAPKKK. The subsequent activation of MAPKK and MAPK regulates downstream targets
  to control diverse cellular activities, including stress response, apoptosis, cell-cycle
  arrest, cell survival, innate immunity, proliferation, and differentiation.
