caption: Pathophysiology of and immunotherapeutic agents for psoriasis. External environmental
  stress and trauma is a possible trigger of psoriasis, especially in individuals
  with genetic susceptibilities (e.g., PSORS1). This leads to the release of CCL20,
  CXCL8, and CXCL1, stimulating CCR6+IL-17+ lymphocytes, neutrophils, and IL-23+CD14+
  DCs, respectively. Release of IL-17A and IL-17F via IL-17-producing cells (Th17,
  Tc17, and ILC3) results in the activation of the IL-17RA/IL-17RC complex in keratinocytes,
  further feeding the inflammatory response. Production of IL-22 by ILC3 accelerates
  hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. DCs induce cytokines like IL-1β, TNF-α, and
  IL-23. IL-17-producing cells are stimulated by IL-23 through the JAK2/TYK2-STAT3
  pathway. Ustekinumab targets the p40 subunit shared by IL-12 and IL-23, and guselkumab
  and risankizumab inhibit the p19 subunit of IL-23. Secukinumab and ixekizumab are
  inhibitors of IL-17A. Bimekizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-17A and
  IL-17F. Brodalumab is an inhibitor of IL-17RA. With respect to JAK signaling, deucravacitinib
  acts to inhibit TYK2, and brepocitinib inhibits TYK2 and JAK1 simultaneously.
