caption: 'Anti-apoptotic pathway of pterostilbene: PTS mediates its cytoprotective
  effect mainly through the activation of Nrf-2, which in turn protects the mitochondrial
  functioning, thereby causing a reduction in the induction of pro-apoptotic factors
  such as cytochrome C, BAX, and caspase-3. In vascular endothelial cells, PTS protects
  against the initiation of apoptotic signaling by countering the effect of oxLDL
  in activating its receptor lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LOX-1),
  thereby preventing the accumulation of P53 as well as the activation of NFκB. Moreover,
  PTS increases the intracellular calcium levels and promotes the cytoprotective autophagy
  of the cell, consequently preventing the deleterious effect of apoptosis.'
