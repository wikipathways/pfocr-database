caption: 'Inflammasome regulatory network. The depicted genes carried variants with
  MAF and CADD scores falling within the outer dotted region in Fig. ; panel-C. Genes
  carrying the selected variants (inner dotted region in Fig. ; panel-C) are bolded
  in red. Numbers next to the gene names represent the number of MS enriched variants.
  Black, green and red arrows represent general pathways and stimulatory/inhibitory
  effects, respectively. Genes stacked together or connected with black lines form
  complexes or have confirmed protein-protein interactions (in the majority of cases
  via the CARD protein domain). Genes written with red have already been associated
  with MS. The genes are organized in five groups: Interferon response, RNA polymerase
  3 and rig-like receptors (RLRs), main inflammasome genes, other genes (regulating
  inflammasome activity by sequestration or phosphorylation), and the NOD2/RIPK2 complex
  integrating the latter three and inducing the autophagy pathway. EBV – Epstein-Barr
  virus, PAMP/DAMP – Pathogen/Damage-associated molecular patterns, ROS – Reactive
  oxygen species, HERV – Human endogenous retroviruses, ISGs – Interferon-stimulated
  genes, IFNAR – Interferon receptor.'
