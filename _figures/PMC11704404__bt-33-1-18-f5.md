caption: 'Schematic diagram of the fibrotic pathway via TGF-β and Smad-dependent signaling,
  and the effect of AMPK on the pathway. TGF-β signaling is initiated when members
  of the TGF-β subfamily, such as TGF-β and BMPs, bind to TβRII, leading to the subsequent
  phosphorylation of TβRI. R-Smads (Smad1/2/3/5/8), phosphorylated by p-TβRII, form
  a complex with Co-Smad. This complex increases the expression of fibrotic factors
  in the nucleus with the transcriptional coactivator p300. I-Smads regulate the fibrotic
  response in two ways: by competing with R-Smads to inhibit complex formation with
  Smad4, and by promoting TβR1 degradation through Smurf1 in a negative feedback loop.
  AMPK inhibits the TGF-β pathway through various mechanisms, such as inhibiting R-Smad
  phosphorylation, suppressing p300 activity, and upregulating Smad7 expression, which
  leads to increase in TβR1 degradation. Although Smad6 also contributes to TβR1 degradation,
  studies on the effect of AMPK on Smad6 are lacking. Transforming Growth Factor Beta,
