caption: In the classic or genomic pathway, androgens can move in the cytoplasm, where
  they bind to the AR. This induces a conformational change in AR, releasing it from
  heat shock proteins. AR then translocates to the nucleus, where it dimerizes, interacts
  with cofactors (activators or repressors of transcription), and binds to androgen
  response elements, where it regulates expression of target genes. Nongenomic androgen
  actions are regulated over a membrane-bound AR or other receptors, which then transduce
  the signal into the cytoplasm, interacting directly with other membrane bound factors
  such as PI3K or activating other pathways, which lead to changes in second messengers,
  cytoplasmic calcium concentration, actin skeleton changes, and eventually also to
  the activation of other nuclear receptors and transcription factors. AKT, serine/threonine-protein
  kinase; AR, androgen receptor; ARE, androgen response element; Co, cofactors of
  AR, either activators or repressors of transcription; HSP, heat shock protein; mAR,
