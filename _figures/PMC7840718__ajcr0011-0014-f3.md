caption: The Wnt growth factor triggers macropinocytosis by binding to co-receptors
  Frizzled (Fz) and LDL receptor-related protein 6 (Lrp6) on the cell surface. The
  stabilized upstream effector, β-catenin, can translocate into the nucleus and bind
  with TCF transcriptional factors to promote the expression of the downstream effector,
  Wnt3a, which can increase the uptake of extracellular proteins. The stabilization
  of β-catenin benefits from the functional incapacitation of the complex components,
  APC, Axin1, GSK3β, and CK1, that could destruct β-catenin. The vacuolar protein
  sorting 4 (Vps4) contributes to β-catenin accumulation in cancer cells. In addition,
  Wnt-driven macropinocytosis may require the protein arginine methyltransferase 1
  (PRMT1) and Pak1 in cancer cells. However, the upstream effectors of PRMT1 and Pak1
  in Wnt signaling pathway, are still unclear.
