caption: Insulin-mediated feedback loops following PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Following
  treatment with PI3K inhibitors, the liver breaks down stored glycogen releasing
  glucose into the bloodstream. The increased levels of glucose (hyperglycaemia) are
  detected by the pancreas, and in an effort to overcome these high levels of glucose,
  large amounts of insulin are released (hyperinsulinemia). This substantial release
  of insulin is sufficient to partially reactivate the insulin receptor which re-instates
  both IRS and GBR2 activity. What results is an increase in both PI3K and MAPK pathway
  activation, limiting the therapeutic effects of PI3K inhibitors. mTOR1 inhibitors,
  such as rapamycin, block downstream translation by downregulating S6K1 and 4E-BP1.
  In turn, this de-represses the S6K1 substrate IRS1, which acts as an intermediary
  between insulin receptor and the PI3K complex. The recruitment of PI3K to the active
  receptor enhances both MAPK and downstream PI3K signalling. Thus, limiting the overall
  sensitivity of mTOR inhibition in these tumours. Downregulation of mTOR activity
  either through AKT inhibition or direct mTOR inhibition blocks 4E-BP1-mediated translation
  of PTEN. This enhances the pool of PIP3 in cells resulting in the sustained activation
  of AKT.

  description: Insulin-mediated feedback loops following PI3K/mTOR inhibition. Following
    treatment with PI3K inhibitors, the liver breaks down stored glycogen releasing
    glucose into the bloodstream. The increased levels of glucose (hyperglycaemia)
    are detected by the pancreas, and in an effort to overcome these high levels of
    glucose, large amounts of insulin are released (hyperinsulinemia). This substantial
    release of insulin is sufficient to partially reactivate the insulin receptor
    which re-instates both IRS and GBR2 activity. What results is an increase in both
    PI3K and MAPK pathway activation, limiting the therapeutic effects of PI3K inhibitors.
    mTOR1 inhibitors, such as rapamycin, block downstream translation by downregulating
    S6K1 and 4E-BP1. In turn, this de-represses the S6K1 substrate IRS1, which acts
    as an intermediary between insulin receptor and the PI3K complex. The recruitment
    of PI3K to the active receptor enhances both MAPK and downstream PI3K signalling.
    Thus, limiting the overall sensitivity of mTOR inhibition in these tumours. Downregulation
    of mTOR activity either through AKT inhibition or direct mTOR inhibition blocks
    4E-BP1-mediated translation of PTEN. This enhances the pool of PIP3 in cells resulting
    in the sustained activation of AKT.
