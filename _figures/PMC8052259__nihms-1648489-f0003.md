caption: 1) LPS treatment of murine DCs induces signaling through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway
  to activate the transcription factor NF-κB, which drives transcription of its target
  genes and DC maturation [, ]. m6A regulates DC maturation by promoting the translation
  of Tirap, which encodes an important adaptor protein for TLR4/MyD88 interaction
  []. m6A may also regulate MyD88 splicing []. 2) After activation, mature DCs can
  present antigens to T cells to influence their differentiation. This process involves
  MHC presentation of antigen peptides and interaction with T cell receptors (TCR),
  as well the interaction of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40 and CD80 []. m6A
  contributes to this process by promoting the translation of CD40 and CD80 mRNAs
  []. 3) T cells can also be activated by cytokines like IL-7. IL-7 signals through
  its receptor composed of IL-7Rα and the common gamma chain (γC), activating JAK1
  and JAK3, which induce the activation and homodimerization of STAT5, inducing cytokines
  like IFN-γ and genes involved in T cell survival and differentiation []. Additionally,
  this pathway induces suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, such as SOCS1
  and SOCS3, as well as Cish, all of which repress activation of the IL-7 pathway.
  The mRNA of Socs1, Socs3, and Cish are m6A-modified, and m6A destabilizes their
  transcripts, thus promoting the IL-7 pathway and T cell survival and differentiation
  []. Molecules whose expression are known to be regulated by m6A or m6A-related enzymes
  are shown in red text.
