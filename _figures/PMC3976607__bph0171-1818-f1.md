caption: Overview of the induction of PGC1-α-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis by
  resveratrol, bezafibrate and AICAR. During caloric excess PGC-1α, the master regulator
  of mitochondrial biogenesis is in an inactive acetylated (ac) state. In times of
  caloric restriction, or after exercise, energy becomes scarce resulting in increases
  in the AMP/ATP ratio and NAD+/NADH ratio. The former has a direct impact on the
  activation of AMPK as binding of AMP (or ADP) facilitates phosphorylation (p) of
  AMPK by upstream kinases. Activated AMPK phosphorylates PGC-1α directly, which may
  either activate this coactivator or prime PGC-1α for activation via deacetylation
  by SIRT1. SIRT1 requires increased NAD+ levels for its activity as this nucleotide
  is a cosubstrate of the enzyme. Once in its deacetylated activated form PGC-1α is
  able to coactivate transcription of nuclear mitochondrial genes via transcription
  factors including NRF1/2, oestrogen-related receptor (ERR)α,β,γ (ERRs) and PPARα,β,γ.
  Consequently, this activates the mtDNA transcription, translation and replication
  machinery (represented by mtDNA); production of OXPHOS subunits; tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle enzymes and FAO enzymes. This ultimately leads to mitochondrial proliferation
  and increased mitochondrial mass. Resveratrol is an activator of SIRT1. The exact
  mechanism of activation is still unresolved but ultimately results in activation
  of the PGC-1α pathway via increased deacetylation of the coactivator. AICAR is phosphorylated
  into its ZMP analogue, an AMP mimetic, and can directly activate AMPK by promoting
  the phosphorylation of AMPK by upstream kinases. Activation of AMPK causes phosphorylation
  of PGC-1α, and SIRT1 activation via AMPK-induced increases in the NAD+/NADH ratio.
  Bezafibrate is a PPAR pan-agonist and therefore able to activate PPAR-regulated
  gene expression, which includes the expression of PGC-1α via the PPAR-responsive
  element in its promoter region. The increase in PGC-1α levels is believed to be
  sufficient for activation of the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway. For more details
  see the text or reviews (Fernandez-Marcos and Auwerx, ; Scarpulla et al., ; Wenz,
  ).
