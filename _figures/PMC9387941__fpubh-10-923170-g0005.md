caption: Metabolic pathways among NC, MT and MTS groups. Bubble diagram of the metabolic
  pathways of MTS vs. MT (A), MT vs. NC (B), and MTS vs. NC (C) in the ESI+ model.
  Bubble diagram of the metabolic pathways of MTS vs. MT (D), MT vs. NC (E) and MTS
  vs. NC (F) in the ESI- model. The –ln(p) values from the pathway enrichment analysis
  are indicated on the horizontal axis, and impact values are indicated on the vertical
  axis. The colors and sizes of the shapes represent the effects of the pairwise comparison,
  and the larger red shapes indicate a greater effect on the pathway. (G) Schematic
  overview of the metabolites with plasma levels significantly altered in multiple
  trauma complicated with sepsis. Metabolites with increased levels are in red and
  those with decreased levels are in blue; Solid lines denote direct reactions; dotted
  lines denote indirect reactions; arrowhead indicates direction of the reaction;
  double arrowhead indicates direction of the reversible reactions. (A–F) were drawn
  by R version 4.0.2.
