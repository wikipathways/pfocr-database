caption: Mode of action of DMXAA and its derivative HHMX in human and mice. Mouse-specific
  STING agonist DMXAA is a partial STING agonist interfering with agonistic STING
  activation in humans. Based on this data, we developed a novel DMXAA derivative,
  3-hydroxy-5-(4-hydroxybenzyl)-4-methyl-9H-xhanthen-9one (HHMX), which could antagonize
  STING signaling pathway both in human and mice to become potential therapeutic agent
  for STING-associated autoinflammatory diseases, like SAVI
