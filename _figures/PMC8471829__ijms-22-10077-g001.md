caption: Metabolic pathway of inorganic arsenic demonstrating the reduction of arsenate
  to arsenite with the enzyme arsenate reductase mediated by glutathione (GSH), which
  further undergoes oxidative methylation through the enzyme arsenite methyltranferase
  mediated by S-adenosyl methionine, with conversion to MMA and DMA. Finally, all
  the metabolites are excreted through urine, among which DMA is the major metabolite
  (60–80%). (As- arsenic, DMA-dimethyl arsenic acid, MMA-monomethyl arsenic acid,
  GSH-glutathione).
