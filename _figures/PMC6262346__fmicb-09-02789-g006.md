caption: Cellular metabolic flux distributions. Metabolic flux analysis of B. megaterium
  QM B1551 during feeding on (A) [1,2-13C2]-glucose or (B) a mixture of [1,2,3-13C3]-glucose,
  [1,6-13C2]-fructose, and unlabeled xylose. All fluxes were normalized to 100% glucose
  uptake and the thickness of each arrow was scaled to this flux percentage. Fluxes
  toward biomass production are shown in red. Gluconate excretion is shown in blue.
  Flux values (average ± data range) were generated using experimental data from two
  independent biological replicates, at OD600 = 2. Growth curves in Supplementary
  Figure  indicate when data were acquired during biomass growth. Definitions for
  metabolite abbreviations are as shown in Figure  caption.
