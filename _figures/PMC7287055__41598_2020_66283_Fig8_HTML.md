caption: A proposed mechanism of an inflammatory response in differentiating or differentiated
  3T3-L1 adipocytes triggered by LPS, LCB or LCB-RM. Fungal-like particles namely
  LCB was created from laminarin and polystyrene beads. LCB binds to a specific, unidentified
  surface receptor on adipocytes. The receptor subsequently triggers a downstream
  signaling pathway, leading to the activation of the IKK complex, which consists
  of IKKα, IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO subunits. The activation of the IKK complex can be inhibited
  by SC-514, a specific inhibitor of the IKKβ subunit. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates
  the IκBα protein, which forms a complex with NF-κB, a heterodimer of p50 (NF-κB1)
  and p65 (RelA) subunits. Phosphorylated IκBα is targeted for destruction by the
  26S proteasome complex, causing the release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB.
  NF-κB promotes transcription and production of inflammatory cytokines, leading to
  inflammation of adipose tissue.
