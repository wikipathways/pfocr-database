caption: Protein lactonylation modification is an important influence in the process
  that is HIF-1-mediated HMGB1 activity. 1. Lactate, as a metabolite of cellular adaptation
  to hypoxic environments, is mainly produced by glycolysis. MCT1 and MCT4 are mainly
  responsible for the cellular uptake and release of lactate. Elevated intracellular
  lactate levels not only promote the translocation of HIF-1α from the cytoplasm to
  the nucleus to regulate gene expression but also stabilize the structure and enhance
  the biological activity of HIF-1 by promoting HIF-1 lactylation. Furthermore, lactate
  can promote the expression of HIF-1α by directly or indirectly enhancing the activation
  of mTOR. However, lactate can upregulate STAT6 expression by promoting histone lactylation,
  thereby blocking PDGFRβ/PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated HIF-1 expression. 2. Activated HIF-1
  promotes the secretion and activation of HMGB1, which is secreted into the extracellular
  compartment and promotes the migration of YAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
  by binding to TLR2, thereby promoting the activation of HIF-1. Meanwhile, HMGB1,
  by binding to TLR4, not only directly promotes the migration of HIF-1 to the nucleus
  to exert transcriptional regulation but also activates the MYD88/NF-κB pathway to
  enhance the expression of HIF-1. However, HIF-1α can reduce the expression of HMGB1
  by upregulating the transcript level of lncRNA NEAT1, thereby blocking the excessive
  activation of HIF-1 induced by HMGB1. The lncRNA NEAT1 can stabilize the structure
  of PGK1 by binding to PGK1, which mediates the glycolysis/lactate/HIF-1α pathway
  by increasing LDH activity, but HIF-1 can promote lactate efflux by upregulating
  the expression of MCT4, which blocks the excessive activation of HIF-1 induced by
  lactate. Furthermore, PTEN could block HIF-1 expression, which is mediated by the
  PDGFRβ/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway, by inhibiting AKT, thereby reducing HMGB1-induced
  release of cellular inflammatory factors. Protein kinase B (AKT); hypoxia-inducible
