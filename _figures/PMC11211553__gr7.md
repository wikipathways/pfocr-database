caption: A proposed working model of plant cuticle genes involved in organ initiation
  and development during the skotomorphogenesis-to-photomorphogenesis transition.During
  etiolated growth, genes involved in cuticle synthesis, such as BDG1, LACS2, and
  DCR, gradually increase in expression to promote chloroplast development, the auxin
  signaling pathway, and the expression of PIFs and HLS1 and to repress protein synthesis,
  resulting in proper skotomorphogenesis. During photomorphogenesis, light signaling
  represses the expression of BDG1, LACS2, and DCR and consequent cuticle synthesis,
  which lead to de-repressed expression of cell-cycle genes, increased CK activity,
  and hypoxia, resulting in the activation of SAM and consequent organ initiation
  and development
