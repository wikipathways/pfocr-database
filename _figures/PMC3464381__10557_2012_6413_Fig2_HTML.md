caption: visualization of the proposed cardioprotective mechanism of action of metformin
  in the human heart after myocardial infarction, resulting in improved systolic and
  diastolic function. In experimental models metformin has been consistently associated
  with enhanced phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) [–]. In the
  myocardium, characterized by high energy demands and low energy reserves, AMPK plays
  a pivotal role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis [–]. Metformin-induced AMPK
  phosphorylation may be mediated by inhibition of complex 1 of the respiratory chain,
  by upstream activation of the tumor suppressor gene liver kinase B1 (LKB1), or by
  decreased AMP–deaminase activity [–]. AMPK phosphorylation leads to activation of
  the Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway including phospatidylinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) and Akt pathways [, ], upregulation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 [],
  inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [], and upregulation of endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [, ]. Activation of the RISK pathway and eNOS improves
  mitochondrial function and inhibits opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mPTP) []. The mPTP is a major mediator of myocardial reperfusion injury. Opening
  of the mPTP results in ATP depletion and cell death [, ]. Further, prevention of
  mPTP opening stimulates mitochondrial respiration, improving ATP availability and
  cellular function []. Upregulated p53 and inhibited mTOR, partly RISK pathway mediated,
  are associated with decreased cellular vulnerability by preventing post-mitotic
  cell death and improved resilience to ischemia related injury [, ]. Metformin mediated
  eNOS production, next to increasing nitric oxide production, enhances sodium pump
  activity causing decreased intracellular calcium levels []. In infarcted tissue,
  this may attenuate microvascular obstruction and thereby prevent mPTP mediated cell
  death []. In functional myocardium, optimized calcium handling results in improved
  contractility and relaxation []. Further, independent of AMPK, metformin inhibits
  transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 myocardial expression, decreasing collagen synthesis
  and preventing fibrosis []. Metformin may also attenuate cardiac fibrosis by directly
  inhibiting advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) formation []. Also, metformin is
  associated with a decrease in dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity and an increase in
  circulating levels of glucagon-like peptide 1 []. In a porcine model of ischemia
  and reperfusion injury, stimulation with a analogue (exenatide) resulted in a reduction
  of infarct size []. Another target of metformin may be the increase of glucose utilisation
  of the heart. The adult heart mainly relies on fatty acids utilisation, and switches
  back to glucose when damaged. However, metabolic flexibility of the failing heart
  is limited, and facilitation of glucose utilisation by metformin via increase of
  glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4) may explain its salutary effects on the
  cardiac function [, ]
