caption: 'Tripterygium ingredients act on the CD8+ T cell. CD8+ T cells could be activated
  through three signals. The first signal of T cell activation comes from the specific
  binding of its receptor TCR to the antigen. The second signal of T cell activation
  comes from costimulatory molecules. Cytokines promote the full activation of T cells.
  Perforin and granzyme B are secreted to exert cellular immunity via the PI3K signaling
  pathway. In other cell types, tripterygium ingredients act on the PI3K signaling
  pathway to prohibit the activation of CD8+ T cells. Note: AKT (also known as PKB),
  Protein kinase B; PI3K, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; mTOR, Mechanistic target of rapamycin
  kinase; S6K, Ribosomal protein S6 kinase; TCR, T-cell receptor; 4EBP, 4E-binding
  protein.'
