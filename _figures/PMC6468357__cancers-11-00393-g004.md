caption: FOXK2 role as an oncogene in cancer. FOXK2 is transcriptionally regulated
  by the Sox9 oncogene and promotes proliferation of colorectal cancer cell lines.
  In this context, FOXK2 interacts with DVL, translocating it to the nucleus, and
  then promoting Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In agreement, FOXK2 overexpression
  promotes cell migration and proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma, which is
  associated with high levels of Survivin, c-Myc, p27, cyclin D1 and phosphorylated
  AKT protein expression. A role in cell cycle progression has also been attributed
  to FOXK2, which is phosphorylated by CDK-cyclin complexes in a cell cycle dependent
  manner, in a process that induces its degradation and impairs its transcriptional
  activity following cell division. Box represents associations between FOXK2 and
  other molecules in studies involving overexpression and inhibition of FOXK2. PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; Cyclin D1, regulator of cell cycle
  progression; p27, a cell cycle inhibitor; Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of
  apoptosis proteins (IAPs) family; c-myc, proto-oncogene transcription factor; DVL,
