caption: Catalytic cycle of P460 cofactors. The red pathway has been observed in HAO,
  whereas the red and black pathways have been observed in cyt P460. The gray line
  represents an off-pathway species. The {FeNO} and {FeNO} species are written in
  Enemark-Feltham notation, where the superscript represents the number of electrons
  in the d-manifold and the NO π* orbitals. Reproduced with permission from reference
