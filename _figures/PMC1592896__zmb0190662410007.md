caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed signaling cascade that regulates apoptosis
  and compensatory proliferation. First, apoptotic stimuli given to the cell activates
  RHG proteins. RHG proteins activate DRONC through inhibition of DIAP1 function.
  The signaling cascade bifurcates at DRONC, one pathway leading to apoptosis through
  cleavage of DRICE by DRONC. The other pathway leads to compensatory proliferation
  through cleavage of an as-yet-unknown factor (denoted as “X”) by DRONC. Cleavage
  of factor “X” activates JNK signaling, which induces compensatory proliferation
  through transcriptional upregulation of mitogens including DPP.
