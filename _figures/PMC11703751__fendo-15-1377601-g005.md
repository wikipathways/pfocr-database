caption: Regulatory mechanisms of S1P signaling in the progression of Type 1 Diabetes
  Mellitus (T1DM). S1P interacts with insulin receptors to influence the synthesis
  of insulin receptor substrates, subsequently mediating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
  and leading to insulin resistance. Additionally, S1P interacts with receptors on
  various cell types, regulating metabolic and inflammatory pathways crucial for the
  development of insulin resistance and T1DM. S1P signaling enhances Ca2+ influx and
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thereby impacting AKT activity and β-cell
  function. In INSIE cells and fibroblasts, S1P affects cAMP levels and the MAPK pathway,
  influencing PKA activity and inflammatory responses mediated by MKP-3, ERK1/2, NF-κB,
  TNF-α, and IL-6. These interactions collectively promote the regulation of glucose
  homeostasis and inflammation, key processes in the pathogenesis of T1DM. Sphs, sphingosines;
  SIP, sphingosine-1-phosphate; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, protein kinase
