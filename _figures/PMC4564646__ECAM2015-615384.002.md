caption: 'Glutathione redox cycle. Glutathione (GSH) is synthesized from the amino
  acids glutamate (Glu), cysteine (Cys), and glycine (Gly) in a two-step pathway requiring
  energy from ATP. Glu and Cys are combined via the action of glutamate cysteine ligase
  (GCL). This dipeptide then combines with Gly via a reaction from glutathione synthetase
  (GS). GSH undergoes a redox reaction using glutathione peroxidase GPx to detoxify
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The main source of
  H2O2 is from the conversion of superoxide anion (O2−∙) by the enzymatic action of
  superoxide dismutase (SOD). GSH is converted to an oxidized form (GSSG) and is recycled
  back to GSH by the enzymatic reaction of glutathione reductase (GR) which requires
  the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to form a redox
  cycle. NB: bold and underlined text represents enzymes.'
