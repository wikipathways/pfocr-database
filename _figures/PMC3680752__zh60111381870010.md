caption: 'A: the top-associated network as defined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  for NAc mRNAs upregulated in HVRs vs. LVRs included “cell morphology, cell death
  and survival, dermatological diseases and conditions” (11/35 pathway molecules:
  ↑ARHGAP18, ↑C11orf16, ↑C18orf54, ↑CFL1, ↑ECDHC2, ↑HLA-A, ↑HLA-E, ↑LYN, ↑MLH1, ↑PAFAH1B3,
  ↑RBM3). B: the top-associated network as defined by IPA for NAc mRNAs downregulated
  in HVRs vs. LVRs included “nervous system development and function, cell signaling,
  and molecular transport” (5/35 pathway molecules: ↓CAMKV, ↓OPRD1, ↓REXO4, ↓SLC24A4,
  ↓TBCD, ↓PRRT1).'
