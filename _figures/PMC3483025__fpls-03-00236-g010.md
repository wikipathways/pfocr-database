caption: Model summarizing control mechanisms that act on and are emitted from ALA
  biosynthesis. The contribution to plastid-derived retrograde signaling is highlighted.
  ALA formation is posttranslationally controlled by several known feedback mechanisms
  of the Chl and Mg branch of the pathway (e.g., heme, Mg chelatase assembly, GUN4)
  also reflecting the impact of the gun2-gun5 mutations on ALA synthesis. Intermediates
  of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway (e.g., Mg Protoporphyrin IX) were discussed
  to be involved in signaling pathways and likely act via reactive oxygen species
  (ROS)-mediated changes in nuclear gene expression (NGE). Gabaculine (GAB) directly
  inhibits ALA formation resulting in changes of NGE at very early stages of chloroplast
  development. Norflurazon (NF) inhibits tetrapyrrole biosynthesis indirectly.
