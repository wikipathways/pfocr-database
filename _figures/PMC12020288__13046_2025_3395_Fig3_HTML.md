caption: 'The RBPs as potential therapeutic targets for HCC. A Small interfering RNA:
  intracellular long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) is cleaved into siRNA under the action
  of nuclease Dicer. SiRNAs assemble with a variety of proteins to form the RNA induced
  silencing complex (RISC). The guide strand in RISC recognizes and binds its complementary
  target mRNA sequence by base complementary pairing. RISC binds to the target mRNA
  and cleaves the target mRNA. The ribosome cannot translate normally to produce the
  corresponding protein, which leads to the decrease of the expression level of the
  protein. B ZCCHC4 inhibits apoptosis signal transduction and promotes the chemical
  resistance of HCC cells to DDA by interacting with novel lncRNA AL133467.2. RBMX
  stabilizes the expression of LncBLACAT1, thus promoting the resistance of HCC to
  sorafenib. RBM38 reverses sorafenib resistance in HCC by binding to LncGAS5. C Drug
  research and development: cytoskeleton inhibitors latrunculin A and blebbistatin
  can target HuR and reduce the expression of HuR in HCC cells, thus playing an anti-cancer
  role. D CLDN1 monoclonal antibody inhibits tumor growth by regulating Notch signaling
  pathway and tumor immune microenvironment. Anti-CLDN6 monoclonal antibody and sorafenib
  have synergistic anti-HCC effect. E The small molecular compound VE821 significantly
  inhibited the expression of GRSF1/YY1 in HCC cells, and promoted the expression
  of miR- 30e- 5p in a dose-dependent manner. (-)-Gomisin M1 was found to target TARBP2
  and promote the binding of TARBP2 to Dicer, thus inhibiting PI3 K and MAPK signaling
  pathways and inhibiting the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells.
  F The combination therapy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and YTHDF1 knockout greatly
  inhibited the tumor metastasis induced by sublethal heat treatment. This encourages
  us to explore new methods and combine RFA with key intervention targets to achieve
  better therapeutic effects. The combination of circEYA3 and IGF2BP2 enhances the
  ability to stabilize DTX3L mRNA, and specifically reduces the DNA damage induced
  by 125I seed implantation therapy in HCC cells'
