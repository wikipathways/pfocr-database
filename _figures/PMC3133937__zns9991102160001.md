caption: Concerted regulation of the WNT-DVL-GSK3β signaling pathway in NAc by chronic
  social defeat stress. Genes are color-coded according to regulation seen in this
  brain region in previous genome-wide studies of mRNA expression levels or altered
  repressive histone methylation (; ; ; ). Red, Genes regulated by chronic social
  defeat stress in susceptible mice with reversal seen in resilient mice and after
  chronic antidepressant treatment; green, genes regulated by chronic social defeat
  stress in susceptible mice with reversal seen with antidepressant treatment; blue,
  genes regulated by resilience only; orange, genes regulated in susceptible mice
  only; yellow, genes regulated by chronic antidepressant treatment only. Frizzled,
  DVL, CK1, PROP1, and GSK3 displayed evidence of downregulation in the NAc of susceptible
  mice; WNT4, Axin2, and Groucho1, upregulation in susceptibility; β-catenin, upregulation
  in resilience; and Groucho6, upregulation after antidepressant treatment. The statistical
  criteria for such regulation are provided in the text. CK1, casein kinase 1; APC,
  adenomatous polyposis coli; PROP1, PROP paired-like homeobox 1; TCF/LEF, T-cell
  factor/lymphoid enhancer factor; Groucho, also known as TLE (transducin-like enhancers
  of split).
