caption: 'Canonical Wnt signaling pathway: In absence of Wnt ligand (left), the destruction
  complex, consisting of GSK-3β, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and axin, hyperphosphorylates
  β-catenin, which marks it for ubiquitination (Ub) and proteasomal degradation. Binding
  of Wnt ligand (right) to a frizzled (FZD)/lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)
  receptor complex leads to the phosphorylation of dishevelled (Dsh) inactivating
  GSK-3β and preventing the phosphorylation of β-catenin. Non-phosphorylated β-catenin
  shifts into the nucleus and forms a complex with T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer
  factor (LEF) activating transcription of Wnt target genes. Furthermore, the expression
  of zinc-finger transcription factors snail and slug is upregulated. They bind to
  E-boxes in E-cadherins promoter region and prevent its transcription. Suppresion
  of E-cadherin offers more available cytoplasmic β-catenin and induces a self-driven
  positive feedback loop. In conclusion, by losing E-cadherin as an adhesion molecule
  cells undergo EMT (Arend et al. ; Gasior et al. ; Gatcliffe et al. ). The three
  inhibitors (SB216763, XAV939 triptolide) used in this study, are shown in their
  typical domain'
