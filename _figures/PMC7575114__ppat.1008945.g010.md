caption: (A) The formation and secretion of HBV pgRNA-containing capsid and virion.
  See  for a brief description of the canonical HBV replication cycle. The cytoplasmic
  pgRNA is encapsidated with viral polymerase (pol) into capsid, which is enveloped
  and secreted through cellular MVB pathway to yield the infection-deficient RNA virion,
  or release to the extracellular environment as naked capsid via an undefined secretory
  mechanism. Blocking intracellular viral nucleocapsid formation by CpAM diminishes
  the production of pgRNA-containing particles; the inhibition of viral DNA replication
  by NA results in intracellular accumulation of pgRNA-containing capsid and may enhance
  the production of extracellular RNA virions and capsids. (B) The proposed mechanism
  for generating truncated serum/supernatant HBV pgRNA. Viral polymerase is schematically
  illustrated and the four major function domains are indicated, specifically the
  terminal protein (TP) domain, spacer domain, reverse transcriptase (RT) domain,
  and RNaseH (RH) domain. The unspliced and spliced pgRNA (indicated by internal dotted
  line) carrying an intact 5’ epsilon motif are packaged into the capsid, with the
  3’ portion downstream of DR1 being possibly left outside of the capsid and subsequently
  removed by cellular ribonuclease(s). Upon DNA priming catalyzed by viral polymerase
  at 5’ epsilon of the encapsidated pgRNA, the polymerase carries nascent DNA and
  translocates to the 3’ DR1 to initiate the minus-strand DNA elongation. The reverse
  transcription of pgRNA generates DNA:RNA hybrid and the RNA moiety is degraded by
  the RNaseH endonuclease activity of viral polymerase. The NA treatment stops viral
  DNA synthesis at various corresponding nucleotide positions downstream of DR1 due
  to its chain terminator effect, which results in further trimming of the 3’ end
  of capsid pgRNA at positions upstream of 3’ DR1 by HBV RNaseH. See text for more
  details.
