caption: Active methyl cycle and catabolism of glycine betaine in S. meliloti. Cyclic
  synthesis of methionine to produce the potent methyl donor SAM is known as the active
  methyl cycle. In S. meliloti, methionine generated from either methyl tetrahydrofolate
  or glycine betaine is converted to SAM, which, after sequential demethylations,
  regenerates homocysteine. The production of methionine from glycine betaine also
  yields dimethylglycine and is the first step of the catabolic degradation pathway
  of glycine betaine to pyruvate. The pathway and its associated genes are adapted
  from information provided by the KEGG database, the S. meliloti Rm1021 genome sequence,
  Barra et al., and Smith et al. (, , ). M-THF, methyl tetrahydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate;
  5,10-M-THF, N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate.
