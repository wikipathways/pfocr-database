caption: Subtypes defined in early transcriptional profiling efforts () are illustrated
  in the upper tier. TNBC subtypes () are illustrated in the salmon-colored boxes.
  Subtypes now defined as tumor intrinsic are in the blue area, and subtypes defined
  as due to invading immune or other stromal cells are in the green extrinsic area.
  The therapeutic actions proposed in the boxes are suggested by Jiang et al. and/or
  by the published literature. The question mark after the JAK/STAT suggestion reflects
  uncertainty about the utility of drugging a pathway that may be generated by invading
  stromal cells.
