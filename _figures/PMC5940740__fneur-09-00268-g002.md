caption: 'Diabetic stressors lead to Schwann cell dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
  (A) Schematic illustration of the main developmental transitions of Schwann cells.
  Dashed arrows denote the reversibility of the final stage, where mature myelinating
  and non-myelinating cells might dedifferentiate as a result of injury or disease.
  (B) Elevated glucose levels are shunted into the polyol pathway by aldose reductase,
  depleting cytosolic NADH, and ultimately reducing regeneration of glutathione, an
  important cellular antioxidant. Consequently, glucose metabolism generates local
  oxidative damage, reduces the production of neurotrophic factors, activates the
  ER stress, and causes DNA damage, all of which drives the cells to an immature phenotype.
  Signs of mitochondrial stress triggered by hyperglycemia are also evident in Schwann
  cells by the increased expression of ATP synthase subunits and respiratory chain
  complexes I, III, IV, and V, thus increasing oxygen consumption and apoptotic signaling
  events. As a result, acylcarnitines are released from stressed Schwann cells, leading
  to axonal degeneration and fiber loss. AGE activation of RAGE and/or TLR induces
  downstream signaling events mediated, at least in part, by the activation of MAPK
  and NF-κB with consequent transcription of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative
  stress molecules. Schwann cells have been recognized as immune-competent cells,
  expressing MHC class II molecules and several cytokine receptors such as IL-6R,
  IL-1R, and TNFR. Since MHC II antigen reactivity was detected in Schwann cells from
  patients suffering from diabetic neuropathy, it is plausible that these cells might
  be functioning as antigen processing and presenting cells contributing to immune
  responses within the peripheral nerves. Abbreviations: AGE, advanced glycation end
  products; RAGE, receptor for advanced glycation end products; TLRS, toll-like receptors;
  MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; P0, protein 0; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB;
  NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase; IGF1, insulin-like growth
  factor 1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CSP-9, caspase-9;
  IL-6R, interleukin-6 receptor; IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor
  receptor; MHCII, major histocompatibility complex II.'
