caption: 'Biological processes of the canonical Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. The
  major steps in the canonical Hh signaling pathway in mammals have been elucidated:
  Hh biogenesis, release, transmission, reception, and intracellular transduction.
  (A). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Hh ligand undergoes two sequential lipid
  modifications, including cholesterol added by an autoprocessing reaction and palmitate
  attached by Hh acetyltransferase (Hhat). Dispatched homologue 1 (DISP1) then transfers
  the Hh ligand to its carrier, the cubulin (CUB) domain of epidermal growth factor
  (EGF)-like protein 2 (SCUBE2). This SCUBE2-mediated soluble complex enables the
  long-range transport of the hydrophobic Hh ligand in the intercellular matrix to
  the Hh-receiving cell. (B). In the absence of the Hh ligand (pathway-off), patched
  (PTCH), located on the primary cilium (PC), inhibits Smoothened (SMO) as a sterol
  transporter, which means sterols are barely accessible to SMO. As a result, SMO
  remains inactive in the cytoplasm. Simultaneously, glioma-associated oncogene (GLI)
  interacts with the suppressor of fused (SUFU) to form a complex, which undergoes
  phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β), and
  casein kinase 1 (CK1). This is followed by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via β-transducin
  repeat-containing protein (βTRCP), producing a truncated repressor form of GLI (GLIR),
  which inhibits the transcription of target genes. (C). In the presence of the Hh
  ligand (pathway-on), the binding of the Hh ligand to PTCH is facilitated via co-receptors
  such as those cell adhesion molecule-related/downregulated by oncogenes (CDO), brother
  of CDO (BOC), and growth arrest-specific protein 1 (GAS1). The Hh-PTCH compound
  then leaves the ciliary membrane and is degraded, which can generate the environment
  where SMO can be accessible to sterols and be activated. Kinesin protein 3 (Kif3)
  and β-arrestin mediate the movement of SMO from the cytoplasm into the PC. CK1 and
  G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) phosphorylate SMO to be fully activated,
  allowing the SUFU/ GLI complex to enter the PC with the assistance of Kif7. Once
  at the tip of the PC, GLI dissociates from SUFU and remains in its full-length active
  form (GLIA). GLIA then translocates to the nucleus, where it drives the transcription
  of target genes'
