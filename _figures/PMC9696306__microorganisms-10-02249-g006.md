caption: Hypothesized carbon metabolism at the cathode including the carbon fixation
  pathways of reductive acetyl-CoA pathway in Archaeoglobales and methanogens, reverse
  TCA cycle in Aquificales, and acetate and formate metabolism in Thermococcales,
  entering anabolic as well as catabolic processes including the use of different
  electron acceptors in respiration. Compounds yielded in our experiments are highlighted
  in red. Yellow labels represent the enzymes or equivalent enzymes involved in the
  pathways retrieved in the genome of the strains or close relative if not available
  and marked by a colored square if present for each strain (dark blue = GA, orange
  = FP, green = AF, yellow = TO, light blue = MT, and red = Apy). The grey labels
  represent enzymes not retrieved in the literature for those strains, suggesting
  an alternative pathway. For correspondence to complete name, please refer to .
