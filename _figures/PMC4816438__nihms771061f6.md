caption: 'Working model for the acute hypotensive effect of SCFA delivery on BP. Gpr41
  acts to decrease BP in response to SCFAs, whereas Olfr78 acts in opposition to increase
  BP. In WT animals, the hypotensive response of Gpr41 prevails. When Olfr78 is genetically
  deleted, the hypotensive response is further accentuated, as the brake on the pathway
  has been removed. However, when Gpr41 is genetically deleted, the hypotensive response
  is absent, and instead a slight hypertensive response (presumably mediated by Olfr78)
  remains. Abbreviations: BP, blood pressure; KO, knockout; SCFA, short-chain fatty
  acid; WT, wild type. Reprinted with permission from Pluznick ().'
