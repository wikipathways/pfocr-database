caption: Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Extracellular TLRs include TLR1, TLR2,
  TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR10 and TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are located intracellularly
  within the endosome. Aside from TLR3, all other TLRs operate through MyD88 leading
  to activation of NF-κB and subsequent inflammatory cytokine gene transcription and
  expression. This is an example of canonical pathway utilization; however, other
  subunits can be activated. TLR3 operates through the TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing
  interferon-β pathway, while TLR4 can activate both pathways. MyD88 activates the
  IRAK complex (containing protein kinase IRAK4) leading to subsequent activation
  of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. Activation of the IKK complex leads to phosphorylation
  and degradation of IκBα and translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and production
  of inflammatory cytokines. TLR3 activation of TNF receptor-associated factor 3 results
  in transcription of type I interferons.
