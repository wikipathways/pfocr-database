caption: 'Molecular, cellular, and network mechanisms of encoding sequences. The internal
  temporal structure of any episodic memory is established by first assigning a theta
  phase (red inset diagram depicted next to the ring attractors) to each entity represented
  (three are shown in the Figure: A, B, and C) by a currently active EPISODE module.
  This theta phase serves to indicate whether the entity is upcoming, current, or
  already experienced and is repeated several times as several theta cycles unfold
  during the mnemonic episode to be encoded. As the temporal status of an entity (A,
  B, or C) changes, a directly measurable phenomenon, the so-called “phase precession”
  [] is observed. Importantly, the generation and the repetition of the phase code
  in the entorhinal cortex is simply explained by the intrinsic electrophysiological
  and network properties of ring attractors. The theta phase is first transmitted
  to the dentate granule cells (depicted as “GC”) via the perforant pathway, then
  to the pyramidal CA3 neurons of the hippocampus via the mossy fibers as indicated
  by inset diagrams. Sequences are generated in the recurrent network of the CA3 using
  the phase code derived from the entorhinal EPISODE modules by the following mechanism:
  adjacent elements of the sequence produce coincident signals at the recurrent CA3-CA3
  synapses given that the earlier signal (such as “A” in the Figure) suffers a delay
  when traveling along the recurrent collaterals and thus becomes coincident with
  a later one (such as “B” in the Figure) thereby making NMDA dependent plasticity
  possible (grey dot encircled with red). Sequences are generated by linking adjacent
  pairs first (in the Figure binding B to A and binding C to B is shown). The Figure
  is provided only to demonstrate the principle, therefore, several aspects are strongly
  simplified: (i) further cell types of the entorhinal ring attractors are not shown;
  (ii) the theta phase is also shifted during the entorhino–hippocampal transmission
  of the signal (inheritance of the phase precession), however, this results in the
  same amount of delay for all the entities (A, B, C) thus this aspect is not shown,
  and (iii) all the entities are represented by a population of cells, therefore,
  a population of “A” neurons becomes bound to a population of “B” neurons in CA3,
  etc.; however, for the sake of simplicity, only one neuron represents each population
  in the Figure. For details, the reader is referred to Reference [].'
