caption: Schematic overview of the proposed mechanisms of HMGB1 release and its biological
  activity after acute stroke. A, After acute vessel occlusion, cells of the hypoperfused
  territory become necrotic and release HMGB1 from its nuclear localization. Between
  2 and 24 h after ischemia onset, the (C23-C45) disulphide “cytokine HMGB1” becomes
  the predominant HMGB1 isoform. B, Differential effects of HMGB1 in the spleen (left)
  and bone marrow (right) in the acute phase (<24 h) after stroke. Splenic monocytes
  are activated via a RAGE-dependent pathway, producing increased amounts of proinflammatory
  cytokines. In the bone marrow, HMGB1 induces proliferation of immature monocytes
  and their release to the circulation. C, The expanded population of (bone marrow-derived)
  immature monocytes has features of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which inhibit
  lymphocyte activation via arginase (ARG1) secretion and might induce lymphocyte
  apoptosis. Splenic and circulating APCs have an “exhausted” phenotype characterized
  by reduced MHC-II expression and decreased cytokine production upon stimulation.
  Inadequate costimualtory signaling to lymphocyte induces T-cell dysfunction and
  might lead to apoptosis. Additionally, increased catecholamine levels in the subacute
  phase after stroke result in impaired monocyte function and lymphocyte reduction
  probably independent of HMGB1-RAGE signaling.
