caption: Signaling modulating adherens junctions (AJs). Agonists increase intracellular
  Ca2+, which, by activating the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) and RhoA-Rho kinase
  pathway, induces actin stress fiber formation, leading to disruption of AJs. Additionally,
  protein kinase C (PKC), Src, and end-binding protein 3 (EB3) disrupt AJs adhesion
  by either phosphorylating them or by increasing microtubule dynamics. Several mechanisms
  are activated in parallel or synergistically to induce re-annealing of AJs. For
  example, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylates neural Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome
  protein (N-WASP), enabling actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) to mediate cortical
  actin formation. Activated N-WASP also links p120-catenin to Arp2/3 and actin to
  stabilize AJs. FAK also induces Rac1 activity by inhibiting RhoA activity, which
  may further stabilize AJs. Activated Cdc42 may merge with FAK signaling to restore
  AJs formation.
