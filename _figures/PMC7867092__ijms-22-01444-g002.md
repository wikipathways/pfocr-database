caption: 'Leptin-promoted lipid metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. Leptin modulates
  cancer cell specific lipid metabolism through concerted actions on biosynthesis,
  degradation, and uptake of fatty acids. On the one hand, leptin stimulates de novo
  fatty lipid biosynthesis through activation of SREBPs in a PI3K/Akt/mTORC1-dependent
  mechanism. Activation of lipogenesis by leptin offers proliferative facilitates
  to tumor cells via promotion of membrane biogenesis, post-transcriptional modulation
  of protein (e.g., palmitoylation and acetylation), and lipid-based signal transduction.
  On the other, leptin increases fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) to meet a high-energy
  demand for rapid growth of tumor cells. To do so, leptin transcriptionally activates
  CPT1B via upregulation of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway to promote transportation
  of fatty acids into mitochondria. In addition, autophagy induction and elevated
  CD36-mediated uptake of exogenous fatty acids further increases availability of
  free fatty acids to fuel FAO. Together, the alterations in lipid metabolism have
  been demonstrated to critically contribute to oncogenic effects of leptin. Akt:
  protein kinase B, CD36: cluster of differentiation 36, CPT1B: the carnitine palmitoyl
  transferase 1B; IRS: the insulin receptor substrate, JAK: Janus kinase, mTORC1:
  mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, ObR: the leptin receptor, PI3K: phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase, SREBPs: sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, STAT3: signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3.'
