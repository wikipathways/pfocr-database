caption: GRK2 plays a diverse role in fibrosis-associated pathways. The phosphorylation
  of GRK2 by different kinases (PKA) also modifies kinase activity and substrate selection.
  GRK2 can regulate many downstream molecules and participates in the multiple signaling
  pathways. It not only activates PI3K/Akt, but also inhibits Akt/eNOS pathway to
  lower NO production. Activation of ERK1/2 pathway contributes to apoptosis. GRK2
  promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation, while ERK1/2 inhibits GRK2 phosphorylation. GRK2
  and NF-κB can advance their activation through each other. Meanwhile, GRK2 inhibits
  Epac1/Rap1 pathway and inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines. However,
  GRK2 promotes the phosphorylation of STAT1/3, which promotes the accumulation of
  inflammatory cytokines and contributes to the occurrence and development of fibrotic
  diseases.
