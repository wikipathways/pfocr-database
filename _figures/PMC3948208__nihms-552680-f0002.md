caption: CBP deficiency leads to HMT-mediated epigenetic modification. Induction of
  HMT such as ESET/SETDB1, a H3K9-specific methyltransferase, by CBP deficiency via
  a nonconventional pathway can elevate the level of H3K9me3, a histone code for gene
  silencing, and increase the condensation of heterochromatin. The alteration of gene
  transcription ultimately contributes to neuronal dysfunction. For example, H3K9me3-induced
  heterochromatin condensation results in the repression of CHRM1 gene and subsequent
  reduction of CHRM1 protein in neurons. The reduction of CHRM1 fails to respond to
  acetylcholine (Ach) from cholinergic interneurons and to transduce G-protein-coupled
  intracellular Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway. As a result, deregulation of CHRM1-dependent
  synaptic function may contribute to behavioral abnormality (modified from ).
