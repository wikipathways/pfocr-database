caption: Fibrin and fibrinogen interact with receptors on nervous system cells to
  activate downstream signalling, regulate basic cellular functions and influence
  inflammatory, neurodegenerative and repair processes in disease,,,. Fibrinogen is
  composed of three distinct polypeptides, designated Aα, Bβ and γ, which contain
  multiple binding sites for cellular receptors and proteins. Grey-shaded areas designate
  the location of binding sites, with fibrinogen amino acid sequence numbers and the
  corresponding receptor or bound protein listed above the site. Fibrinogen chain
  Aα (blue) binds plasminogen/tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), fibronectin
  and latent transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and interacts with the integrin receptors
  α5β1 (), αvβ3 () and αvβ8 () through its Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) motif. Fibrinogen chain
  Bβ (green) binds vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin; also known as CDH5),
  very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and amyloid-β. Fibrinogen chain γ
  (red) binds tPA, the integrin receptors CD11b/CD18, and αIIbβ3 (); it also binds
  intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (not shown on figure). Upon activation of the
  coagulation, fibrinogen is converted into insoluble fibrin by thrombin, which cleaves
  fibrinopeptide A and B from fibrinogen (red triangles) to expose polymerization
  sites that facilitate clot formation. Fibrinogen, fibrin and fibrin degradation
  products produce different responses from CNS cells. Soluble fibrinogen can induce
  growth factor receptor pathway activation in astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor
  cells (OPCs) and neurons to regulate scar formation, cell differentiation and inhibition
  of neurite outgrowth, respectively,,. Fibrinogen and fibrin also exert biological
  effects on mature oligodendrocytes and pericytes (see ). Conversion of fibrinogen
  into fibrin or immobilization of fibrinogen to a substrate exposes cryptic epitopes,
  such as the γ377–395 epitope, which is the binding site for the CD11b/CD18 integrin
  receptor,. Indeed, immobilized fibrinogen or fibrin activates microglia and macrophages,,.
  Similar to soluble fibrinogen, immobilized fibrinogen inhibits OPC maturation. 3D
  fibrin gels have also been utilized for testing Schwann cell differentiation and
  migration,. 3D fibrin gels are ideally suited for the study of mechanisms of fibrin
  degradation and the discovery of novel mechanisms in the CNS that regulate fibrinolysis.
  Indeed, the discovery of the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (NGFR) as
  a regulator of PLAT and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) transcriptional
  regulation was facilitated by the culture of Schwann cells on 3D fibrin gels,. Studies
  to methodically compare the responses of CNS cells to all the potential forms of
  fibrinogen, fibrin and fibrin degradation products are required to associate fibrinogen
  structure and function with an observed biological outcome. These studies can be
  influenced by the experimental setting, the purity of fibrinogen preparations, the
  methods of primary cell isolation and the stage of cell differentiation at the time
  of fibrinogen or fibrin treatment. ACVR1, activin A receptor type 1; P-AKT, phosphorylated
