caption: Mechanisms of action for therapeutic agents in treating or preventing HAE.
  Multiple pathways are capable of complement activation and generating inflammatory
  mediators including complement anaphylatoxins C3a and, more important, C5a. Activation
  of the final complement cascade produces a membrane attack complex that produces
  cellular injury. Angioedema occur after tissue injury from multiple causes. Tissue
  injury can activate contact activation (Hageman factor or factor XII) to generate
  kallikrein from prekallikrein, its precursor. Kallikrein in turn generates and activates
  plasmin from plasminogen, and plasmin can directly activate the C1 esterase complex
  to initiate complement activation. Under normal circumstances, C1-INH functions
  to inhibit both complement activation and, to a lesser extent, modulate contact
  activation. In HAE-C1-INH, because of quantitative or qualitative detective C1-INH,
  the pathway proceeds unchecked, generating mediators that increase capillary permeability
  to produce angioedema. Therapeutic approaches are directed at acutely restoring
  C1-INH levels, inhibiting kallikrein with ecallantide, inhibiting bradykinin with
  icatibant, and inhibiting plasmin with the lysine analogue tranexamic acid. Attenuated
  androgens have been used to increase liver synthesis of C1-INH. Figure and description
