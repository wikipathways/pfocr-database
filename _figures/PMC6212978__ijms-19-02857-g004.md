caption: Transcript levels of genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis in D.
  officinale stems. (A) simplified model of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway;
  (B) qRT-PCR analysis of the transcript abundance of the anthocyanin biosynthesis-related
  genes in peels of green and red stems. Red/green expression ratio is equal to the
  ratio between the transcript levels of red stems and the transcript levels of green
  stems. ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase; DFR, Dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H,
  flavonoid 3′5′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase.
  p value of expression ratio between red and green stems is calculated with a student’s
  t-test.
