caption: The role of scaffolds KSR and Ste5 in MAPK signaling. (A) In quiescent cells
  an inactive KSR/MEK complex exists in the cytosol. (B) Upon stimulation of the cell,
  KSR translocates to the cell membrane and forms an active complex with phosphorylated
  Raf, MEK, ERK. Activated ERK detaches from the scaffold with three outcomes; (1)
  ERK dimerizes in the cytoplasm where the dimer remains or translocates to the nucleus;
  (2) ERK translocates to the nucleus; (3) KSR acts as a platform where ERK dimers
  are assembled and the new complex can interact with substrates in the cytoplasm.
  (C) Schematic of the yeast mating pheromone response pathway.
