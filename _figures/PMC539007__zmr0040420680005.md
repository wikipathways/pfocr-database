caption: Lipid A biosynthesis. Biosynthesis pathways of lipid A in the different endosymbiotic
  bacteria are shown. Steps missing in the respective organisms are highlighted in
  grey; e.g., Buchnera is missing the entire pathway. In contrast, in “Candidatus
  Blochmannia” and Wigglesworthia, only the final steps involving acylation of KDO2-lipid
  IVa are partially missing.
