caption: Differentially expressed genes in Apoptosis Pathway (rno04210) using transcriptomic
  data at 168 h after TMT administration. Upregulated genes (Q-value < 0.05, Log₂
  fold change > 0.58) are marked with blue and an upward-pointing triangle (▲) next
  to the gene name, while downregulated genes (Q-value < 0.05, Log₂ fold change < −0.58)
  are marked with red and a downward-pointing triangle (▼) next to the gene name.
  Genes with no significant change are shown with an unfilled (white) box. Shading
  intensity represents the magnitude of log₂ fold change, with darker shading indicating
  larger expression changes. Apoptotic processes are critical in TMT-induced neurodegeneration,
  mediating programmed cell death in affected hippocampal neurons
