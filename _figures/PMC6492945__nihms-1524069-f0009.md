caption: Diagram of the proposed Mac-1 signaling pathway that regulates the human
  FOXP1 gene expression. FOXP1 is a multi-promoter gene with both positive (FOXP1-IT1
  lncRNA, CaMKIIδ) and negative (IRAK1 and HDAC4) regulators of gene expression. Ligand
  engagement and integrin clustering initiates “outside-in” signaling by Mac-1 that
  is accompanied by physical interaction between Mac-1 and IRAK1. The figure highlights
  localization of regulatory factors of FOXP1 gene in different cellular compartments,
  which change when cell transits from the status of Mac-1 non-clustering (upper panel)
  to that of Mac-1 ligand engagement and clustering (lower panel).
