caption: A, Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and the metabolic labeling strategy
  of UDP-GlcNAc from 13C-glucose. Species that are heavy labeled are marked with an
  asterisk. B, Modification cycle of O-GlcNAcylation. Protein O-GlcNAcylation reaction
  involves a UDP-GlcNAc cofactor and two enzymes that are O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)
  and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) that add and remove the O-GlcNAc moiety, respectively. C,
  Workflow for the O-GlcNAc peptide analysis, including isotopic labeling, sample
  preparation, mass spectrometry, and quantification.
