caption: Role of distinct STAT2 and/or IRF9-dependent pathways in the regulation of
  distinct subset of antiviral and immunoregulatory genes in response to IFNβ and
  TNF. Our data supports a model in which multiple pathways participate to the synergistic
  action of IFNβ + TNF. While the STAT1-dependent pathway, likely ISFG3, is engaged
  downstream of IFNβ and TNF, STAT1-independent pathways are also involved in the
  control of the delayed gene expression. STAT2 and IRF9 act not only in a concerted
  fashion, likely as a complex, but also independently. IRF9 is known to act as the
  DNA-binding subunit of the ISGF3 complex and therefore likely mediates binding of
  STAT2/IRF9 complexes and of alternative complexes devoid of STAT2. The mechanisms
  of STAT2-dependent regulation of gene expression remains to be characterized.
