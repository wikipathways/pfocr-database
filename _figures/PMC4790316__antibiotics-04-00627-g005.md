caption: The schematic diagram of the pur pathway. The disruption of genes (purB,
  F, H, M) involved in the purine biosynthesis pathway may cause defects in downstream
  energy production, amino acid biosynthesis and urea cycle, which may be responsible
  for the defect in persistence observed in this study to rifampicin and other antibiotics
  and stresses.
