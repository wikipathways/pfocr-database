caption: 'The Hippo signaling network in mammals. In the signaling diagram, the proteins
  that contain WW domains or PPxY ligand motif are in orange. “L” denotes an unknown
  ligand, and “R” denotes its cognate but still unknown receptor. L and R are engaged
  by cell-to-cell contacts and activate the pathway. JUB, also known as AJUBA, transduces
  signals from sites of cell adhesion. JUB has an inhibitory function on SAV1 (SALVADOR
  1) adapter protein and LATS kinases. RASSF is a family of Ras association domain–containing
  proteins that stimulate or inhibit MST kinases. MOB1 is the Mps One Binder kinase
  activator-like 1B protein, whose binding to LATS activates its kinase activity.
  TFs = transcription factors, examples of which are as follows: TEAD = TEA domain
  proteins that have a conserved DNA binding domain and can function as repressors
  or activators of gene transcription; PPARγ = peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  γ; PAX3 = paired box 3 protein; p73 = a member of the p53 family of proteins implicated
  in apoptotic signaling; RUNX = runt-related transcription factor; TTF-1 = transcription
  termination factor-1; CTGF = connective tissue growth factor, one of the genes induced
  by YAP/TEAD nuclear signaling. Other abbreviations are described in the text.'
