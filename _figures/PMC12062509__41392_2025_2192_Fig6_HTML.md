caption: 'Mechanism of cuproptosis. The mechanism of cuproptosis includes both mitochondrial-dependent
  and mitochondrial-independent pathways. Excess copper (II) enters the mitochondria,
  where it is reduced to the more toxic copper (I) by the mitochondrial protein FDX1.
  FDX1 also promotes protein lipoylation by directly binding to the LIAS and enhancing
  its interaction with the GCSH. Copper (I) binding induces the aggregation of DLAT
  and destabilizes Fe-S cluster proteins, triggering cellular stress responses that
  result in cuproptosis. Additionally, DSF/Cu mediates the aggregation and conformation
  lock of the Npl4-p97 protein in the cytoplasm, inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome
  degradation pathway, which contributes to proteotoxic stress and cuproptosis. Created
  by BioRender. Abbreviations: FDX1 ferredoxin 1, LIAS lipoic acid synthase, GCSH
  glycine cleavage system protein H, DLAT Dihydrolipoamide S-Acetyltransferase, Fe-S
  cluster iron-sulfur cluster, DSF Disulfiram, Npl4 an adaptor of the p97 segregase
  (also known as VCP)'
