caption: Regulation of glycolysis and glucose transporters in breast cancer. Important
  signaling pathways regulating glycolysis and glucose transporters in breast cancer
  are the PI3K/AKT, AMPK, and mTOR pathways. PI3K/AKT pathway activated by 17-estradiol
  (E2) or genetic mutations increases expression of PFK2 and GLUT. AMPK pathway activated
  in breast cancer transports GLUT4 to cell membrane through activation of PFK-2 and
  increases GLUT expression. mTORC1 among the mTOR complex increases the expression
  of PFK by activating HIF-1α. mTORC2 either activates AKT or increases GLUT1 expression.
  Transcription factors regulating glucose metabolism in breast cancer are c-myc,
  p53, and HIF-1α. As such, breast cancer with p53 mutation shows increased expression
  of GLUT because c-myc induces increased expression of GLUT, HK, and PFK, and p53
  suppresses expression of GLUT. Lastly, activated HIF-1α increases expressions of
  HK, PFK, LDHA, and GLUT, and suppresses mitochondrial function by activating PKD1
  and MXII. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT, Ak strain transforming protein kinase
