caption: Strategy to find direct targets of Ey. (A) The Drosophila retinal determination
  network. Retinal cell fate is established by an interregulatory network of conserved
  nuclear factors. toy induces ey, which induces so and eya, which induce dac. This
  pathway receives input from secreted signals from the hh and dpp pathways, which
  promote retinal determination, and the wg pathway that inhibits it. Several other
  genes are necessary and/or sufficient for eye development, including Optix and eyegone
  (eyg). These factors establish competency for the next stage of development, photoreceptor
  differentiation, whose first step, R8 recruitment, requires genes such as ato and
  sens. (B) Genes that upregulated by ey were identified by conducting microarray
  analysis of wild-type versus dpp-GAL4/UAS-ey discs. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
  and hand curation through comparison to online databases were used to evaluate the
  results. We searched for possible Ey binding sites in this list of 188 genes, identifying
  20 putative direct targets. Expression pattern and response to ey was examined by
  in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. In vitro Ey binding was tested by EMSAs. Reporter
  analysis of fragments containing identified Ey binding sites was used to test their
  function in vivo.
