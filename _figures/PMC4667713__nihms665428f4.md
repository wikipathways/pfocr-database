caption: '[U-13C]Glutamate (GLU) may be completely metabolized to CO2 via the “pyruvate
  recycling pathway”. Initially [U-13C]glutamate is converted to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)
  catalyzed mainly by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle [U-13C]malate (MAL)/oxaloacetate (OAA) is formed. [U-13C]Malate may be oxidatively
  decarboxylated to [U-13C]pyruvate (PYR) catalyzed by malic enzyme (ME). Alternatively,
  [U-13C]oxaloacetate may be metabolized to pyruvate via [U-13C]phosphoenolpyruvate
  catalyzed by the concerted action of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and
  pyruvate kinase (PK). The carbons originating from glutamate can subsequently re-enter
  the TCA cycle by oxidative decarboxylation of [U-13C]pyruvate to [1,2-13C]acetyl
  CoA catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Unlabeled oxaloacetate may condense
  with [1,2-13C]acetyl CoA forming [1,2-13C]citrate (CIT). From metabolism in the
  TCA cycle [4,5-13C] α-ketoglutarate is formed and consequently [4,5-13C]glutamate
  due to the activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AAT). The symmetric succinate
  molecule causes scrambling of labeling and therefore both [1,2-13C] and [3,4-13C]
  oxaloacetate are formed. Oxaloacetate is in equilibrium with [1,2-13C] and [3,4-13C]aspartate
  due to the activity of aspartate aminotransferase. Alternative to oxidative decarboxylation
  of pyruvate, [U-13C]pyruvate may be converted to [U-13C]lactate (LAC) catalyzed
  by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).'
