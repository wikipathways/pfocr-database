caption: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (right) leads to activation of three branches
  of the UPR. (1) The inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1a) branch, (2) the PERK pathway,
  and (3) the ATF6 pathway. (1) Activation of IRE1a via dimerization and autophosphorylation
  leads to splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, which is then locally
  translated within dendrites and transported into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus,
  XBP1s activates the transcription of genes encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF), kalirin 7, and other functions involved in neuronal plasticity. BDNF can
  then localize extracellularly where it activates the TrkB receptor, resulting in
  activation of PKA and IRE1α/XBP1 signaling. Thus, a positive feedback loop maintains
  the activity of IRE1α/XBP1s pathway and promotes the expression of target genes
  involved in synaptic plasticity and memory. IRE1α also physically interacts with
  filamin A that regulates the development of the cerebral cortex. (2) Protein kinase
  R (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) is activated during ER stress. PERK phosphorylates
  (P) the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) which plays
  a key role in learning and memory. Phosphorylation of eIF2α leads to global attenuation
  of translation and selective expression of ATF4. Increased expression of ATF4 represses
  cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and inhibits the expression of genes
  involved in synaptic plasticity and memory. (3) ER stress can also activate the
  ATF6 pathway, but whether ATF6 signaling in the brain is involved in synaptic plasticity
  and memory processes is not known.
