caption: 'Summary of the effects of DA on synaptic integration. A, DA exerts two primary
  actions on summation of PSPs: (1) increase in summation (Σ) at depolarized membrane
  potentials (Vdepol) by enhancement of Na currents, and (2) reduction in summation
  near Vrest by enhancement of h-currents. B, Activation of DA D1 receptors reduced
  summation near Vrest by a pathway dependent on adenylyl cyclase and cAMP (). C,
  Activation of DA D2 receptors increased summation by a pathway dependent on PLC,
  internal Ca2+, and PP2B. Blockade of PKC exerted an opposing influence, consistent
  with a D2-mediated enhancement of summation through reduction in Na-channel phosphorylation
  (∼P), which increases Na-channel activity. This, however, does not rule out other
  ion channels or signaling molecules in the actions of DA. Our data indicate that
  these are the most prominent signaling cascades and ion channels involved in the
  DAergic actions under these conditions. In addition, although our data are consistent
  with D2-mediated modulation of dendritic excitability, it is possible that this
  does not occur via modulation of Na+ channels and does not rule out potential involvement
  of D1 receptors. Signaling molecules in bold lettering indicate evidence from the
  current study. Signaling molecules in italics represent evidence from a previous
  study (). Gray lettering indicates signaling molecules that are known to usually
  be in that signaling cascade but that were not examined in this study. AC, Adenylyl
  cyclase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum.'
