caption: 'Model describing the heterochromatin repair pathway in Drosophila and mouse
  cells. In Drosophila cells, DSBs are promptly recognized inside the heterochromatin
  domain, leading to resection by Mre11, CtIP, Exo1, Blm, and Dna2, and to activation
  of checkpoint kinases (particularly ATR) []. Resection and checkpoint activation
  promote heterochromatin expansion []. Smc5/6 (specifically its SUMO-E3 ligase subunits
  Nse2/ Qjt and Nse2/Cerv) and the SUMO-E3 ligase dPIAS, induce the block to HR progression
  and relocalization []. Myo1A, Myo1B and MyoV nuclear myosins and Arp2/3 actin nucleator
  are recruited to heterochromatic DSBs via HP1a and the MRN complex (Mre11-Rad50-Nse2)
  []. Scar or Wash-dependent Arp2/3 activation promotes nuclear actin filament assembly
  at repair sites [], with polymerization largely occurring at the periphery of the
  heterochromatin domain []. Unc45 recruitment by Smc5/6 activates nuclear myosins
  that ‘walk’ along the filaments and interact with Smc5/6, enabling directed motion
  of repair sites to the nuclear periphery [, , ]. STUbL/RENi protein complexes are
  associated with the nuclear periphery to promote DSB anchoring and repair progression
  [], likely via STUbL-dependent ubiquitination of SUMOylated targets and activation
  or degradation through the proteasome. HR progresses with Rad51 recruitment and
  strand invasion using the homologous chromosome or the sister chromatid [, ]. Similarly,
  in mouse G2 cells, heterochromatin expands in response to damage [, ], and Rad51
  is recruited after relocalization of repair sites to outside the chromocenters [,
  , ]. Relocalization requires resection, Smc5/6, Arp2/3, actin polymerization, and
  myosins’ ability to walk along actin filaments [, ]. INMPs: Inner Nuclear Membrane
