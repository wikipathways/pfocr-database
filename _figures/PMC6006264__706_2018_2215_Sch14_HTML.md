caption: Although citrate has relatively low affinity to Fe(III) [], it is used by
  E. coli as an exogenous siderophore []. Md-Saleh and coworkers prepared conjugates
  of ciprofloxacin with a monocitrate unit linked via stable amide bond on the piperazinyl
  ring. Methanoate ciprofloxacin esters were subjected to the reaction with citrates
  by EDCI-mediated coupling, then deprotected furnishing conjugates 26a and 26b in
  good yields (Scheme ). Anti-microbial activity of the obtained compounds was tested
  against several common pathogens, inter alia S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,
  P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia, and E. coli. The inhibition
  activity for both novel compounds was comparable to the clinic drug ciprofloxacin
  and, however, slightly lower for the majority of the strains tested. Compound 26b
  has been subjected to additional tests to explore its cell membrane permeability;
  however, the data showed that there was no additional uptake via an iron–citrate
  pathway and the conjugate was not recognized by Fec system [].
