caption: The schematic diagram of the reported mechanisms involved in IRE-induced
  immune responses. IRE increases the synthesis and secretion of damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), and the DC cells take up these DAMPs, migrate to draining
  lymph nodes, and then activate tumor antigen-specific T cells, and the activated
  T cells home to tumor sites to eliminate the residual tumor cells. The DAMPs activated
  the MAPK–p38 pathway by binding to RAGE, resulting in M1 macrophage polarization.
  IRE inhibited TSLP in the TME preventing Th2 polarization. Additionally, IRE softens
  the ECM, increases the density and permeability of tumor vessels, and facilitates
  the infiltration of immune cells into residual tumor tissues.
