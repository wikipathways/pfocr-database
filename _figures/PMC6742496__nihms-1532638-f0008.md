caption: EGFR amplification/ mutations, the most common growth factor receptor alternations
  in cancer (over 50% in GBMs), upregulates LPCAT1 and activates membrane lipid remodeling
  pathway in GBM. LPCAT1 itself was also found frequently amplified across cancers,
  including lung cancers, ovarian cancers, bladder cancers, and invasive breast cancers,
  with a DNA copy-number increase in about 30% TCGA reported pan-cancer patients.
  Significant co-occurrence of genomic alternations between LPCAT1 and genes in growth
  factor pathways was identified in TCGA pan-cancer datasets containing a total of
  10,967 patient samples from 33 cancer types. LPCAT1-mediated phospholipid remodeling
  further supports the sustained oncogenic activity of grow factor receptors on plasma
  membrane of tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, generating an actionable dependency
  across cancers.
