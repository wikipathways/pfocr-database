caption: Novel metabolic pathway for PHBV production from an unrelated carbon source.
  1, Sbm; 2, methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (YgfG); 3, 3-ketothiolase (PhaA); 4,
  acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB); 5, PHA synthase (PhaC); 6, 2-methylcitric acid
  synthase (PrpC). The citric acid cycle (left) and the 2-methylcitric acid cycle
  (right), which compete for acetyl-CoA and for propionyl-CoA, respectively, are shown.
  The 2-methylcitric acid cycle is blocked in the expression system described in this
  paper, as indicated. PHV, poly(3-hydroxyvalerate); PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.
