caption: BCR signaling pathway and BCR-associated CXCR4 signaling in CLL. Activated
  Src family kinases (SFKs), such as LYN, stimulate the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) located in the cytoplasmic Igα/Igβ signaling
  subunit of the BCR. This results in the recruitment and activation of SH2 domain-containing
  effectors, like SYK and ZAP-70, which phosphorylate BTK and CD19. SHP-1 inhibits
  the phosphorylation of the Igα ITAMs and SYK. Phosphorylated CD19 recruits the PI3K
  to the cell membrane, where it phosphorylates PIP2 to generate PIP3. Thereby, PI3K
  creates an essential docking platform for PH domain-containing signaling factors,
  such as PDK1, BTK and AKT. Binding to PIP3 results in membrane recruitment and activation
  of PDK1, BTK and AKT, which mediate the initiation of several BCR downstream signaling
  cascades, such as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, NFAT, NF-κB and mTORC1 signaling. The
  phosphatase PTEN represses PI3K signaling by PIP3 dephosphorylation, generating
  PIP2. NFAT is activated by increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations, which are
  induced by PLCγ. NF-κB is retained in an inactive state by the inhibitor IκB. Phosphorylation
  of IKK leads to IκBs phosphorylation and degradation, finally resulting in NF-κB
  activation. TSC1/2 inhibits RHEB GTPase activity, which is required to induce mTORC1
  activation. AKT- or ERK-mediated inhibition of TSC2, results in mTORC1 activation.
  In addition, binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4 induces CLL cell migration, survival and
  chemotaxis via the activation of the downstream signaling pathways MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT,
  PLCγ/Ca2+ and NF-κB. This figure was created with BioRender.com. BCR, B cell receptor;
