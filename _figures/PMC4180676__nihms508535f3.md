caption: Intracellular signaling mechanism triggered by CSPG present in the glial
  scar. CSPG receptors are thought to be present in axons although their molecular
  identity is not well established. Recent studies have shown that CSPG can interact
  with leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase, Nogo, or EGF receptors and lead
  to growth inhibition.(–) RhoA activation eventually leads to actin depolymerization
  and the growth cone retraction. RhoA activation has also been shown to be associated
  with PKC pathway and epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation (EGFR) in
  calcium dependent manner.(, ) However, the process of calcium influx leading to
  PKC activation or EGFR activation is not well defined. Dashed arrows suggest that
  mediators of the represented process are yet to be identified.
