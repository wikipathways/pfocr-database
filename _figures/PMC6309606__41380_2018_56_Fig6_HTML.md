caption: The RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT, WNT and β-catenin signaling pathways are involved
  in different stages of brain development and are commonly disrupted in ASD. The
  schematic on the left indicates that these signaling pathways are highly interconnected
  and modulate different aspects of brain development. For this illustration, the
  pathways are simplified and some intermediate genes are not shown. In the table
  on the right, a plus sign  (+) for each pathway indicates that its dysregulation
  has been reported in the corresponding fetal developmental stages based on studies
  on either hcASD genes, ASD-derived neurons, or both (double plus signs).
