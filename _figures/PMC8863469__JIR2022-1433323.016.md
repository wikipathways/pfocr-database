caption: A novel working model was proposed in our study. (1) M6A-RMRs differently
  expressed in acute inflammations, metabolic diseases, autoimmune diseases, organ
  failures, viral infections, and tumors. (2) Cellular mechanisms such as macrophage
  polarization, endothelial cell activation, CD4+Foxp3+regulatory T cell activation,
  and resting status, and pathophysiological changes of other cells regulate the transcriptomic
  changes of m6A-RMRs. (3) In folate cycle, transsulfuration pathway, glutathione
  synthesis, polyamine metabolism, and methionine salvage pathway, homocysteine-methionine
  cycle serves as a sensor-receptor system to sense the intracellular metabolic homeostasis
  and stresses of four amino acids such as methionine, homocysteine, serine, and arginine
  as well as vitamin B12 and folate. The metabolic homeostasis and stress signals
  relay the metabolic reprogramming signals into cellular methylation processes via
  various methyltransferases to methylate DNAs, proteins, histones, RNAs, and other
  molecules. (4) Cell surface receptors such as cytokine receptors, viral receptors,
  danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMPs) receptors/pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern (PAMPs) receptors, immune checkpoint receptors, and cosignaling receptors
  regulate the transcriptomic changes of m6A-RMRs. Nuclear transcription factors (TFs)
  including proinflammatory TFs NF-κB, Jak-STATs, tumor suppressors TP53, PTEN, and
  APC regulate the transcriptomic changes of m6A-RMRs. The figure was created with
