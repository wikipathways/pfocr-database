caption: Cell cycle regulation by Rad6. (A) Cell cycle entry is initiated by phosphorylation
  of Whi5 by Cln3-Cdc28, which leads to nuclear exclusion of Whi5 and activation of
  SBF. SBF activates the G1 transcriptional program, which includes the cyclins CLN1
  and CLN2, which in a positive feedback loop further phosphorylate and inhibit Whi5
  to induce efficient cell cycle entry. (B) Doa1 supplies ubiquitin to the pool of
  free ubiquitin. Rad6 forms a link between the pool of free ubiquitin and the cell
  cycle by promoting transcription of cyclins. (C) Cdc48 promotes cell cycle progression
  in at least two ways. It promotes degradation of Far1, presumably through its binding
  partners Ufd1 and Npl4. This relieves the inhibition of Cln-Cdc28 complexes, in
  particular when cells recover from pheromone-induced cell cycle arrest. In addition,
  Cdc48 promotes cell cycle progression by increasing the expression of cyclins through
  the Doa1-ubiqtuin-Rad6-Bre1 pathway.
