caption: IQGAP1 binds receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) like EGFR [] directly or indirectly
  to signal the formation of specialized scaffolds, which regulate cell homeostasis
  through dynamic phosphorylation [, , , ]. Deregulation of IQGAP1’s signal dynamics
  can tilt the IQGAP1-mTORC1-Akt1-MAPK pathway to the left or to the right (red arrows
  with multiple heads) [, , , ]. If tilted to the left via down regulation of IQGAP1
  and/or persistence of the un-phosphorylated form and deregulation of the MAPK signal,
  it leads to increased β-cell size [] and apoptosis and thus diabetes resulting from
  loss of β-cells, and explaining why IQGAP1 expression is down regulated in β-cells
  from a population of diabetic patients. If the pathway is tilted to the right via
  overexpression of IQGAP1 and/or persistence of the phospho-form and chronic Akt
  activity, it leads to transformed phenotypes [, ], leading to cancer initiation
  as well as diabetes, resulting from undifferentiated β-cells. Therefore, the nature
  of the deregulation in the pathway defines different subsets of patients and might
  be useful for developing personalized medicine.
