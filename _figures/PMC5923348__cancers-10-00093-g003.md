caption: The intricate relationship between CD30 and AP-1 in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma
  (CHL) and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (ALCL). (A) Cell surface protein signalling
  involved in CHL. In CHL, the PD-L1 enhancer binds AP-1 TFs resulting in an increase
  in PD-L1 promoter activity. Similarly, binding of P-Selectin (green) to CD15 (Lewis
  X) induces the translocation of c-JUN into the nucleus and an increase in AP-1 DNA
  binding activity. CD30 activation, mediated via CD30-ligand (CD30-L) (purple), results
  in the formation of a homo-trimer. The receptor, which lacks a kinase domain, recruits
  TNFR-associated factors (TRAF), which activate NF-κB and MAPK/ERK downstream signalling
  pathways. The activation of NF-κB and MAPK/ERK results in the phosphorylation of
  AP-1 and STAT TFs. Following activation, JUNB translocates to the nucleus where
  it binds to the unmethylated CD30 promoter and maintains elevated CD30 levels; (B)
  In ALCL, Nucleophosmin-Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (NPM–ALK) controls CD30 expression
  via the phosphorylation of downstream targets, such as STAT and AP-1. Once activated,
  the STATs and AP-1 complexes cooperate to enhance CD30 transcription, fuelling a
  positive feedback loop. Thus, when activated in ALCL, CD30 stimulates the activation
  of both the canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways in addition to indirectly stimulating
  its upregulation. Additionally, NPM–ALK is believed to upregulate PD-L1 directly
  via phosphorylation of STAT and AP-1 TFs, or indirectly via the induction of interleukin-10
  (IL-10), which in turn is known to activate the JAK/STAT signalling pathway.
