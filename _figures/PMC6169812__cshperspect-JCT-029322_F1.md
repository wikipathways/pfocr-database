caption: New interactors of endothelial adherens junctions (AJs). Recently described
  interactors of VE-cadherin complexes and their functions in nascent (A) and stabilized
  (B) endothelial AJs are represented as discussed in the text. In addition, in (A),
  the binding of EGF receptor kinase substrate 8 (EPS8) to the AJ complex is shown
  to inhibit the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (protein kinase B) pathway,
  thus increasing VE-cadherin turnover at AJs () and maintaining dynamic AJs. Conversely,
  in stabilized AJs (B), the active PI3K/AKT pathway induces phosphorylation and cytoplasmic
  localization of the Yes-associated protein (YAP), which localizes to junctions and
  contributes to enhanced barrier function. As discussed in the text and shown in
  B, Rasip1 is required during stabilization of cell–cell contacts, but it is not
  necessary for their maintenance. The representation of the VE-cadherin domains interacting
  in trans (EC1-EC1) and in cis (EC1-EC2) are according to  and .
