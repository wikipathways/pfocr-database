caption: 'The role of nitric oxide as a regulator of mitochondrial function, metabolism
  and the hypoxia response. The wide range of functions controlled by nitric oxide
  (NO) is a consequence of its dose-dependent dual roles. Physiological concentrations
  of NO inhibit cytochrome c oxidase in a reversible manner in competition with O2.
  This interaction depends on NO and oxygen concentrations and the redox state of
  the enzyme. Because of this, it has been reported that NO might be a regulator of
  cell respiration, modulating metabolic changes responsible for an increase in glycolytic
  pathway flux to maintain energy homeostasis. On the other hand, NO can also regulate
  the hypoxia response through hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In a normoxic
  microenvironment, NO induces HIF-1α accumulation in a mitochondrial-dependent and
  -independent manner. Hypoxia conditions promote delayed cell differentiation. These
  facts indicate that NO might maintain pluripotency via regulation of metabolism
  and the hypoxia response. EM: Energy metabolism.'
