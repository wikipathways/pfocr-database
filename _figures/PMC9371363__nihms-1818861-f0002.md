caption: IL-13 and IL-4 signaling intermediates and receptors are marked in black
  and grey. Negative regulators (marked in red circles and red lines) of IL-4/13 signaling
  (SOCS proteins, protein tyrosine phosphatases) function by inhibiting JAK kinase
  activity, targeting activated signaling intermediates for proteolysis, and removing
  phosphate groups from activated signaling intermediates. Positive regulators (marked
  in green circles and green arrows) of IL-4/13 signaling pathway (PARP proteins,
  cAMP, S1P2 and IL-17A) facilitate efficient STAT6 DNA binding, protect STAT6 from
  proteolytic degradation, enhance STAT6 phosphorylation, enhance IL-4-induced gene
  expression through recruitment of C/EBPβ, and suppress SOCS3-mediated inhibition.
