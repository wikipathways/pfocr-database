caption: Quantitatively elevated and depleted metabolites are shown in red and blue,
  respectively, while grey metabolites indicate no change or not measured in this
  study. Possible chemical modification of DNA contributing to production of these
  metabolites is shown with red bases indicating base modification (such as C→U) and
  red boxes indicating nucleotide excision sites following single-strand breaks. The
  enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways such as cytidine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.5),
  thymidine kinase (EC 2.7.1.21), thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45), 5',3'-nucleotidase
  (mitochondrial) (EC 3.1.3.5), purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1), guanine
  deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4), adenine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.3), xanthine dehydrogenase (EC
  1.17.3.2), xanthine oxidase (EC 1.17.1.4), ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.17),
  spermidine synthase (EC 2.5.1.16) and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (EC
  2.3.1.57) are indicated next to corresponding steps (shown by solid grey arrow).
  Lines with arrows in both directions for purine-nucleoside phosphorylase indicate
  its ability to catalyze ribosyltransferase activity in both directions. Dotted grey
  arrow indicates that the corresponding enzymatic activity has not been reported
  in mice. (C) Putative mechanism showing the role of polyamine catabolism in radiation-induced
  damage-repair through cell cycle arrest and the effect of aging in the process.
  Dark red asterisk indicate DNA damage lesion caused by radiation exposure that would
  cause mutation if replicated without repair during proliferation. Faint red asterisk
  encircled by black circles indicate recruitment of DNA-damage repair machinery during
  cell cycle arrest leading to successful DNA damage repair. Attenuation of polyamine
  catabolism in older mice may lead to inefficient arrest of cell cycle and, thus,
  impairment of DNA damage repair and propagation of mutation in proliferating somatic
  cells.
