caption: Schematic of IL-6 trans-signaling pathway involvement in lung cell apoptosis
  and emphysema-like disease. Ruwanpura and colleagues () have demonstrated that inhibitors
  of IL-6 trans-signaling ameliorate apoptosis and emphysema-like phenotype induced
  by either cigarette smoke or by transgenic overexpression of gp130. These effects
  were associated with increased mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1)
  signaling and were inhibited by rapamycin. ATII = alveolar type II cells; MGK = megakaryocytes;
  sIL-6R = soluble IL-6 receptor; sgp130 = soluble gp130; TACE = ADAM 17.
