caption: Potential molecular events associated with tumor suppressor gene product-induced
  senescence or apoptotic cell death of tissue-resident stem/progenitor cells during
  chronological aging. The up-regulated expression of p16INK4A tumor suppressor protein
  may lead to an inhibition of the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4/6-cyclin
  D complex, whose event in turn may impair the phosphorylation of pRb. The maintainance
  of the pRb tumor suppressor protein under its hypophosphorylated state and its interaction
  with the E2F transcription factor may prevent the release of E2F and repress the
  free E2F-induced gene products resulting in blocking G1/S cell cycle progression,
  a growth arrest and senescence of aged adult stem/progenitor cells. Additionally,
  the activation of p53 tumor suppressor protein-dependent pathways induced in response
  to genotoxic stress and DNA damages, which may be mediated via the stimulation of
  the p19ARF protein or ATM serine/threonine kinase, may also promote a cell cycle
  arrest, growth inhibition and acquisition of a senescent state by up-regulating
  CDK inhibitor, p21CIP1/WAP1 and down-regulating pRb/E2F axis. Particularly, an enhanced
  expression of the p19ARF protein may inhibit an ubiquitin ligase (E3), human double
  minute 2 (HDM2), and thereby prevent the formation of HDM2-p53 complex, p53 ubiquitination,
  nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of HDM2-p53 complex and proteasome-induced p53 degradation.
  Moreover, an inhibition of the growth factor-induced PI3K/Akt or PKB signaling pathway
  by PTEN may also lead to an inhibition of the nuclear export of FOXO transcription
  factors. Hence, nuclear FOXOs may induce an enhanced expression of p19ARF and cycle
  cycle inhibitors such as p27KIP1 and p57KIP2 and growth inhibition. Alternatively,
  p53 transcription factor may also stimulate the expression of pro-apoptotic factors
  such as mitochondrial Bax protein, whose molecular event in turn may result in the
  caspase activation and apoptotic death of aged stem/progenitor cells.
