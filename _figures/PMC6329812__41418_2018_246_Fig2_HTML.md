caption: The stress adaptive processes induced by mutant p53 trigger positive loops
  feeding its own accumulation in cancer cells. In tumor cells, the Heat-shock protein
  (Hsp) chaperone machinery (comprising Hsp90, Hsp70, and Hsp40/DNAJA1) promotes mutp53
  stabilization by inhibiting the ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and CHIP; mutant p53 can
  further enhance this mechanism by different means. In breast cancer cells, mutp53
  was shown to induce the mevalonate pathway in concert with SREBP [], thereby producing
  M5P that promotes interaction of mutp53 with Hsp40/DNAJA1 [], as well as GGPP that
  stimulates RhoA activation and cancer cell mechano-responsiveness. In multiple tumor-derived
  cell lines, mutp53 was shown to promote RhoA activation also by inducing its positive
  regulators GEF-H1 [] and RhoGDI []. Mechano-transduction activates the Hsp90 cofactor
  HDAC6, and this was shown to boost mutp53 stabilization in breast cancer cell lines
  and tumor xenografts []. Finally, in human and mouse breast cancer cell lines, mutp53
  was shown to directly upregulate Hsp90/Hsp70 expression by stimulating HSF1 activity
  []. Besides the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, mutp53 is degraded by autophagy-mediated
  proteolysis upon glucose deprivation []; in breast cancer models, mutp53 was shown
  to counteract the autophagic process []. Moreover, in various human cancer cell
  lines and in mutp53 knock-in mice, mutp53 was shown to increase intracellular glucose
  levels by stimulating RhoA-dependent membrane translocation of the Glut1 transporter
  []. M5P mevalonate-5-phosphate; GGPP geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate
