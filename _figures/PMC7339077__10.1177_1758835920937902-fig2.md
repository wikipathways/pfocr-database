caption: Biomarkers of primary and acquired resistance occurring in the (A) tumor
  microenvironment (TME), (B) in the tumor, and (C) host factors. Within the TME,
  factors involved in primary resistance (blue font) includes the presence of (a)
  immunosuppressive cells including cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), myeloid
  derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (T reg), M2 macrophages, and
  reduced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), (b) immune-suppressive molecules
  such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), adenosine, vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF), glucose, and (c) tumoral factors such as reduced PD-L1 expression,
  tumor mutation burden (TMB), intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH), genetic loss of
  HLA class I, dysregulated IFN/JAK pathway, aberrant oncologic signaling pathways
  (PTEN loss, mutations in WNT/b-catenin, LKB1, c-myc). Biomarkers associated with
  acquired resistance (red font) include (d) loss of B2m and MHC-I, neoantigen evolution
  with loss of neoepitopes; the IFN/JAK escape pathway with loss of function JAK-1
  and JAK-2 mutations and (e) the upregulation of other immune checkpoints such as
  T-cell immunoglobulin, mucin domain-3 protein (TIM-3), lymphocyte-activation gene
  3 (LAG-3), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), T-cell immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  inhibition motif domain (TIGIT), and V-domain immunoglobulin-containing suppressor
  of T-cell activation (VISTA). Host factors affecting resistance includes (e) gut
  microbiome and antibiotic use.
