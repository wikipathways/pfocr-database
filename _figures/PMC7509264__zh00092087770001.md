caption: Proposed pathway of IL-19 resolution of inflammation in immune cells. IL-19
  receptor engagement activates STAT3, which mediates anti-inflammatory signaling.
  Inflammatory gene expression is reduced, leading to T helper 2 (Th2) polarization
  in lymphocytes, and M2 polarization in macrophages.
