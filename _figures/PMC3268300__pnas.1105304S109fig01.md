caption: The c-MYC/SIRT1 feedback loop (gray) is in place in normal (green) and tumor
  (orange) cells. However, in normal cells, c-MYC expression is under stringent control
  by nutrient and growth factor availability and antimitogenic factors, which may
  shut off the feedback loop. In tumor and cancer cells, c-MYC expression is often
  constitutive and/or up-regulated as a result of alterations in the c-MYC gene or
  mutation of upstream regulators as components of the wnt/APC/β-catenin pathway.
  Therefore, the feedback loop is permanently on. p53 and X represent SIRT1-substrates
  with pro-cell death and prosenescence activities, which are subject to inactivation
  by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation. In the case of p53 this leads to reduced expression
  of the p53-target genes PUMA and p21, which contributes to enhanced survival and
  proliferation, respectively. Double colons indicate protein–protein interactions.

  the SIRT1 deacetylase form a positive feedback loop.
