caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed mechanism by which AHE-EA-C exerts
  its anti-leukemic effects in AML cells. The T-shaped arrows represent inhibition,
  while the pointed arrows indicate activation or stimulation. Green-labeled proteins
  (CDK4, Cyclin D1) are associated with cell cycle regulation, and blue-labeled proteins
  (Bcl-2, Cl-PARP, Cl-caspase 3) are associated with apoptosis. AHE-EA-C treatment
  inhibits the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
  Specifically, AHE-EA-C downregulates the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, reducing
  the expression of cell cycle regulators CDK4 and Cyclin D1, which results in G1
  phase arrest. Additionally, AHE-EA-C decreases the expression of the anti-apoptotic
  protein Bcl-2 while increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax.
  This shift in the apoptotic balance leads to the activation of cleaved caspase-3
  (Cl-Caspase-3) and the cleavage of PARP (Cl-PARP), ultimately inducing apoptosis
