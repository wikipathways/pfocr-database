caption: 'Mode of TCM action in a course of COVID-19 treatment. Blue arrows: Chinese
  medicines (CMs) might directly inhibit SRAS-CoV-2 adsorption and replication by
  interfering with virus’ binding to ACE2 and 3CL pro. CMs can also indirectly protect
  target organs by inhibiting the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, regulating the balance
  of ACE2 in the body through the Ang/Mas pathway. Red arrows: CMs might reduce the
  production of inflammatory mediators, protect target organs, and relieve the deterioration
  caused by COVID-19 by anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects through affecting
  the Ang/AT1R pathway. Yellow arrows: CMs might play an anti-inflammatory and immune
  regulatory role to prevent cytokine storm. Purple arrows: CMs also have an expectorant
  effect for relieving airway obstruction.'
