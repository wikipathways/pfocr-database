caption: The roles of TLR signaling in glial cells, endothelial cells, leukocytes
  and neuronal cells during the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. During ischemic stroke,
  TLRs are activated and induce NFκB activation in glial cells, endothelial cells
  and infiltrating lymphocytes. In neurons, the JNK/AP-1 pathway is activated. This
  culminates in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines secretion, nitric oxide synthase
  and cox-2 expression induction. Endothelial cells dysfunction causes blood-brain-barrier
  permeability which promotes further lipid peroxidation, apoptosis of neurons, infarct
  and neurological deficits as the final outcome.
