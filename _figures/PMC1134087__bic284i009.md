caption: The drug enters the cell through a BLM transporter. The activity of the transporter
  might be influenced by the kinases Ptk2 and Sky1, which are known to regulate the
  plasma membrane polyamine transporter (see text). After uptake, BLM is channelled
  to the vacuole for detoxification. Interruption of the endocytic pathway to the
  vacuoles resulted in mutants that are hypersensitive to BLM.
