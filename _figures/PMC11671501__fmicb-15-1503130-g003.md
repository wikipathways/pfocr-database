caption: Apoptotic caspase-mediated pyroptosis. This diagram illustrates the apoptotic
  signaling pathway, which can also lead to pyroptosis. The process is initiated by
  the binding of death ligands (such as TNF-α, FasL, or TRAIL) to their respective
  receptors (TNFR, Fas), triggering the activation of Caspase-8. In response to cellular
  stress, such as DNA damage or cytokine deprivation, BH3-only proteins are activated,
  which in turn modulate anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2. The activation of Caspase-8
  leads to the cleavage of Bid, generating tBid, which translocates to the mitochondria
  and interacts with Bax/Bak, facilitating the release of Cyt C from the mitochondria.
  This activation leads to the formation of the Apoptosome, which activates Caspase-9,
  and subsequently Caspase-3. Caspase-3 cleaves GSDME, releasing its active N-terminal
  fragment (GSDME-N), which forms pores in the cell membrane, ultimately resulting
  in pyroptosis. Additionally, in this pathway, PARP cleavage is also a key event
  in apoptosis, with its activation promoting cellular disassembly. Pyroptosis, as
  an inflammatory form of cell death, results from caspase activation, which causes
  the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the rupture of the cell membrane
