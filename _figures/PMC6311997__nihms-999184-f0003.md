caption: 'Diagrams of two p53 signaling pathways with feedback loops added to the
  original pathway. (a) The NPF model contains an extra positive feedback loop: p53
  promotes PFM (positive feedback mediator) production, which in turn promotes p53
  production. Adapted from ref. . (b) The 2NF model contains an extra negative feedback
  loop: p53 promotes NFM (negative feedback mediator) production, which in turn inhibits
  p53 production. Adapted from ref. . (c) The detailed diagram of the NPF model includes
  one extra part (PFM) and three extra processes: p53-upregulated PFM production,
  PFM degradation, and PFM-upregulated p53 production. (d) The detailed diagram of
  the 2NF model is similar to that of the NPF model except that NFM inhibits rather
  than promotes p53 production'
