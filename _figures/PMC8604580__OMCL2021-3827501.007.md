caption: Lidocaine-induced inflammation tolerance alleviates LPS-induced acute lung
  injury. LPS leads to upregulation of tissue factor (TF) and MMP-2/9 via the TLR4-ASK1-p38
  signaling pathway and results in endothelial injury, a hypercoagulable state in
  the blood vessels, and robust inflammatory infiltration in the lung. Lidocaine pretreatment
  activates AMPK/SOCS3 axis, which induces inflammatory tolerance and alleviates acute
  lung injury in mice.
