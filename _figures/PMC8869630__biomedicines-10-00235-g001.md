caption: 'Summary of type I IFN response induction by poxviruses and its inhibition
  by VACV E3 protein. During poxviral infection, transcription of the viral genome
  results in the production of dsRNA and Z-RNA. Furthermore, dsRNA is sensed by cytosolic
  sensors RIG-I/MDA5 and cGAS, which induce a signaling cascade leading to the production
  of proinflammatory cytokines and type I IFN. IFN is sensed by neighboring cells,
  where it induces the expression of ISGs, including OAS, PKR, and ZBP1. Activation
  of OAS and PKR by dsRNA leads to RNA degradation and inhibition of translation,
  respectively. Activation of ZBP1 by Z-RNA results in induction of cellular death
  pathway necroptosis. The VACV E3 protein binds to dsRNA and thereby inhibits its
  recognition by RIG-I/MDA5 and cGAS (red text and red lines). E3 also inhibits activation
  of OAS and PKR by binding to dsRNA, and inhibits activation of ZBP1 by binding to
  zRNA. Abbreviations used in this figure include: eIF2α: eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2 subunit alpha; IFN: interferon; IFNAR1/2: IFN alpha and beta receptor subunit
  1/2; IκBα: NFκB inhibitor alpha; IKKα/β/ε: IκBα kinase alpha/beta/epsilon; IRF3/7/9:
  interferon regulatory factor 3/7/9; ISG: IFN-stimulated gene; ISRE: IFN-sensitive
