caption: The exogenous pathway is a process for delivering triglycerides to peripheral
  tissues using chylomicrons and VLDLs. Chylomicron particles, consisting of APOB-48
  and various other proteins, are formed by enterocytes, released into the lymph,
  and eventually enter the bloodstream. In peripheral tissues, chylomicron triglycerides
  are broken down, and the remnants are taken up by the liver, while APOA and APOC
  return to HDL. In the endogenous pathway, the liver produces triglycerides carried
  to peripheral tissues by VLDL. These VLDL particles initially contain APOB100 and
  acquire additional proteins and cholesteryl esters from HDL. In peripheral tissues,
  VLDL triglycerides are partially broken down into VLDL remnants, which are either
  absorbed by the liver or converted into LDL
