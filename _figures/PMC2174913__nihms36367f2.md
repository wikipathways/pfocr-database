caption: Checkpoints activated upon rereplication. Multiple rounds of replication
  could give rise to replication origins within replication bubbles which would activate
  ATR-dependent signaling pathways. Replication fork collision could generate DNA
  double strand breaks and activate ATM-dependent pathways. Orange stars denote proteins
  essential for checkpoint activation in response to rereplication. The pink dashed
  line denotes a hypothetical pathway. The 9-1-1 complex is composed of Rad9-Rad1-Hus1.
  The MRN complex is made up of Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1.
