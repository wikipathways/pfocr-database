caption: Ubiquitin-mediated IKK activation and Bcl10 autophagy in the T cell signaling
  pathway. The binding of the TCR to the antigen peptide presented by MHC molecules
  (p-MHC) induces T cell activation and leads to the initiation of a T cell response.
  When TCR:pMHC binding occurs, the TCR complex is phosphorylated by Lck. Phosphorylated
  signaling motifs in the TCR complex recruit the ZAP70 kinase. The recruitment of
  ZAP70 and its phosphorylation by Lck causes its activation. ZAP70 then phosphorylates
  the adaptor protein LAT, which recruits additional signaling effectors that become
  activated, leading to PKCθ activation. The activated PKCθ phosphorylates CARMA1
  in the CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex, inducing K63-linked or linear ubiquitination
  of Bcl10, which in turn binds to NEMO in the IKK complex. The formation of supercomplexes
  leads to liquid phase separation, which is presented as punctate cytosolic structures
  called POLKADOTS under a microscope [104]. The liquid phase separation and ubiquitin-mediated
  NEMO conformational changes induce IKKβ activation that triggers IκB phosphorylation,
  ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation, then NF-κB activation. Subsequently,
  the complexes encompassing ubiquitinated Bcl10 undergo autophagy that leads to Bcl10
  lysosomal degradation and the inhibition of T cell signaling-induced NF-κB and MAPK
  activation
