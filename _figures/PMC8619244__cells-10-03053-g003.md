caption: Schematic showing possible mechanisms by which TRP channels (other than TRPV4)
  regulate fibroblast differentiation. TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPM7 have been implicated
  in fibroblast (atrial and ventricular) differentiation. TGF-β shown to influence
  the expression/activity of these three TRP channels. TRPC3 signaling demonstrated
  to be critical for atrial fibroblast proliferation, migration, and fibrosis. The
  possible signaling mechanism appears to be AngII/AT1R/TGF-β1 mediated increase in
  TRPC3 expression via NFAT dependent downregulation of miR-26, which in turn activates
  fibroblast proliferation through ERK1/2. TGF-β was also shown to increase the expression
  of TRPC6 channels via p38/SRF and then calcium influx from TRPC6 induces fibroblast
  differentiation through CnA/NFAT signaling. TRPM7 shown to regulate mechanical stretch-induced
  fibroblast differentiation (atrial and adventitial) though p38 MAPK/JNK pathway.
  Ang II, angiotensin II; CnA, calcineurin; miR-26, microRNA26; NFAT, Nuclear factor
  of activated T-cells; ROCK, Rho associated protein kinase; SRF, serum responsive
  factor; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β.
