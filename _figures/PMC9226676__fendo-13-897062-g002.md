caption: Proposed Model of Regulation of Germ Cell Homeostasis by NOTCH Signaling.
  (A) Regulation of GDNF expression in Sertoli cells. GDNF is produced by Sertoli
  cells and normally increases Asingle, Apaired and some Aligned spermatogonia proliferation.
  However, as the number of undifferentiated spermatogonia increases, more JAG1 ligand
  is available to activate NOTCH signaling in Sertoli cells. Activated NOTCH will
  down-regulate the expression of GDNF through HES/HEY, which will decrease the number
  of undifferentiated spermatogonia, re-establishing GDNF production. Inhibition of
  GDNF by HES/HEY can be potentiated by the TNF-alpha/NF-KappaB pathway. (B) Regulation
  of CYP26B1 expression in Sertoli cells. CYP2681 is produced by Sertoli cells and
  normally degrades retinoic acid. However, as the number of undifferentiated spermatogonia
  increases, in particular Aaligned spermatogonia, more JAG1 ligand is available to
  activate NOTCH signaling in Sertoli cells. Activated NOTCH will down-regulate the
  expression of CYP26B1, which a llows retinoic acid to trigger the transition from
  undifferentiated to differentiating spermatogonia.
