caption: A simplified model of the differential effects of the doxorubicin–transferrin
  (DOX–Tf) conjugate on the pro-inflammatory response and induction of apoptosis via
  the extrinsic pathway. DOX–Tf conjugate stimulates the production of TNF-α and TRAIL
  ligand, the cell signaling proteins. They are also known as two major extrinsic
  mediators of apoptosis. Acute lymphoblastic cells and chronic myeloid malignancies
  have different isoreceptors for these cytokines. Binding of TRAIL or TNF-α to their
  receptors, results in death receptors aggregation (DR4, DR5) and Fas-associated
  death domain-containing protein (FADD). The death domain of FADD binds to an analogous
  domain of caspase-8 to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). This process
  activates downstream caspases and leads to apoptosis. In parallel, in the presence
  of typical hallmarks of apoptosis, the DOX–Tf conjugate affects cellular genome
  and mediates the production of pro-inflammatory response. The transcription of IL-4
  and IL-6 genes mediates the secretion of these cytokines to the extracellular matrix.
