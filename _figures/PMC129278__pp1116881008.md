caption: Model for disease resistance signal transduction. The dashed line leading
  from avr/R gene-dependent primary signal to reactive oxygen production is meant
  to indicate that this pathway is quantitatively much less significant than the cell
  death-induced reactive oxygen production. SA potentiation of cell death is represented
  with a symbol for a rheostat. Although pictured as being distinct, “triggering factor”
  could be nitric oxide, reactive oxygen, both, or something different. The SA-dependent
  negative feedback loop's precise target is not known. NDR1-independent pathways
  for SA production discussed in the text are not pictured.
