caption: Mitochondrial mitophagy processes. The damaged mitochondria with membrane
  depolarization initiate OMM protein ubiquitylation at the first stage of mitophagy.
  Then, the IMM protein PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1 (PINK1) is accumulated
  and translocated to OMM, and the damaged mitochondria with membrane depolarization
  initiate OMM protein ubiquitylation at the first stage of mitophagy. Then, the IMM
  protein PINK1 is accumulated as a functional full-length form and is translocated
  to OMM where it triggers the mitophagy pathways through recruiting the E3 ligase
  Parkin. The amplified ubiquitin signals on the impaired mitochondria subsequently
  recruit mitophagy adaptors (OPTIN, NBR1, BNIP3, NIX, NDP52, and p62/SQSTM1), which
  bind to autophagy core units and facilitate the synthesis of autophagosomes. The
  following processes of engulfing mitochondria are regulated by more than 30 kinds
  of Atg. The last stage of mitophagy is the autophagosome-lysosome fusion that is
  modulated by the Atg8 family, consisting of LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies. Apart from
  the archetypical PINK1/Parkin pathway, BNIP3L/NIX, FUNDC1, AMBRA1, and the lipid
  receptor Cardiolipin is also involved in mitophagy where it triggers the mitophagy
  pathways through recruiting the E3 ligase Parkin. The amplified ubiquitin signals
  on the impaired mitochondria subsequently recruit mitophagy adaptors (OPTIN, NBR1,
  BNIP3, NIX, NDP52, and p62/SQSTM1), which bind to autophagy core units to facilitate
  the synthesis of autophagosomes. The following processes of engulfing mitochondria
  are regulated by more than 30 kinds of autophagy-related proteins (Atg). The last
  stage of mitophagy is the autophagosome-lysosome fusion that is modulated by the
  Atg8 family, consisting of LC3 and GABARAP subfamilies. Apart from the archetypical
  PINK1/Parkin pathway, BNIP3L/NIX, FUNDC1, AMBRA1, and the lipid receptor cardiolipin
  are also involved in mitophagy.
