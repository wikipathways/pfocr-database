caption: 'Central Metabolism probed by hyperpolarized 13C enriched precursors. Metabolites
  in red have been 13C hyperpolarized at one or more atoms, and those in italics have
  been observed as products of hyperpolarized substrates via different pathways. These
  include glucose (Glc) oxidation to pyruvate (Pyr) via glycolysis, subsequent pyruvate
  metabolism via the Krebs cycle and lactic fermentation, anaplerosis via pyruvate
  carboxylation to oxaloacetate (OAA), and glucose metabolism via the pentose phosphate
  pathway from glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) to ribulose-5-phosphate
  (Ru5P). Also shown are anaplerosis via glutaminolysis or Gln conversion to Glu and
  then to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) for entry into the Krebs cycle and ethanol oxidation
  to acetate via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). DHAP:
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; 3PGA: 3-phosphoglycerate;
  PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate; Lac: lactate, Succ succinate; DES: diethylsuccinate; fum:
  fumarate; mal: malate; HK: hexokinase; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase; ALT: alanine
  pyruvate aminotransferase; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; SDH: succinate dehydrogenase;
