caption: Main branches of the kynurenine pathway. Each box represents a metabolite
  resulting from the oxidation of tryptophan. Putative neurotoxic metabolites are
  colored red whereas KA, which is putatively neuroprotective, is colored green. The
  black italicized text shows the enzymes that catalyze each step in the metabolic
  pathway. The blue and red stars indicate that the metabolite is able to cross the
  blood–brain barrier. The effects on NMDA receptor activity listed for some metabolites
  have been established in vitro, but the extent to which the metabolite concentrations
  achieve sufficiently high levels in vivo to impact the function of this receptor
  system remains unclear. NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor. A full text
  version of this figure is available at Neuropsychopharmacology Journal online.
