caption: (A) ROS-induced cellular signalling in cancer cells. Non-toxic levels of
  ROS induce the phosphorylation and activation of PI3P/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 and the
  simultaneous inactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) and lipid phosphatase,
  resulting in the inhibition of proapoptotic genes and the stimulation of cell growth
  and survival. ROS also activates the PDK1/NF-kB signalling pathway, leading to survival
  and proliferation. In contrast, overproduction of ROS leads to toxic oxidative stress,
  which activates Bak (Bcl-2 homologue antagonist/killer) and Bax (Bcl-2-associated
  X protein), which are pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family that regulate
  apoptosis and in particular the intrinsic (mitochrondrial) apoptosis pathway. Bax
  and Bak form pores in the outer mitochrondrial membrane that allow the release of
  cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. Cytochrome c induces the formation of the apoptosome,
  which activates caspase 9, which in turn activates executioner caspases 3 and 7;
  (B) PTPs and PTEN have a Cys residue in the active site in a thiolate state, which
  is susceptible to oxidation. The thiolate can be oxidised to sulfenate (-SOH), sulfinate
  (-SO2H) or sulfonate (-SO3H) depending on the H2O2 concentration. The Cys in the
  active site can also form disulfides, either with GSH, a reaction catalysed by GSTP1,
  or with another thiol in the active site, forming a disulphide bridge. These oxidative
  modifications inactivate the phosphatases and thereby enhance the MAPK/ERK and PKB/AKT
  pathways. The oxidative inactivation to sulfenate or sulfinate can be reversed by
  the antioxidant systems TXN1 or SRXN1. This restores phosphatase activity and promotes
  suppression of the MAPK/ERK and PKB/AKT signalling pathways. Similarly, Cys in the
  active site that have formed S-glutathionylation or have formed a disulfide bridge
  can be reversed by the enzyme glutaredoxin (GRX) (catalyses the reversible reduction
  of glutathione-protein mixed disulfide) or the TRX system. The oxidation of Cys
  in the active centre to a sulfonate state is irreversible (right) and the altered
  protein is degraded
