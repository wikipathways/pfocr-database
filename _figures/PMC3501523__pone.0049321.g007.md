caption: Association of TG2 with IκBα results in its rapid degradation via non-proteasomal
  pathway and liberates the p65/RelA:p50 NF-κB complex. TG2 also associates in complex
  with the p65/RealA subunit of NF-κB and translocates to the nucleus where it binds
  to the cognate NF-κB binding site on the HIF-1α promoter and results in its transcription
  regulation. Increased expression of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions results in
  increased expression of various downstream target genes such as transcription repressors
  Zeb1, Zeb2, Snail1 and Twist, which induce EMT and promote cell survival, invasiveness,
  and cellular plasticity. Overall, these TG2-regulated changes contribute to increased
  chemoresistance and metastatic potential.
