caption: 'Willin/FRMD6 in physiological conditions and associated molecular mechanisms.
  Willin/FRMD6 has been implicated in multiple aspects of neuronal function and is
  associated with several signaling pathways. (A) Neuronal functions of Willin/FRMD6
  in physiological conditions. (i) Willin/FRMD6 expression is significantly downregulated
  after mouse peripheral nerve injury by axotomy, indicating a role for Willin/FRMD6
  in nerve regeneration. (ii) Willin/FRMD6 silencing leads to increased myelin internodal
  length in mouse Schwann cells. (iii) Reduction of Willin/FRMD6 promotes neurite
  growth in SH-SY5Y cells; however, whether Willin/FRMD6 functions similarly in neurons
  remains to be explored. (B) Willin/FRMD6 interconnects with several neuronal differentiation
  associated signaling pathways. (iv) Willin/FRMD6 knockdown primes SH-SY5Y cells
  for RA-induced differentiation. Knockdown of Willin/FRMD6 leads to phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 in SH-SY5Y cells, indicating activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway
  (also termed the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway). In cardiac microvascular endothelial
  cells, Willin/FRMD6 functions as a downstream effector of BDNF–TrkB-T1 signaling,
  connecting TrkB-T1 to Hippo signaling. (v) Willin/FRMD6 is an upstream regulator
  of the Hippo signaling pathway. Canonical Hippo pathway activation involves the
  phosphorylation of the core Hippo kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2, resulting in phosphorylation
  and cytoplasmic sequestration/degradation of terminal effectors YAP/TAZ. In the
  nucleus, YAP/TAZ bind TEAD transcription factors and initiate pro-survival gene
  expression. Willin/FRMD6 also interacts with polarity proteins, such as Crb and
  Par3. (vi) Willin/FRMD6 directly binds to polarity regulator Par3 protein which
  resides within the PAR/PI3K signaling pathway in epithelial MDCK cells. In neurons,
  PI3K mediates the production of PIP3 which activates RAP1B and Cdc42 to accumulate
  at tips of growing axons. The continuously active positive signaling feedback loop
  can promote rapid growth of axons. Activation of Rho signaling and activation of
  ROCK can lead to changes in the organization of actin stress fibers. Abbreviations:
