caption: The figure depicts the role of various costimulatory molecules in the activation
  of na誰ve and differentiated T cells. Na誰ve T cells and Th1 cells rely heavily on
  CD28 and CD40L engagement to expand and differentiate. The ICOS/ICOSL pathway works
  on activated T cells with an especially potent signal to promote Th2 development.
  The activated T helper cell subsets finally promote different ranges of cellular
  and humoral immune responses.
