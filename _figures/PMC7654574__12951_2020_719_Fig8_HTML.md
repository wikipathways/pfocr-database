caption: Protein–protein interaction networks of energy metabolism canonical pathways
  affected by AgNPs/CDDP exposure in HepG2 and THLE2 cells. We built functional interaction
  networks of deregulated proteins of each pathway with the STRING algorithm. Lines
  represent interactions and only interactions with medium confidence (score ≥ 0.4)
  are shown. Upregulated proteins in HepG2 cells are light red, whereas downregulated
  proteins are light blue. For THLE2 cells, a dark red halo around a protein indicates
  that the protein is upregulated, whereas a dark blue halo indicates that the protein
  is downregulated
