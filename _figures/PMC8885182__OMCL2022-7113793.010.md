caption: Proposed mechanism of the effect of α-KG supplementation during IVM on the
  developmental competence of pig embryos. α-KG can reduce oxidative stress and apoptosis
  and improve mitochondrial function in oocytes. The high quality and hatching rate
  of embryos developed from α-KG-treated oocytes could be accredited to the regulation
  of Nrf2/ARE signaling.
