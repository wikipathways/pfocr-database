caption: Models for BaP metabolic utilization in A. nidulans. (A) BaP confers changes
  in energy generation pathways indicated by colored blocks. Upregulated DEGs are
  shown in yellow. Amino acids and other compounds found in greater quantity as a
  result of BaP treatment in WT but not ΔbapA strains are shown in yellow and white
  boxes, where yellow indicates statistical significance (P < 0.05). Blue boxes represent
  cellular components that significantly decrease as a result of BaP treatment in
  WT but not in ΔbapA strains (P < 0.05). (B) Proposed genetic pathway for the metabolic
  utilization of BaP in A. nidulans. Limited glucose and the VeA-VelB complex are
  associated with increased expression of bapA.
