caption: 'Overview of receptor- and transceptor-mediated nutrient activation of PKA
  in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (A) Glucose binding to the G-protein-coupled
  receptor Gpr1, together with intracellular activation of the Ras proteins triggers
  activation of adenylate cyclase (Cyr1), to synthesize cAMP. The rapid increase in
  cAMP releases the Tpk catalytic subunits from the Bcy1 regulatory subunits of PKA,
  resulting in activation or downregulation of the many downstream targets of PKA:
  trehalase activity, trehalose and glycogen levels, stress tolerance, heat shock
  protein gene expression, cell wall strength, ribosomal protein gene expression and
  many other targets. (B) Addition of other essential nutrients, in the presence of
  a fermentable carbon source, to appropriately starved yeast cells triggers activation
  of the catalytic subunits of PKA, without any increase in the cAMP level. Nutrient
  sensing happens with a specific nutrient transceptor, different for each nutrient
  and previously known as substrate starvation-induced high-affinity transporters.
  How the signal is transmitted from the nutrient transceptor to PKA is under investigation.'
