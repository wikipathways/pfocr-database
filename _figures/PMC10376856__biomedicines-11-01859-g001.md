caption: Potential targets for dietary supplements to increase nitric oxide production
  in patients with PAD. Targets include NO donors that increase substrates in the
  nitrate–nitrite–NO pathway (red), enhancers of NO availability which act on the
  citrulline–arginine–NO pathway (green), endothelial NOS inducers (yellow) and antioxidants
  (blue).
