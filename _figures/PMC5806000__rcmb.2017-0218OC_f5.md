  epithelium 3 days after infection and IL-17A addition. The mRNA levels for CCL20
  (B) and HBD-2 (C) were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR and normalized to
  GAPDH levels. Cotreatment with IL-17A and MAC additively upregulated mRNA expression
  of CCL20 and HBD-2. Triplicate Transwells were used for each experiment, and experiments
  were repeated with cultures derived from a different NHBE cell donor. *Significant

  description: IL-17 signaling pathway in NTM-infected respiratory epithelium. (A)
    The canonical pathway for IL-17A signaling in airway cells at Day 3 after infection

    that were more highly expressed in infected cells than in uninfected controls,
    and white indicates no gene expression. No genes were downregulated in this pathway.
    (B and C) IL-17A and MAC bacteria provoked additive induction of CCL20 and HBD-2
    in respiratory epithelium at Day 3 after infection. IL-17A (10 ng/ml) was added
    to basolateral media at the time of infection. Total RNA was harvested from MAC-infected
    (MOI = 1,000) respiratory epithelium 3 days after infection and IL-17A addition.
    The mRNA levels for CCL20 (B) and HBD-2 (C) were evaluated by real-time quantitative
    PCR and normalized to GAPDH levels. Cotreatment with IL-17A and MAC additively
    upregulated mRNA expression of CCL20 and HBD-2. Triplicate Transwells were used
