caption: Model of toxicity caused by repeat-containing double-stranded RNA in Drosophila.
  Bidirectional transcription of expanded repeat disease genes produces repeat-containing
  rCAG.rCUG∼100 double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). These dsRNA are cleaved by Dicer to small
  (rCAG)7 (,,). In addition, an altered miRNA profile is observed. These small RNAs
  may activate the Toll pathway leading to an innate immune response. Increased toxicity
  in glial cells may cause glial cell death and eventual neurodegeneration. Results
  in this study indicate that pathogenesis is dependent on activation of the Toll
  pathway and toxicity in glial cells is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. In
  addition, autophagy, an effector of the Toll pathway, plays a role in reducing pathogenesis
  by ‘mopping-up’ toxicity.
