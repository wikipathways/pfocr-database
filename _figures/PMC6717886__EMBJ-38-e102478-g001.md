caption: ABA binds to the intracellular PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors (14 genes in Arabidopsis).
  In the presence of ABA, the PYR/RCAR receptors bind to and inhibit type 2C protein
  phosphatases (PP2Cs, 9 genes) via a gate–latch–lock mechanism. As a result, SnRK2
  kinases (~3 to up to 10 genes) become activated by phosphorylation and thus transduce
  the message by phosphorylating many downstream ABA signaling components. Without
  ABA, PP2Cs are active and dephosphorylate SnRK2s, thus deactivating these protein
  kinases and rendering them unable to transduce the signal. SnRK2.1, 2.4, 2.5, and
  2.10 were uncovered by Ruschhaupt et al in this issue as putative new actors in
  the direct ABA signaling pathway using reconstitution in yeast, with evidence in
  plant cells for a function of SnRK2.4 in the ABA signaling core. The number of genes
  encoding the presented core signaling components is indicated in parentheses.
