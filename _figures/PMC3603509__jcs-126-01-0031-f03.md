caption: Cohesin code for cohesion and condensation. Lysine residues K112 and K113
  of Smc3 are both acetylated in vivo by Eco1. Acetylation of K113 appears essential
  for cohesion establishment during S phase. Even though K112 is similarly acetylated
  during S phase, it is the unacetylated form of K112 that supports chromosome condensation.
  Analysis of Smc3 peptides suggests a step-wise acetylation pathway on the basis
  of the recovery of both diacetylated (K112, K113) and mono-acetylated (K113) fragments.
  At present, monoacetylated K112 cannot be excluded as a path to diacetylation. Thus,
  unacetylated Smc3 could become bi-acetylated and then monoacetylated via numerous
  paths. On the basis of the differential roles of acetylation in cohesion and condensation,
  coupled with the peptide mapping studies, we hypothesize a cohesin code algorithm
  that mediates these processes in a stepwise fashion. Lysine residue K931 is also
  highly conserved through evolution and, thus, may have a regulatory role. Acetylation
  reactions that appear to promote cohesion are shown in red, those that seem to promote
  condensation are shown in blue.
