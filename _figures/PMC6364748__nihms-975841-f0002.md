caption: Positive input signals for Arf have been shown in red (our own research)
  or pink (research from other labs). Conversely, negative signals have been shown
  in black. The output signals for Arf, Mdm2, and p53 are shown in striped arrows.
  Arf is induced by potentially oncogenic signals stemming from overexpression of
  oncogenes such as c-Myc, E2F1, and activated Ras, which quenches inappropriate mitogenic
  signaling by diverting incipient cancer cells to undergo p53-dependent growth arrest
  or cell death. Positive input signals for Arf have been shown in red arrows. Conversely,
  negative signals for Arf have been shown in black. The output signals for Arf, Mdm2,
  and p53 are shown in striped arrows.Dmp1α transactivates the Arf promoter in response
  to oncogenic stresses, and physically interacts with p53 to neutralize all activities
  of Mdm2 to activate the p53 pathway in response to DNA damage (–). Both Dmp1−/−
  and Dmp1+/− mice show hypersensitivity to develop tumors in response to carcinogen
  or γ-irradiation (, ). D-type cyclins inhibit Dmp1’s activity in a Cdk-independent
  fashion in promoters lacking E2F sites; however, it cooperates with Dmp1α to activate
  the Ink4a and Arf promoters to eliminate incipient tumor cells (, ). The Dmp1 promoter
  is activated by the oncogenic Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk-Jun and HER2-Pi3k-Akt-NF-κB pathways,
  and thus Ras or HER2-driven carcinogenesis is accelerated in Dmp1-deficient mice
  (, , ). The human DMP1 locus generates three splice variants, namely DMP1α, β, and
  γ with antagonizing activity between DMP1α and β (). DMP1β and γ transcripts have
  not been reported in mice. Dmp1α physically interacts with the epigenetic modifier
  YY1 that affects EZH2 activity. YY1 binds to HDM2 and Dmp1α to accelerate HDM2-mediated
  polyubiquitination of p53. Our study shows that Dmp1α physically interacts with
  p53 through p53’s carboxyl-terminal and Dmp1’s DNA-binding domain (). Dmp1α antagonized
  p53’s ubiquitination by HDM2 both in vitro and in cell and restored p53’s nuclear
  localization that had been lost with HDM2 expression (); Dmp1 also stabilized p53
  binding to transcriptional target genes (). Dmp1α-p53 interaction increases the
  levels of p53 independent of Dmp1’s DNA-binding, and hence both p21Cip1 and Bbc3
  promoters were synergistically activated by co-expression of Dmp1α and p53 in p53−/−;
  Arf−/− cells (). In accordance, the induction of p21Cip1 and Bbc3 by genotoxic drug
  treatment was more seriously affected in Dmp1−/− and p53−/− tissues than in Arf−/−
  (). In summary, Dmp1α stimulates the p53 pathway by direct transactivation of the
  Arf promoter in response to oncogenic stresses (, , , ) and direct physical interaction
  with p53 in DNA damage response (DDR; , ).Mekk1 is activated by a variety of oxidative
  stress signaling, such as dsDNA breaks, UV, cytokines, osmotic stress, and oncogenes.
  Activation of MEKK1 by c-Abl in DDR has been reported. MEKK1 is cleaved by caspase
  3 following DNA damage to generate ΔMEKK1, which increases the Dmp1α protein by
  phosphorylation. Loss of PTEN is found in 70 % of advanced prostate cancer (PCa),
  resulting in activation of the Pi3k-Akt pathway that promotes survival by inhibiting
  apoptosis and causing genomic instability. The tumor suppressor Pten accelerates
  the conversion of Pip3 to Pip2, and thus is a negative regulator of Pi3k signaling
  pathway. In PCa, loss of PTEN drives cell cycle arrest and senescence as a tumor
  suppressive mechanism mediated by upregulation of p53 expression. Accumulating studies
  show that RNA splicing is affected by DDR, and also roles of YY1 and PTEN in DDR.
  There are feed forward/back regulations between p53 and Mdm2, p53 and Arf, and p53
  and Dmp1. In addition, Arf negatively regulates Mdm2, and Mdm2 negatively regulates
  p53 as published.
