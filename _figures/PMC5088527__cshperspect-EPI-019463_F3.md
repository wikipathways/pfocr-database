caption: The biosynthesis pathway of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and its involvement
  in chromatin-related processes. SAM is an essential cofactor for PRMT, DNMT, and
  KMT chromatin-modifying enzymes. This pathway is metabolically influenced by the
  NAD salvage pathway by virtue that the SAH hydrolase (SAHH) enzyme in its biosynthesis
  pathway uses NAD. The primary product of SAM metabolism is SAH, which has an inhibitory
  effect on all the SAM-dependent chromatin-modifying complexes. SAH, S-adenosyl homocysteine;
  HCy, homocysteine.
