caption: Schematic of the MPTP/MPP+metabolic pathway and neurotoxicity. Following
  systemic administration, MPTP readily crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Within
  the brain, MPTP is metabolized into the toxic MPP+ species by the enzymatic action
  of monoamine oxidase-b (MAO-B) within glia cells. The MPP+ is then released into
  the extracellular space where it is selectively taken up into dopamine neurons by
  the dopamine transporter (DAT). Once inside the DAergic neurons, the MPP+ is taken
  up by and concentrated within mitochondria, where it binds and inhibits mitochondrial
  complex I (C I), inducing general mitochondrial dysfunction and generating oxidative
  stress, culminating in cell death.
