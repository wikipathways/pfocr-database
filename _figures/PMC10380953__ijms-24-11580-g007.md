caption: Response mechanism of carbon fixation in photogenic organisms, arginine biosynthesis,
  alanine, aspartate, and glutamine metabolism pathways to nitrogen treatment in quinoa
  seedlings. The gene expression level was expressed through the FPKM value, while
  the metabolite level was expressed through the log2FC value of different control
  groups. ASS1, argininosuccinate synthase [EC:6.3.4.5]; ACY1, aminoacylase [EC:3.5.1.14];
  NOS1, nitric oxide synthase [EC:1.14.13.39]; ASNS, asparagine synthase (glutamine-hydrolyzing)
  [EC:6.3.5.4]; ppdK, pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase [EC:2.7.9.1]; ppc, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase [EC:4.1.1.31]; GLUD1_2, glutamate dehydrogenase [EC:1.4.1.3]. The boxes
  in the pathway represent differentially expressed genes or differentially expressed
  metabolites. Blue represents downregulated genes or metabolites, whereas red represents
  upregulated genes or metabolites. R and W represent red quinoa and white quinoa,
  respectively; 1, 2, and 3 represent LN, CK, and HN, respectively.
