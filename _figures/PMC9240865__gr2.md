caption: MBOAT7 plays a unique role in PI homeostasis by esterifying LPI to several
  PUFA acyl-CoAs including arachidonyl-CoA (20:4) to generate the most abundant PI
  species (PI 38:4; where the sn-1 position harbors a stearate 18:0 and the sn-2 position
  harbors arachidonic acid 20:4). Within the Land’s cycle, MBOAT7-dependent esterification
  opposes the actions of cytosolic PLA2, which instead cleaves PUFAs such as AA from
  38:4 PI to generate downstream AA-derived lipid mediators including leukotrienes,
  prostanoids, thromboxanes, lipoxins, and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. In parallel
  to MBOAT7-driven synthesis of 38:4 PI, the de novo “Kennedy” pathway can also generate
  large amounts of PI 38:4 using CDP-DAG as a substrate. Although MBOAT7 specifically
  regulates reacylation in the Land’s cycle, it could indirectly impact the substrate
  availability of 38:4 PI to the arachidonate PI cycle, which is initiated by a parallel
  pathway where inositol is added to CDP-DAG (18:0/20:4) by phosphatidylinositol synthase
  (PIS) to also form 38:4 PI. Current evidence suggests that both PIS-generated as
  well as MBOAT7-generated 38:4 can serve as substrate for phosphatidylinositol kinases
  to form the key second messengers known as PIPs (including PI [18:0/20:4]-4P, PI
  [18:0/20:4]-4,5P2) and lipid mediators downstream of phospholipase C in the arachidonate
  PI cycle (IP3, DAG [18:0/20:4], PA [18:0/20:4], and CDP-DAG [18:0/20:4]). CL, cardiolipin;
  G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; IP3, inositol trisphosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid,
  PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PIS, phosphatidylinositol synthase; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate;
  PI4,5-P, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PS, phosphatidylserine.
