caption: Inhibition of LTC4S enhances the production of PCTR, MCTR, and RCTR. Human
  M2-like macrophages were incubated for 1 h with the LTC4S inhibitor TK05 (5 µM)
  or 0.01% DMSO (vehicle) at 37°C and then with E. coli for 2 additional hours (O6:K2:H1;
  ratio, 1:50). A) Schema depicting TK05 structure and mode of action. B) Network
  pathway visualization of PCTR, MCTR, RCTR, and cysLT amounts in M2-like macrophages.
  Quantification was obtained by LC-MS/MS analyses. Node size represents the amount
  of CTRs and cysLTs (pg/107 cells) after TK05 treatment, and node color represents
  the fold change of each CTR and cysLT after TK05 treatment relative to vehicle (n
  = 3). See  for structures. DPEP, dipeptidase; GGT, γ-glutamyl transferase.
