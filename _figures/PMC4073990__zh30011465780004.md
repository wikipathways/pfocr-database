caption: 'Schematic description of the signaling pathways known to be activated by
  CCK1R and CCK2R. In addition to signaling pathways classically activated by G protein-coupled
  receptors such as the PLC-β/diacylglycerol (DAG)/Ca2+/PKC cascade or the adenyl
  cyclase (AC) pathway, CCK receptors also induce several other signaling pathways
  known to be activated by tyrosine kinase receptors: 1) the MAPK pathways including
  ERK, JNK, and p38-MAPK; 2) the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway; or
  3) the PLC-β pathway. Activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases including Src,
  JAK2, FAK, and PYK2 is also an early event in CCK receptor signaling. These tyrosine
  kinases are involved in particular upstream of the MAP kinase or PI3K pathways and
  in intracellular events related to cell adhesion (see text for details). Finally,
  CCK2R are also known to induce epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor transactivation.
  Arrows correspond to positive stimulations. From Ref. .'
