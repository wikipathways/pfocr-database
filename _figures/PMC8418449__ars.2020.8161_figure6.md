caption: The interplay between metabolic pathways and ROS (redox homeostasis) in physiological
  and pathological states.Left panel, glycolysis plays an essential role in the control
  of redox homeostasis by generating PPP-derived NADPH that is involved in the antioxidant
  system. FAO also generates NADPH through metabolic reactions. Glutaminolysis is
  involved in redox control by increasing GSH synthesis. During mitochondrial metabolism,
  ROS will be produced via ETC. NO• is produced by NOS by utilizing BH4, NADPH, and
  molecular O2 to convert l-arginine to l-citrulline (coupled eNOS). NOXs- and mitochondria-derived
  ROS activate redox signaling. Right panel, in pathological states such as diabetes
  and atherosclerosis, excess ROS due to eNOS uncoupling and PPP-GSH impairment inhibit
  glycolytic flux, which diverts glycolytic intermediates into alternative metabolic
  pathways such as polyol pathway (AGE production) and PKC activation. This, in turn,
  further increases mitochondria- or NOX-derived ROS production and mitochondrial
  dysfunction. mitoROS or Nox-derived ROS stabilize HIF-1α, which induces a metabolic
  shift toward glycolysis, resulting in reduced oxidative phosphorylation and mitoROS
  production. The ADMA produced by l-arginine methylation via the 1C metabolism as
  well as arginase inhibit l-arginine binding to NOS, which decreases NO production.
  The mevalonate pathway also facilitates eNOS uncoupling by RhoAprenylation induced
  by GGPP, thereby promoting excess ROS production. ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine;
  GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; PKC, protein kinase C. Color images are available
  online.
