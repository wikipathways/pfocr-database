caption: 'The four pathways by which the EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is thought
  to signal inside cells. LMP1 mediates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling through
  both the C-terminal activating region 1 (CTAR1) and CTAR2 domains via tumor necrosis
  factor receptor (TNFR) associated factor (TRAF) molecules. The TNFR associated death
  domain (TRADD)-TRAF2 complex, which binds to CTAR2, also activates the C-Jun N-terminal
  kinase (JNK)-AP-1 pathway. Both CTAR1 and CTAR2 use TRAF2 to signal via the p38/MAPK
  (mitogen activated protein kinase) axis. The recently identified box 1 and box 2
  motifs (CTAR3) activate the Janus kinas (JAK)-STAT pathway. The net result of signaling
  along these pathways is the regulation of transcription of various cellular genes
  and is responsible for many of the pleiotropic effects of LMP1. (Source: Ref.)'
