caption: Graphical summary of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 symptoms and therapeutic
  strategies. The insulin/IGF signaling pathway plays an important role in many biological
  processes, such as energy metabolism and cell survival. SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs
  transcriptional expression of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in the host lung,
  liver adipose tissue, and pancreatic cells, which is likely attributed to interferon
  regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). The pathological trait is aggravated in whole blood,
  a systemic indicator, of critical patients with COVID-19 with exacerbated cell damage,
  cell death, and metabolic abnormalities, which could be ameliorated by androgen
  (DHT) and/or glucocorticoid (DEX) interventions. Higher basal IRF1 expression by
  pathological (older age, male sex, obesity, and diabetes) and/or genetic (IRF1 intron
  variant rs17622656-A) reasons in respiratory, metabolic, and/or endocrine organs
  might contribute to synergistic upregulation of IRF1 in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  which may make the people more vulnerable to COVID-19.
