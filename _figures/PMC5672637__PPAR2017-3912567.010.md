caption: 'Schematic diagram for the functional mechanism of Aster glehni extract.
  Amelioration of nonalcoholic fatty liver by Aster glehni is mainly accomplished
  with catabolic activation such as the sequential regulation of PPARδ/adiponectin→P-AMPK→PGC-1α→SDH,
  also it is done by other pathway of P-AMPK→P-ACC which inhibits fatty acid synthesis.
  Aster glehni additionally lowers triglyceride accumulation in liver by inhibiting
  P-ACLY, also its anti-TG accumulation effect is done through the regulation of TNFα
  and SOD by P-AMPK. In addition, the extract may prevent obesity via PPARδ/adiponectin→P-AMPK→PGC
  pathway. Meaning of symbols: arrow means activation, up and horizontal line means
  inhibition, and × means blocking. Photograph of Aster glehni was quoted from Korea
  Rural Development Administration Genebank information center (PCV0039).'
