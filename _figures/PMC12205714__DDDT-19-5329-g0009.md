caption: Schematic illustration of the potential protective mechanism of BJOE in irinotecan-induced
  delayed diarrhea mice. BJOE attenuated intestinal inflammation, as indicated by
  decreased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS. It also preserved intestinal barrier
  integrity by upregulating the expression of mucins and tight junction proteins,
  including ZO-1 and Occludin. These protective effects may be associated with the
  inhibition of aberrant activation of the cGAS-STING signaling pathway
