caption: MAPK signaling pathway in stem cells. (A) Hypothetical model of signaling
  pathways in human Wharton’s jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs) cultured
  under P8-treatment conditions. P8 administration to hWJ-MSCs resulted in increased
  phosphorylation of ERK, which increased the expression of YAP and stimulated the
  expression of Cyclin D1. (B) Summary of effects of P8-treatment in stem cells. P8
  protein can increase cell proliferation, stemness, migration and cell cycle when
  treated to stem cells
