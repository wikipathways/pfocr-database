caption: 'The insulin signaling network. Examined phosphorylation sites in signaling
  intermediaries are indicated (-P). mTORC2, mammalian target of rapamycin in complex
  with rictor and Elk1 (ETS domain-containing protein). The green arrow indicates
  positive feedback signal. Red arrows indicate functional effects of insulin-resistant
  insulin signaling in T2D. The gray area indicates the focus of this investigation,
  with dashed gray arrows indicating outstanding questions answered herein: whether
  the MAPK pathway is controlled via IRS1, another adapter protein or both (1); whether
  ERK1/2 signaling cross-talks with the other branches of the insulin signaling network
  (2); and to what extent ERK1/2 signaling is affected in T2D and whether the same
  mechanisms are involved as in the rest of the signaling network (3).'
