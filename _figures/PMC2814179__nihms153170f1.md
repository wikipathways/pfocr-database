caption: The NOTCH1 receptor is activated upon interaction with Delta-like and Jagged
  ligands expressed the surface of a neighbor cell. This ligand-receptor interaction
  results in a conformational change in the LNR repeats of NOTCH1 and the dissociation
  of the two subunits of the HD domain, which is followed by cleavage of the receptor,
  first by an ADAM metalloprotease (S2 cleavage) and subsequently by the γ-secretase
  complex (S3 cleavage). This latter proteolytic processing releases the intracellular
  domains of NOTCH1 (ICN1) from the membrane. ICN1 interacts with DNA via the CSL
  DNA binding protein and recruits the MAML1 coactivator to activate the expression
  of NOTCH1 target genes.
