caption: Alcohol consumption increases intestinal permeability resulting in increased
  influx of LPS into the liver. LPS activates Kupffer cells to produce TNF. TNF binds
  to its receptor (TNFR1), which recruits TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD), RIP1,
  cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 (cIAP1/2), and linear ubiquitin chain
  assembly complex (LUBAC) and promotes the linear ubiquitination of RIP1. This leads
  to activation of NF-κB by the ubiquitin chain-dependent recruitment of transforming
  growth factor beta-activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 (TAB2) and 3 (TAB3),
  transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and the I-κB kinase (IKK)
  complex. CYLD removes the ubiquitin chain from RIP1, and de-ubiquitinated RIP1 interacts
  with TRADD, fas-associated protein with a death domain (FADD), caspase-8, and the
  CASP8 and FADD-like apoptosis regulator (CFLAR), resulting in caspase-8 activation.
  Activated caspase-8 cleaves Bid to activate the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
  and induce apoptosis; it also cleaves RIP1 and RIP3 to inactivate RIP1–RIP3-mediated
  necroptosis. When cIAPs are depleted and caspase-8 is inhibited, RIP1 and RIP3 interact
  via RHIM domains to from the amyloid-like necrosome. Auto- and trans-phosphorylated
  RIP1 and RIP3 then recruit downstream MLKL to initiate necroptosis. In the absence
  of cIAPs, RIP1, RIP3, TRADD, caspase-8, and CFLAR form a complex called the ripoptosome,
  which activates caspase-8 and apoptosis and requires RIP1 kinase activity.
