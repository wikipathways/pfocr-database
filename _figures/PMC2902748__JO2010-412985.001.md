caption: Hsp90-dependent modulation of proangiogenic signaling pathways in cancer.
  Hsp90 regulates multiple arms of angiogenic signaling in cancer. Key signaling molecules
  that are either direct clients or indirectly modulated by Hsp90 are shaded in red.
  One pathway that is commonly upregulated during tumorigenesis is the HIF/VEGF signaling
  axis. Tumor hypoxia and other stimuli induce HIF expression and subsequent activity,
  leading to a cascade of events that reinforce VEGF expression and angiogenesis.
  Importantly, several key mediators of this pathway, including HIF and VEGFR, are
  dependent upon Hsp90 for their function. As indicated, RTK activation also potently
  upregulates HIF via AKT/mTOR -mediated translation. RTKs additionally transactivate
  EphA2, a recently identified Hsp90 client protein known to participate in tumor
  vascularization. Providing another level of complexity, HIF also upregulates the
  expression of several RTK ligands (e.g., HGF and TGF-alpha), as well as RTK receptors
  (EGFR, IGFR), thereby reinforcing these signaling networks. Hsp90 additionally plays
  a role in NFκB-dependent VEGF expression and regulates downstream effectors of VEGF
  signaling, including AKT-mediated eNOS phosphorylation. Given the intertwining levels
  among Hsp90 and angiogenic signaling cascades, Hsp90 intervention is predicted to
  impair signaling at many levels within these redundant pathways, with the overall
  effect of suppressing tumor angiogenesis.
