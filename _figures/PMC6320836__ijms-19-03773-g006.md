caption: Status of proteins that participate in the autophagy pathway in glioblastoma.
  A lower expression of autophagy-related proteins like ULK1/2, FIP200, Beclin-1,
  LC3, UVRAG, Bif-1, Atg4c, and Atg5 has been shown in glioblastoma with respect to
  lower-grade gliomas, which lead to the progression of astrocytic tumors by inhibiting
  cell death (both autophagic and apoptotic). Conversely, an increase in autophagy
  in astrocytic tumors under adverse conditions has been reported to induce tumor
  survival, progression, and therapeutic resistance through an accumulation of the
  protein p62, metabolic supply, and activation of transcription factors that regulate
  the positive expression of genes with an important role in the tumor process. Black
  arrows (↓) mean activation, red truncated arrow (⊥) means inhibition.
