caption: 'The Nrf2 pathway is regulated at multiple levels by different microRNAs.
  The Nrf2 pathway has two important players: the Nrf2 transcription factor and its
  inhibitor, the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) protein. The Nrf2 interaction
  with Keap1 leads to the further binding of Cullin 3 (Cul3) and RING-box protein
  1 (Rbx1) proteins and the ubiquitination of Nrf2 proteins, resulting in proteasomal
  degradation. If Nrf2 does not bind to Keap1, it binds to the antioxidant response
  element (ARE)-containing promoter regions, and, by forming a complex with small
  V-Maf Avian Musculoaponeurotic Fibrosarcoma Oncogene (sMaf) and cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP), it leads to the further activated transcription
  of its targeted genes. MicroRNAs suppress Keap1/Nrf2 signaling at multiple levels.
  MiR-27a, miR-141 miR-144, miR-153, miR-200a, miR-432, and miR-23a repress the translation
  of Keap1 messenger RNA (mRNA), thus allowing for Nrf2 activation. MiR-155, miR-144,
  miR-28, miR-365-1, miR-93, miR-153, miR-27a, miR-142, miR-29-b1, miR-340, and miR-34a,
  either through direct repression of Nrf2 mRNA in a Keap1-independent manner or by
  enhancing the Keap1 cellular level, inhibit Nrf2 activity. MiR-181a, miR-193b, miR-424,
  and miR-125b stimulate Nrf2 activation most probably by repressing its activators.
  The Keap–Nrf2 interaction leads to the repression of miR-181c, which is involved
  in the Nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling
  pathway. MiR-200a inhibits the ubiquitination of Nrf2, thus protecting it from degradation.
  Nrf2, in addition to the classical targeted genes, can also stimulate the expression
  of the miRNA-encoding DNA region. The Keap1 protein structure was taken from the
