caption: A proposed model of cross‐talks among neutrophils, CD4+ T cells, and tumor
  cells leading to neutrophil‐mediated protumorigenic IL‐17A‐producing Th subset polarization
  and tumor progression in GC environment. CXCL6/CXCL8‐CXCR1 chemotaxis mediates the
  recruitment and accumulation of neutrophils into GC environment, which upregulate
  CD54 and B7‐H2 expression via ERK‐NF‐κB signaling pathway activation by tumor‐derived
  TNF‐α. Neutrophils polarize IL‐17A‐producing Th subsets in a B7‐H2‐dependent manner;
  these polarized IL‐17A‐producing Th cells exert protumorigenic roles via inflammatory
  molecule IL‐17A, which contributed to the growth and progression of human GC
