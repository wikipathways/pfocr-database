caption: Figure 1. PAKs and cancer hallmarks. PAKs are effectors of Rac/Cdc42 and
  play a key role in some of cancer hallmarks, including proliferative signaling,
  resisting cell death, activating invasion and metastasis and inducing angiogenesis.
  PAKs can regulate cell proliferation through the Raf/Mek pathway. Cell motility
  can be affected by PAKs phosphorylation of cytoskeletal targets, such as LIMK, which
  phosphorylates cofilin. PAK1 also phosphorylates Bad directly and indirectly via
  Raf-1, thus promoting cell survival by anti-apoptosis. NFκB is regulated by PAK
  indirectly to promote cell survival. Other cancer hallmarks are also affected indirectly
  by PAKs.
