caption: A model depicting the mechanisms for the induction of human ovarian cancer
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by hCaMKIINβ-mediated inhibition of CaMKII. Inhibition
  of CaMKII by hCaMKIINβ inactivates PI3K/Akt, which de-regulates the HDM2 expression,
  leading to the stabilization of p53 protein. p53 then regulates the transcription
  of target genes, such as p21, resulting in the cell cycle interference. On the other
  hand, p53-dependent induction of Bax and direct inhibition of Bcl-2, as well as
  p53-independent signals, promote the cellular apoptosis.
