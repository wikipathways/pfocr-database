caption: 'Regulatory mechanism of AIM2 in tumor cell proliferation and migration.
  In terms of inhibiting tumors: AIM2 causes inflammation through the inflammasome
  signaling pathway, recruits CD11b+ cell infiltration, and inhibits tumor progression;
  AIM2 can also inhibit tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by inactivating
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and Notch signaling pathway, inhibiting DNA-PK
  mediated AKT activation, inhibiting intestinal cell proliferation, and regulating
  intestinal microbiota. In terms of promoting tumors: AIM2 activates NF-κB and STAT1
  signaling through inflammasome signaling, promotes EMT progression and enhances
  PD-L1 expression, or inhibits the anti-tumor effect of p53 protein, or enhances
  PD-L1 expression through JAK/STAT3 signaling, and then suppresses T cells to promote
  tumor cell escape, or interacts with EB1 or through FOXO3a-ACSL4 axis regulation,
  ultimately promoting tumor proliferation and migration'
