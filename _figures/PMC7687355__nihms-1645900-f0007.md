caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of microarray data showing predicted activation
  of (A) TNFα signaling and (B) TGFβ signaling at 24 hr in APAP 300 group vs PHX,
  based on downstream gene expression profile. Positive z-score (absolute z-score
  > 2 considered as significant) represents predicted activation of upstream regulator
  based on expression profile of downstream genes. p-values signifies extent of overlap
  between set of downstream target genes of a upstream regulator in dataset compared
  to all known downstream target genes of that upstream regulator in the reference
  genome. (red shapes: upregulated genes; green shapes: downregulated genes with intensity
  of color reflecting extent of upregulation or downregulation; orange center shape:
  predicted activation)'
