caption: A schema of a potential pathophysiologic pathway to superficial erosion as
  a cause of thrombotic complications of atherosclerotic plaques. The bottom of the
  diagram depicts a longitudinal section of an artery effected by a proteoglycan-rich
  atherosclerotic plaque. The darker brown indicates accumulation of the proteoglycans
  such as hyaluronan, versican, and biglycan. The left side of this diagram (1) shows
  some of the putative triggers for causing endothelial damage as an underlying cause
  of superficial erosion. Such triggers include pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMPs), danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and other ligands for innate
  immune receptors including TLR2, the subject of this report. These ligands bind
  to pattern recognition receptors on the surface of the endothelial cell. Hyaluronic
  acid, a common constituent of plaques that have undergone superficial erosion, may
  act as a TLR2 ligand. Various apoptotic stimuli derived from the inflammatory cells
  in plaques as well as modified lipoproteins can promote apoptosis of endothelial
  cells. Matrix degrading enzymes such as the matrix metalloproteinases can attack
  constituents of the basement membrane that provides a substrate for endothelial
  cell adhesion mediated by integrins among other adhesion molecules of the basal
  surface of the endothelial cell. The non-fibrillar collagenases MMP-2 and MMP-9
  and the activator of MMP-2, MMP-14, enzymes often overexpressed in plaques, may
  sever the tethers of the endothelial cell to the intimal surface. The right side
  of this diagram (2) shows some of the consequences of erosion. Once an endothelial
  cell has desquamated (as depicted by the damaged endothelial cell with the pycnotic
  nucleus) the dying endothelial cell can release microparticles that bear tissue
  factor that can accelerate the activity of factors VII and X to augment thrombin
  formation and ultimately the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin yielding an increase
  in blood coagulation. Exposure of the sub-endothelial matrix can provide a substrate
  for granulocyte adhesion, activation, and degranulation. Granulocytes are a source
  of reactive oxygen species such as hypochlorous acid, HOCI, a product of myeloperoxidase
  (MPO), and also superoxide anion (O2−). Granulocytes arrive after the initial disruption
  in the endothelial monolayer according to this scheme. Granulocytes can also release
  the calgranulin family member MRP-8/14 implicated in inflammation and other aspects
  of atherothrombosis. Dying granulocytes release DNA and histones contributing to
  the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These structures can form
  a nidus for extension of thrombosis and entrapment of further blood leukocytes amplifying
  the local inflammatory response. Exposure of the sub-endothelial extracellular matrix
  macromolecules can activate platelets causing them to degranulate and release pro-inflammatory
  mediators such as interleukin-6 and RANTES. Activated platelets also release plasminogen
  activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a major inhibitor of endogenous fibrinolytic enzymes.
  PAI-1 can thus reduce fibrinolysis and increase clot stability.
