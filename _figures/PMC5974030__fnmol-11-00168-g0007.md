caption: Schematic model in which Shh pathway activation positively feeds into the
  activities of the Notch signaling pathway resulting in upregulation of TLX, a direct
  target of Notch1/RBPJ, positively regulated by Sox2 and overexpressed in the DG
  of Ptch1+/− mice. TLX is a critical transcription factors for balancing neural stem
  cells (NSCs) maintenance with neuronal differentiation and its upregulation is likely
  to promote neurogenic division and repress terminal differentiation, leading to
  transit amplifyingprogenitor (TAP) cells accumulation and depletion of newborn neurons
  and astrocytes. The outcomes of this dysregulation are morphological and cellular
  and molecular defects in the hippocampus of Ptch1+/− mice that are fully compatible
  with the phenotype of TLX Tg mice showing DG elongation and enhanced proliferation
  of neural progenitors. Significantly up- and down-regulated genes are indicated
  in red and blue, respectively. Activation (arrow lines); inhibition (cut lines).
