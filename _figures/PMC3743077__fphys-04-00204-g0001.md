caption: Glyoxylate generation and consumption. (A) Glyoxylate is generated from different
  precursor molecules and converted into stable metabolites for further utilization.
  The proteins involved are ureidoglycolate hydrolase (UGH), isocitrate lyase (ICL),
  glycolate oxidase (GO), malate synthase (MLS), glutamine:glyoxylate aminotransferase
  (GGAT). (B) In the glyoxylate cycle two acetyl-CoA are condensed to succinate and
  2 CoA (not shown). The proteins involved are citrate synthase (CIT), aconitase (ACO),
  isocitrate lyase (ICL), malate synthase (MLS), malate dehydrogenase (MDH). (C) The
  generation and consumption of glyoxylate in the photorespiratory process. The stoichiometry
  of the reaction sequence to obtain three molecules of 3-phospho-glycerate from two
  oxygenation products of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate is indicated by the numbers below
  the molecules (1×, 2×). The proteins involved are ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase-oxygenase
  (RuBisCO), phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGLP), glycolate oxidase (GO), glutamine:glyoxylate
  aminotransferase (GGAT), glycine-decarboxylase (GlyDC), serine-hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT), serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT), hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR),
  glycerate kinase (GLYK). (D) The reactions in the purine degradation pathway leading
  to glyoxylate. The proteins involved are urate oxidase (UO), allantoin synthase
  (HIU-hydrolase + OHCU decarboxylase) (AS), allantoinase (alantoin amidohydrolase)
  (AL), allantoate amidohydrolase (AAH), ureidoglycine aminohydrolase (UGlyAH), ureidoglycolate
  amidohydrolase (UAH).
