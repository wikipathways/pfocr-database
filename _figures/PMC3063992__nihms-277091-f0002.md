caption: Current model for the ethylene signal transduction pathway. The ethylene
  receptor complexes comprising subfamily I and II members act synergistically but
  differentially to activate the CTR1 PK activity in the ER without ethylene binding
  [,,]. Arabidopsis RTE1 and tomato GR are orthologous negative regulators of ethylene
  signaling and are localized in the ER and Golgi [,-]. CTR1 is probably an MKKK that
  activates multiple MKKs and MPKs as cascades, and outcomes of the activated cascades
  then phosphorylate the Thr592 and Thr546 residues of the transcription factors EIN3
  and EIL1, respectively, in the nucleus [,,]. The CTR1-dependent phosphorylation
  of EIN3 and EIL1 might enhance their interaction with the F-box proteins EBF1 and
  EBF2 to promote protein degradation through the 26S proteasome and suppress ethylene
  signaling [,-,]. Upon ethylene binding to the receptors, CTR1 is inactivated, resulting
  in the simultaneous suppression of the CTR1–MAPK pathway and the activation of the
  MKK9–MPK3 and -6 cascade, which phosphorylates the Thr174 and Thr176 of EIN3 and
  EIL1, respectively, in the nucleus []. MKK9–MPK3 and -6-dependent phosphorylation
  of EIN3 and EIL1 probably increases their stability by reducing their interaction
  with EBF1 and -2. It is unclear whether MKK9–MPK3 and -6 is activated by an MKKK
  that is different from CTR1. The expression of MKK7 is activated by ethylene and
  might act in long-term responses []. EIN2 is a membrane protein that is crucial
  for the accumulation of EIN3 [,]. EIN5 (EIN7, XRN4, AIN1) indirectly affects the
  transcript levels of EBF1 and -2 [-].
