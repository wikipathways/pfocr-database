caption: 'Model for the blue light-PPIX-1O2signaling and transduction pathway, and
  regulation by the CarA-CarS repressor-antirepressor pair in M. xanthus. In the dark,
  the anti-σ factor CarR (with a six transmembrane-helix topology; IM: inner membrane)
  sequesters its cognate ECF-σ factor CarQ. Blue light excites PPIX to the high-energy
  3PPIX state, from which energy transfer to molecular O2 generates the highly reactive
  1O2. CarF produces plasmalogens (VEPE), which are required to transmit the 1O2 signal
  and cause the inactivation of CarR by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated.
  Plasmalogen cleavage by 1O2 might perturb the local membrane environment of CarR,
  or its cleavage products may interact with CarR, to alter its activity. This liberates
  CarQ, which associates with RNAP to activate promoters PQRS (which also requires
  the CarD-CarG global regulatory complex and IHF) and PI to drive expression of the
  regulatory carQRS operon and of the carotenogenic crtIb gene, respectively. CarS,
  expressed from PQRS in the light, counteracts repression of PB by CarA (see below)
  to drive expression of the carB operon, containing all but one of the carotenogenic
  genes, leading to the synthesis of carotenoids.'
