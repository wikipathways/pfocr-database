caption: 'Schematic overview of ncRNA involvement in thyroid cancer-related signaling
  pathways. Key components of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, such as AKT3, ERBB2 and VHL,
  are regulated by different miRNAs and lncRNAs in thyroid cancer. The metabolism
  of glucose is regulated by miR-143 and miR-125-5p. Well-known cancer-related pathways,
  NFκB and Wnt, are tightly regulated by miRNAs and lncRNAs in thyroid cancer. Dysregulation
  of these miRNAs and lncRNAs in various types of thyroid cancer eventually results
  in the induction of proliferation, migration and invasion, while apoptosis is suppressed.
  Note: Pink represents direct targets of miRNAs, green represents direct miRNA targets
  of lncRNAs and blue represents the indirect target of miRNA or lncRNAs.'
