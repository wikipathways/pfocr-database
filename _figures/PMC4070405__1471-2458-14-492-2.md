caption: Structural equation model analysis of data outlined after the theoretical
  framework generated through a partial least squares estimation technique, with path
  coefficients of the pathway model (i.e. inner model). The model outlines the hypothesized
  relationships among the factors in the HDLoC model. Significant direct associations
  between latent variables are presented in bold.
