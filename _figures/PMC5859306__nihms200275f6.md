caption: HPA-1 and HPA-2 are secreted proteins that might bind LIN-3/EGF via domains
  related to EGF binding regions of EGF receptor to limit signaling. Alternatively,
  HPA-1 and HPA-2 might interact with EGFR/LET-23 to prevent EGF/LIN-3 binding. In
  either case, the activities of HPA-1 and HPA-2 normally down-regulate EGF signaling.
  When HPA-1 or HPA-2 are disrupted, EGF signaling is increased, with the EGFR activating
  the downstream signaling pathway that includes phospholipase-Cγ (PLC-3) and the
  IP3 receptor (ITR-1) to promote healthspan as evidenced by low age pigment accumulation,
  extended locomotory function, and increased median lifespans. Note that activation
  of ITR-1 signaling in the adult appears necessary to confer a healthspan benefit
  for locomotory aging. Activation of the EGF or IP3R pathways later in life could
  be a therapeutic consideration for combating sarcopenia and other aspects of age-related
  decline.
