caption: 'Scheme showing the infection process, the major differences between indeterminate
  and determinate nodules, and some key metabolic pathways in the nodule cells. (A)
  Briefly, the infection process is as follows: legume roots release flavonoids to
  the rhizosphere which induce the production of nodulation (Nod) factors in compatible
  rhizobia (depicted as red dots next to root hairs); Nod factors are recognized by
  root receptors that activate the symbiotic signaling pathway; rhizobia enter the
  root through hairs that curve and trap the bacteria inside a curl; invaginations
  of the cell membrane form infection threads that permit the invasion of the root
  cortex by rhizobia; a new nodule meristem forms underneath the site of infection;
  as the nodule grows, the bacteria are released into membrane-bound compartments,
  the symbiosomes, inside the nodule cells, where the bacteria differentiate into
  bacteroids and start N2 fixation. As a result, two major types of nodules are formed.
  Indeterminate nodules of Medicago truncatula and crops such as pea and alfalfa contain
  a persistent meristem and are generally elongated with a longitudinal gradient of
  age. Four zones can be distinguished from the apex (distal) to the base (proximal)
  regions: zone I (meristem), zone II (infection), zone III (N2-fixing), and zone
  IV (senescent). Determinate nodules of Lotus japonicus and of crops such as soybean
  and common bean lack permanent meristems and are usually spherical. In this case,
  N2 fixation takes place in the central infected zone, which also contains uninfected
  or interstitial cells. Abbreviations of cell layers: c, cortex; e, epidermis; en,
  endodermis; p, pericycle; vb, vascular bundle. (B) Some key processes in the symbiotic
  nodule cells. Sucrose from the shoot is metabolized to malate that is transported
  into bacteroids through dicarboxylate transporters (Dct). In the bacteroids, malate
  is oxidized, providing energy through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the
  electron transport chain (ETC) for nitrogenase (N2ase) activity. Fixed nitrogen
  in the form of ammonium is transported back to the plant where, with some exceptions,
  it is assimilated into the amides glutamine and asparagine in indeterminate nodules
  or ureides in determinate nodules. In the cytoplasm of infected cells, leghemoglobin
  (Lb) transports and delivers O2 to the symbiosomes at a low steady concentration
  to avoid the inhibition of nitrogenase, but to simultaneously allow high rates of
  bacteroid respiration. After , , and .'
