caption: 'Enriched pathway analysis: The entities in the diagram colored purple are
  hits within positive gene list. Proteins are rectangles whereas elongated hexagons
  are complexes. Different Reactome pathways are highlighted in colors corresponding
  to their FDR values. (A) Lipid digestion, mobilization, and transport. (B) Metabolism
  of vitamins and cofactors. (C) Platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation.
  (D) Signaling by NOTCH4.'
