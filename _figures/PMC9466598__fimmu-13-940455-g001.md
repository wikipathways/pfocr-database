caption: 'A simplified display of the canonical Hedgehog signaling pathway and treatment
  of rheumatic diseases by targeting the pathway. Left panel: In the absence of Hh
  ligands, Ptch suppresses any inactive Smo, leaving Sufu free to bind to Gli activator
  (Glia), thus repressing it and keeps Hh target genes switch off. Right panel: Binding
  of Hh ligands to Ptch leading to the dis-inhibition of Smo, which then inhibits
  Sufu, thereby releasing the nuclear translocation of Glia proteins. Activated Glia
  in the cytoplasm then translocate into the nucleus and promote transcription of
  Hh target genes. And there are inhibitors of different genes to suppress the activation
  of this pathway. Hh-Hedgehog; Ptch-Patched; Smo-Smoothened; Gli-glioma-associated
  oncogene; Glia-Gli activator; Glir-Gli repressor; Sufu-Suppressed fusion protein;
