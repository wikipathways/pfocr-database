caption: Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of
  nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) hypersensitivity. AA can be metabolized
  by either the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway or 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) pathway [].
  Inhibition of COX enzymes by NSAIDs shifts the conversion of AA to the 5-LOX pathway,
  leading to decreased production of prostaglandins (PGs) and increased production
  of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTs). Lipoxin (LX) A4/B4 are synthesized either from
  LTA4 or from 15S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE). In addition, aspirin
  acetylates COX-2, transforming AA to 15(R)-HETE and then to 15-epi-LX by 5-LOX [].
  In NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease patients, the production of LX and 15-epi-LX,
  which have anti-inflammatory effects, could be decreased, possibly due to the excessive
  usage of AA for LT synthesis. FLAP, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein.
