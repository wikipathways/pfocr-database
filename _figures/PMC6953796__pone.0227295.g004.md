caption: 'Comparison of the expression profiles of genes encoding enzymes that participate
  in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle under oily conditions in P. antarctica
  T-34 (A) and U. maydis UM521 (B). To facilitate the comparison of the two microorganisms,
  portions of the metabolic pathways of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are presented, and
  the behaviors of genes encoding the enzymes that catalyze each step were estimated.
