caption: 'A: Predefined interfaces applied to publicly-available glycolysis, pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) modules may allow appropriate
  computational linkage (double-headed arrows) between the first two models but prevent
  linkage with the third. The interfaces on the glycolysis and PPP models expose codewords
  representing the concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate (“Gluc6P,” “g6p”), fructose
  6-phosphate (“Fruc6P,” “f6p”), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (“Glyc3P,” “g3p”)
  but conceal the glycolysis model codeword representing pyruvate concentration (“Pyr”),
  a critical coupling point between the glycolysis and TCA cycle models. B: Using
  SAIM, all modeling elements are exposed and semantically defined, allowing biologically
  consistent coupling of the three modeling components at the time of composition.'
