caption: '(A) Gene organization of the salinamide (sln) biosynthetic gene cluster
  from Streptomyces sp. CNB-091 (see  for the proposed function assignments of the
  coding sequences). (B) Proposed biosynthesis of salinamides. The A domain of Sln8
  is able to accept isoleucine and valine; consequently two different salinamide series
  are biosynthesized. All ‘Ile’ derivatives, 1–3 and 5–8, are illustrated within this
  figure, however 4 is the only ‘Val’ derivative represented as it is a significant
  pathway product (see ). Abbreviations: A, adenylation; AT, acyltransferase; C, condensation;
  CP, carrier protein; E, epimerization; FAS, fatty acid synthase; p-HPG, hydroxyphenylglycine;
  KR, ketoreductase; KS, ketosynthase;; MT, methyltransferase; TE, thioesterase.'
