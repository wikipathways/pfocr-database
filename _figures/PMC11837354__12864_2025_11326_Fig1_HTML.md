caption: Main metabolic pathway of catecholamine biosynthesis. The pathway begins
  with the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which
  is catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) converts DOPA
  to dopamine (DA); then, the synthesis of norepinephrine (NE) from dopamine is catalyzed
  by dopamine B-hydroxylase (DBH). Norepinephrine is then metabolized by monoamine
  oxidase (MAO) into Norepinephrine aldehyde which is converted by Aldehyde reductase
  into DOPEG that is finally excreted in the urine
