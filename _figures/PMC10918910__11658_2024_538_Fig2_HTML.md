caption: Mechanisms of AhR activation by microbiome in the tumor microenvironment.
  The microbiome within the tumor microenvironment secretes a variety of metabolites,
  including SCFAs, formate, and tryptophan-derive indoles, which promote immune tolerance
  and metastasis through activation of the AhR pathway. Furthermore, the release of
  TNF-⍺ and IL-6 in response to LPS in tumor-associated macrophages and dendritic
  cells (antigen-presenting cells; APCs) upregulates IDO activity in the resident
  APCs and tumor cells, leading to local overproduction of Kyn from tryptophan, which
  activates AhR to further promote immune tolerance. Created with BioRender.com
