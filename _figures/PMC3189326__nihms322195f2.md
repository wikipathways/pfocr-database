caption: A) Notch can bind to transmembrane ligands of the Delta and Serrate/Jagged
  families. Fringe is a glycosyltransferase that modifies Notch and enhances a Delta-specific
  response (green arrows) while inhibiting Serrate/Jagged-specific responses (red
  arrows). B) Two yeast MAPK pathways that share components. Nutrient limitation activates
  the filamentous growth pathway through Msb2 (green arrows). Osmotic stress activates
  the HOG pathway through Msb2 and Hkr1 (red arrows). Reduced glycosylation of Msb2
  specifically triggers the filamentous growth pathway through a core module composed
  of proteins that are shared between the two pathways, shown in grey. The lighter
  dashed red arrows designate a function for Msb2 in the HOG pathway.
