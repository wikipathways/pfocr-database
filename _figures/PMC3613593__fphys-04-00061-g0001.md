caption: 'Hedgehog pathway. The Hedgehog (HH) ligand precursor undergoes a series
  of modifications until reaching an active, multimeric form (shown in yellow). All
  three HH ligands then signal through the same pathway: following multimeric HH ligand
  release from Dispatched (DISP) and secretion from the signaling cell, the HH ligand
  binds to Patched (PTCH) on the receiving cell, releasing Smoothened (SMO) from constitutive
  inhibition (Cohen, ). Released SMO then shuttles through the cilia. This signals
  activation of the Gli2/3 complex (shown as Gli2/3A), which promotes gene expression
  via Gli1, while simultaneously inhibiting the Gli3 repressor form (shown as Gli3R).
  In the presence of HH activated SMO, the Kif3a motor complex promotes Gli2/3A expression
  and inhibits repression by Gli3R (Rohatgi and Scott, ). HHAT is necessary for post-translational
  palmitoylation of HH; in the absence of HHAT, HH secretion is decreased (Dennis
  et al., ). In the presence of HH, BOC, CDO, and GAS1 bind to PTCH to form complexes
  which repress SMO, allowing downstream signaling through Gli to continue (Izzi et
  al., ). RAB23 (shown in red) functions as a negative regulator of the HH pathway,
  most likely through interaction with the Gli2 activator and Gli3 repressor forms.
  Please note, the depiction of SMO as a 7-transmembrane protein and both PTCH and
  DISP as a 12-transmembrane protein correspond to their respective biological conformations
  (De Rivoyre et al., ; Cohen, ).'
