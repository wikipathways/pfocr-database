caption: 'Enhanced high-level Reactome pathway diagram for O2/CO2 exchange in erythrocytes
  by expression overlay with the MGI RNA-seq Post7 dataset (credit: Jassal B and May
  B at European Bioinformatics Institute; New York University Langone Medical Center;
  Ontario Institute for Cancer Research; Oregon Health and Science University). This
  high-level diagram represents two subpathways, namely erythrocyte take up oxygen
  and release carbon dioxide and erythrocyte take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen.
  The green band indicates the proportion of the pathway that is represented in the
  MGI RNA-seq Post7 dataset, and the colour (green) represents the down-regulation
  of the pathway genes. The grey bar contains the information on the number of pathway
  entities in the query dataset, the total number of the pathway entities, and the
  FDR corrected over-representation probability.'
