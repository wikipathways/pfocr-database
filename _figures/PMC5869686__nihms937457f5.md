caption: (A) Representation of the TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt pathway. Promysalin
  inhibits Sdh, which in turn inhibits the TCA pathway (bottom left). (B) Zone of
  inhibition assay in TSB (nutrient rich media, top) and M9 minimal media (with succinate
  as sole carbon source, bottom) against PA14, PAO1, PP KT2440, and PP RW10S1 (producing
  strain), L to R, when treated with promysalin (P), gentamicin (G), and DMSO (D).
