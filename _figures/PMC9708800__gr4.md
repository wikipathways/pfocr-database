caption: 'Mechanisms of NLRP3 activation in OA chondrocytesChondrocytes have become
  active players driving NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent mechanisms. Stimulation of these
  cells with LPS or calcium-containing crystals, which are critical activators of
  the NF-κB signaling pathway favors the transcription of NLRP3, ASC, CASP1, IL1B,
  and IL18. Moreover, IL-1β can also activate several pathogenic processes, for instance,
  NF-κB activation and overexpression of miRNAs that function as activators of NLRP3.
  The miR-30b-3p directly induces the activation of NLRP3 and binds to SIRT1 mRNA,
  which is involved in chondrocyte apoptosis induction. The miR-244-5p act by blocking
  the inhibitory effect of the long-non-coding RNA SNHG7, an inhibitor of NLRP3. Adenosine
  is another NLRP3 inductor after binding with A2AR, A2BR, and A3R. Similarly, ATP
  can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome by interacting with P2X7R and P2X4R. Complex
  mechanisms have also been described for NLRP3 activation, i.e., the stimulation
  of chondrocytes with H2O2 caused upregulation of USP7. USP7 is a ubiquitin protease
  capable of deubiquitinating NOX4, thus, preventing NOX4 proteasomal degradation.
  NOX4 promotes the release of ROS, a process that leads to oxidative stress and converges
  in NLRP3 activation. An additional mechanism for NLRP3 activation is mediated by
  the upregulation of Ctbp in cartilage from OA patients, where Ctbp proteins act
  as transcriptional co-activators of the AP1 transcription factor. The active complex
  Ctbp-p300-AP1 specifically binds to the promoter region of the NLRP3 gene promoting
  its transcription in OA chondrocytes. On the other hand, NRF2 functions as a transcriptional
  repressor of NLRP3 and NF-κB in an HO-1-dependent mechanism; however, in OA several
  molecules such as AGEs inhibit the effect of NRF2 and contribute to the promotion
  and maintenance of the inflammatory process. Abbreviations: IL-1β, Interleukin-1
