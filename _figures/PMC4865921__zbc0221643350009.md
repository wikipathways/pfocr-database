caption: Schematic summary of the results. Stimulation of p75NTR with pro-NGF or NGF
  activates p38 MAPK signaling in the hepatocytes resulting in caspase-3 activation
  in the membrane fraction. Caspase-3 in turn cleaves SREBP2 with the subsequent release
  of the amino-terminal part of SREBP2 activating LDLR gene expression. The increased
  of LDLR levels results in an enhanced cellular uptake of LDL particles. Caspase-2
  plays a role in the regulation LDLR expression by binding pro-caspase-3 in the cell
  and probably by localizing it to the membrane. In addition NF-κB signaling is activated
  by pro-NGF in these cells that promotes cell survival. The precise molecular events
  controlling the dual signaling of p75NTR in these cells warrant further studies.
  The neurotrophin-induced pathway for SREBP2 and LDLR regulation described here may
  be particularly activated during inflammation and tissue trauma and contribute to
  metabolic disorders.
