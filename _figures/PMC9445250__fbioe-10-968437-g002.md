caption: A simplified diagram of feedstock assimilation into bioproduction pathways
  with specific attention to C1 (CO2, CO, CH4, methanol, and formate) as well as lignocellulosic
  biomass. Pathways are not exhaustive nor necessarily the most efficient, but representative
  to the selection of bioproducts reviewed. Many other routes have been successfully
  demonstrated. For example, adipic acid production is depicted from p-coumaric acid
  via the shikimate pathway and from lignin derivatives, though may be generated from
  glucaric acid, TCA intermediates, and the β-oxidation pathway. Lignin is represented
  by a single aromatic, p-coumaric acid, and cis,cis-muconic acid is usually chemically
  hydrogenated to adipic acid. Likewise, certain pathways have been simplified for
  clarity (e.g., lysine and CO assimilation). 3-HP acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid;
  6PG, 6-phosphogluconate; CoA, coenzyme A; CODH, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate;
  F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase; G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate; MEP, methylerythritol 4-phosphate;
  MVA, mevalonate; OAA, oxaloacetate; PCA, p-coumaric acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PHB, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate; R5P, ribose 5-phosphate; rGly, reductive glycine pathway;
