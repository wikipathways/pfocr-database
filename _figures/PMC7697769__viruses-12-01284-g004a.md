caption: 'Schematically illustrated MetaCore pathway associated with dengue and liver
  failure. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from cells after DENV-infection and/or
  APAP-treatment were mapped to the MetaCore pathways: (a) “Immune response—Role of
  Protein Kinase regulated by double-stranded RNA (PKR) in stress-induced antiviral
  cell response” that is the main canonical pathway associated with dengue; (b) “Immune
  response—Interleukin-18 (IL-18) signaling” that is the main canonical pathway associated
  with liver failure. The thermometers in the figure indicate the DEGs in cells after
  DENV-infection and APAP-treatment (1), DENV-infection (2), and APAP-treatment (3).
  The red columns indicate upregulation and the blue columns indicate downregulation.
