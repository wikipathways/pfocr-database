caption: Common principles in feedback regulation to splicing. (A) Auto-regulation
  by unproductive AS creates a negative feedback loop. Auto-regulatory feedback is
  exerted by control of the inclusion of a PCE (highlighted in red) that contains
  a PTC. By default, splicing of the pre-mRNA (schematically depicted on the left)
  results in skipping of the PCE, generating an mRNA that encodes functional protein
  (depicted at the top). Once a critical concentration of the RBP is produced, it
  limits its own synthesis by promoting inclusion of the PCE during splicing (depicted
  below). This results in the generation of mRNAs with a shortened open reading frame
  that encodes a truncated and non-functional protein isoform. The presence of the
  PTC can furthermore trigger rapid mRNA destabilization and turnover via the NMD
  pathway. (B) Sxl auto-regulatory, positive feedback to AS generates a molecular
  switch that controls sexual development. Drosophila Sxl acts as a molecular switch
  that controls female development. Once produced, Sxl protein engages in an auto-regulatory
  positive feedback loop promoting skipping of a PCE in its own transcript (depicted
  at the top). This ensures lasting Sxl protein production and governs female development.
  Male development is characterized by the absence of functional Sxl protein and inclusion
  of the PCE during splicing. This generates mRNAs that encode a truncated and non-functional
  protein isoform and are likely degraded by the NMD pathway (depicted at the bottom).
  Exons are depicted as boxes, introns in the pre-mRNAs as lines. The AS patterns
  are indicated by dashed lines in the pre-mRNAs, open reading frames in the mature
  mRNAs (on the right of each panel) are shaded grey, and the PCEs are highlighted
  in red.
