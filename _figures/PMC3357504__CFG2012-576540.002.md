caption: Translation initiation control during growth factor stimulation, cellular
  stress, and cellular physiology. Growth factor addition activates the PI3K/PKB/mTOR
  pathway releasing the limiting translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) from a repression
  complex with 4EBP and activating S6K resulting in enhanced cap-dependent translation
  efficiency of structured mRNAs and ribogenesis. Interestingly, the tumour suppressor
  proteins PTEN, Tsc1/2, and Pp2a are involved in attenuating this pathway. Another
  limiting initiation factor, eIF2α, is involved in providing methionine-tRNA in a
  complex with the 60S ribosome subunit to start peptide synthesis once the proper
  AUG is recognised. eIF2 is phosphorylated by GCN2, PEK, HRI, or PRK in response
  to various stress conditions. Low levels of eIF4E and eIF2-GTP as a result of 4EBP
  repression or stress-induced eIF2 phosphorylation, respectively, repress cap-dependent
  translation. These conditions are optimal for translation initiation from Internal
  Ribosomal Entry Sites (IRESs). The levels of eIFs modulate translation initiation
  and this depends on the codes offered by the transcripts. Some transcripts are ideal
  to be translated under stress conditions having IRES structures in their 5′UTRs;
  others have secondary structures that are difficult to melt and hence hinder the
  scanning process. The presence of uORFs, attenuates translation initiation and also
  has a role in protein isoform formation. RNA-binding proteins modulate specific
  mRNAs by stabilising, silencing, or activating the transcripts. These RNA/protein
  complexes (RNPs) have an important role in cellular physiology. Some RNPs respond
  to oncogenic signals, while others are covalently modified and drive translation
  in response to terminal differentiation signals as in the case of the DICE elements
  (translation initiation factors in bold).
