caption: A hormonal signaling pathway that functionally couples the soma to the gonad
  in progeny producing worms. A signaling pathway that couples somatic homeostasis
  to the reproduction state in the gonads. In reproducing worms, biosynthesis of the
  sterol ligand DA by DAF-9 transduces a longevity signal from the gonads to the soma
  by activating the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, which, in turn, augments the
  transcriptional induction of longevity-promoting genes by potentiating DAF-16 nuclear
  localization.
