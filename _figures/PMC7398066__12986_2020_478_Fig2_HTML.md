caption: 'ABC transporter-related signaling pathways. A: Inhibition of ABC transporters
  can lead to an increase in oxLDL (shown by dotted line). oxLDL can cause inflammation
  through the LOX-1/NF-κB pathway to induce ROS production. B: LPS can induce ABCA1
  via the TLR4/GPS2/NF-κB pathway to upregulate the gene expression of ABCA1. C: The
  PKC/PI3-K/Akt/JNK/LXR/RXR pathway is positively correlated with the expression of
  ABCA1. D: CRH can inhibit the activation of LXR (shown by dotted line) via the CRHR1/PI3-K/Akt
  pathway. E: IGF-1 can induce the PI3-K/Akt/FOXO1 pathway to activate FOXO1 which
  can facilitate the transcription of ABCA1 and ABCG5/8. F: MAPK1 can induce the expression
  of ABCA1. H: Expression of ABC transporters can inhibit the activation of SREBP
  (shown by dotted line), which can reduce lipogenesis. Abbreviation: ABC: Adenosine
  triphosphate-binding cassette; oxLDL: Oxidized low-density lipoproteins; LOX-1:
  Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1; ROS: Reactive oxygen species;
  LPS: Lipopolysaccharides; TLR4: Toll-like receptor 4; GPS2: G protein pathway suppressor
  2; PKC: Protein kinase C; PI3-K: Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Akt: Protein kinase
