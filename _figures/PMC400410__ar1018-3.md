caption: Functional associations of genes selected as differentially expressed in
  patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and normal controls. Tabular data
  from differential expression analysis were analyzed using Pathway Assist software.
  The graphical output delineating a functionally related network of genes is shown.
  Genes that were expressed at higher levels in JRA patients are represented as red
  ovals. Genes expressed at higher levels in controls are represented as blue ovals.
  Major biologic processes related to these genes are represented as yellow rectangles.
  White ovals represent genes that are functionally related to the genes used for
  analysis. Upon addition of these genes, several functional connections among the
  genes being analyzed can be observed. Green squares signify that a defined regulatory
  relationship exits between genes. Blue squares signify that a putative regulatory
  relationship between genes has been identified but not biochemically defined. +,
  positive regulation; -, negative regulation.
