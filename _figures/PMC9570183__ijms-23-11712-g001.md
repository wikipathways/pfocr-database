caption: Molecular mechanism represents the role of kaempferol in epigenetic modulation
  during cancer and how it protects from cancer. Kaempferol protecting against cancer
  via a different mechanism such as inhibition of DNMT3B which prematurely degrades
  and blocks proteasome with MGI32 further causes autophagy via G9a inhibition and
  ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis; on the other hand, reactivated DACT2 inhibits Wnt-β-catenin
  signaling pathway and leads to impairment of the CRC cell proliferation and migration
  further causes epigenetic modulation and protects against cancer; increased localization
  of the IRE-JNK CHOP from cytosolic to the nucleus further inhibits G9a; decreased
  DACT2 methylation; increased unmethylated DACT2 binds directly to DNA methyltransferase
  DNMT1 and is involved in epigenetic modulation during cancer.
