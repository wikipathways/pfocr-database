caption: Mechanisms of oncogenic FGFR signaling in gastrointestinal stromal tumors
  (GISTs). FGFR signaling contributes to oncogenesis through several ligand-dependent
  and -independent mechanisms in GISTs, signaling through RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, signal
  transducers and activator of transcription (STATs), phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). (A)
  Activating mutations resulting in increased kinase activity in absence of ligand
  are present in quadruple WT GISTs. (B) Chromosomal translocations drive the fusion
  of parts of FGFR1 to other genes, thereby resulting in receptor hyperactivation
  in a ligand-independent manner. These events were identified in quadruple WT GISTs.
  (C) FGFRs can be stimulated by their ligands either in a paracrine fashion, through
  FGFs produced by stromal cells, or in an autocrine manner, when FGFs are produced
  directly from the tumor cells that also express FGFRs. In quadruple WT GISTs, FGF4
  is overexpressed through genomic duplication of the FGF4 locus, while SDH-deficient
  GISTs overexpress FGF3/FGF4 by an epigenetic mechanism linked to hyper-methylation
  of the FGF4 insulator that disrupts CTCF binding, thus allowing the ANO1 super-enhancer
  to activate the FGF genes. In KIT-mutant GISTs, a role for autocrine or paracrine
  FGFR signaling has been proposed driving imatinib resistance.
