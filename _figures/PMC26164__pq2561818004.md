caption: 'A model which illustrates the super regulation in  R. sphaeroides of three
  processes: photosynthesis,  CO2 assimilation, and N2 fixation. Regulation  of each
  process is affected by the RegA/RegB two component signal  transduction system with
  RegB the sensor kinase and RegA the response  regulator component. For each process,
  hypothetical unknown  component(s) (X, Y, and Z) are required to transduce the signal
  from  RegA to specific sequences that control the Calvin–Benson–Bassham  (cbb),
  photosystem (puf, puh, puc), and  nitrogen (nif) regulons, respectively. Photochemical  reactions
  and organic carbon oxidation both might generate large  amounts of reductant. When
  the CBB pathway is blocked in the RubisCO  deletion mutants, excess reducing power
  is directed to the nitrogenase  system [also see Mosley et al. () and Bauer and
  Bird  ()].'
