caption: Under high glucose conditions, the activity of AMPK, the major energy-sensing
  enzyme, is reduced and phosphorylation of PGC1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial
  gene expression, is suppressed, resulting in impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and
  low mitochondrial mass. A decrease in SIRT3 activity after CD38 upregulation is
  associated with impaired antioxidant capacity and excessive ROS production in mitochondria.
  Reduced HIF1 expression is also associated with mitochondrial ROS overproduction
  under high glucose conditions. Overexpression of MIOX can enhance the effects of
  high glucose by inhibiting the PINK1/parkin pathway. TXNIP can inhibit autophagy/mitophagy
  flux via mTOR signaling in renal tubular cells under high glucose conditions. The
  lncRNA NEAT1 inhibits mitophagy via the miR150-5p-Drp1 axis. Upregulation of TIPE1
  in tubular epithelial cells disrupts PHB2-mediated mitophagy. PACS2 downregulation
  interferes with MAM integrity and suppresses mitophagy progression. Upregulation
  of PGAM5 can promote Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission. Activation of SDF-1α/CXCR4/STAT3
  signaling by hyperglycemic conditions increases mitochondrial fission through OPA1
  inhibition. p66Shc mediates hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and
  apoptosis signaling.AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
