caption: Angiotensinogen (AGT) produced by glial cells is transformed by renin to
  form Ang-I, which is then converted by ACE into Ang-II. This octapeptide can be
  hydrolyzed by ACE2 to form Ang-(1-7) or converted to the heptapepetide Ang-III by
  aminopeptidase A (APA) and further degraded to Ang-IV by aminopeptidase N (APN).
  ACE2 also cleaves Ang-I to Ang-(1-9), the latter being converted by ACE into Ang-(1-7).
  Ang-(1-7) can also be formed by neprilysin (NEP) from Ang-I or Ang-(1-9). ACE metabolizes
  Ang-(1-7) to the inactive peptide Ang-(1-5). The recently discovered Ang-(1-12)
  could originate from AGT and potentially generate Ang-II or Ang-(1-7). Ang-II acting
  on AT1 receptors (AT1R) can activate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK),
  leading to enhanced p38 kinase activity, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and increased
  expression of c-jun and c-fos. AT1R also ultimately increase reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) production via NAD(P)H oxidase (not represented here). On the other side AT2R
  oppose AT1R-mediated signaling. Ang-(1-7) acting on the Mas receptor may attenuate
  the actions of the ACE/Ang-II/AT1R pathway through inhibition of the MAPKK pathway
  and stimulation of nitric oxide (NO) release. In addition to Ang-II, renin binding
  to (Pro)renin receptors (PRR) and Ang-III binding to AT1R also trigger activation
  of the MAPKK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. AT4R/IRAP activation induces c-fos expression
  and probable NO release.
