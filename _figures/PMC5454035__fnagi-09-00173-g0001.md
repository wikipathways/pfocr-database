caption: Regulation of autophagy by nutrients and hormones via the mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. (A) Autophagosome induction begins with the
  activation of the ULK1/2 protein kinase complex that includes the autophagy related
  proteins (Atgs, where Atg13 is indispensable) and the 200 kDa focal adhesion kinase
  family-interacting protein (FIP200). This is followed by a nucleation step that
  is dependent on the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or human vacuolar protein
  sorting 34 (hVps34), complexed with BCL-2 interacting moesin-like coiled-coil protein
  1 (Beclin 1) and Vps15. Phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) by hVps34
  signals the recruitment of other autophagy proteins required for elongation. Beclin
  1 is involved in two recruitment complexes, the Atg14L and UV radiation resistance-associated
  gene (UVRAG) complex, which are required for phagophore formation and phagocytosis,
  respectively. Elongation and closure of the autophagosome requires several Atg proteins,
  hVps34 and microtubule-associated light chain 3 phosphatidylethanolamine (LC3),
  which is regulated by GTPase Rab5. The outer membrane of the autophagosome then
  fuses with a lysosome, exposing the inner single membrane to lysosomal hydrolases
  whereby the contents are degraded. (B) Hormones and growth factors such as insulin
  and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) trigger mTORC1 activity through a cascade
  of events resulting in recruitment and activation of Akt which induces phosphorylation
  and degradation of tuberous sclerosis complex protein 2 (TSC2). TSC2 degradation
  permits GTP-bound Rheb to directly interact and activate mTORC1. The Ras-ERK pathway
  also activates mTORC1 through inhibitions of TSC1 and TSC2. (C) Amino acids, in
  particular leucine, regulate the mTORC1 through the Rag complex (Ras-related GTPase),
  which recruits mTOR to the lysosomes with Rheb and hVps34. (D) Inhibition of the
  amp-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway is triggered by high glucose
  levels, resulting in the decrease of AMP:ATP ratio that inhibits TSC1 and TSC2,
  activating mTORC1 and inhibiting autophagy.
