caption: The signaling pathway from chondroitin sulfatases ARSB and GALNS involves
  changes in chondroitin 4-sulfation and chondroitin 6-sulfation, and leads to the
  inhibition of SHP2 activity due to increased binding with C4S. Decline in SHP2 activity
  leads to the sustained phosphorylation and activation of phospho-ERK1/2 and to the
  increased nuclear DNA binding of Myc/Max. DNMT activity and expression are also
  increased by changes in the chondroitin sulfatases, leading to increased promoter
  methylation of DKK3, reduced mRNA expression of DKK3, and increased activation of
  the Wnt pathway. The disinhibition of Wnt signaling due to reduced DKK3 expression
  leads to increased TCF/LEF nuclear DNA binding, increased nuclear β-catenin, and
  the increased expression of c-Myc and GATA-3. [ARSB=arylsulfatase B=N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase;
  C4S=chondroitin 4-sulfate; C6S=chondroitin 6-sulfate; DKK=Dickkopf; ERK=extracellular-signal
  regulated kinase; GALNS=galactosamine-(N-acetyl)-6-sulfatase; N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase;
  galactose-6-sulfate sulfatase; P=phosphate group; S=sulfate group; TCF-LEF=T-cell
  factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor].
