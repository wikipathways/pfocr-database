caption: Model of the role of BMP4 in regulating hyperandrogenism development. Normal
  BMP4 inhibited the androgen and promoted estrogen synthesis via Smad signaling in
  ovary. Under androgen excess, ovarian BMP4 expression was suppressed by activated
  AR. The negative regulation of androgen synthesis was then relieved as a result
  of down-regulated BMP4, leading to a further increase of androgen level. Accordingly,
  hyperandrogenism eventually developed.
