caption: The timeline and molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis. (A) Critical events
  in pyroptosis research. (B) Molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis. In the canonical
  pathway, upon stimulation with bacteria, viruses, or toxins, pattern recognition
  receptors on the cell surface activate downstream signaling pathways. Activated
  caspase-1 specifically cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) to produce GSDMD-N termini. The
  cleaved GSDMD-N fragment disrupts cell membrane integrity and induces cellular pyroptosis.
  In addition, activated caspase-1 promotes the production of mature IL-1β and IL-18,
  which induce an inflammatory response. Caspases-4/5/11 mainly mediate the noncanonical
  pathway of pyroptosis. Upon stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, activated
  caspases-4/5/11 specifically cleave GSDMD, leading to the formation of GSDMD pores
  that cause K+ efflux, thereby activating the NLRP3-caspase-1 signaling pathway and
  amplifying the inflammatory response. In addition, the formation of GSDMD pores
  is accompanied by Ca2+ efflux, which activates the calpain mechanism that promotes
  membrane rupture and the endosomal sorting complex required for the transport mechanism
  that promotes membrane repair. Various chemotherapeutic agents induce tumor cell
  pyroptosis by inducing the caspase-3-GSDME axis. Inhibition of TGF-β-activated kinase
  1 (TAK1) induces pyroptosis in mouse macrophages through the caspase-8-GSDMD pathway.
  In addition, during hypoxic conditions, TNF-α produced by macrophages induces cancer
  cell pyroptosis using the caspase-8-GSDMC pathway.
