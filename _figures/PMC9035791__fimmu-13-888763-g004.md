caption: Tools for targeting the IL-17/Th17 pathway in vasculitis. T-helper (Th) 17
  differentiation is a multi-step process with different cytokines involved. Their
  inhibitions could act on Th17 differentiation and modify the course of vasculitis.
  The first step of Th17 differentiation is mediated by interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-6.
  Inhibitors of IL-1ß (canakinumab, gevokizumab) or IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra)
  are available and some were tested in vasculitis. Inhibitors of IL-6 (sirukumab)
  or of its receptor (tocilizumab) were approved in selected giant-cell arteritis
  (GCA) patients. IL-6 inhibition also acts on the Th17/regulatory T cells (Treg)
  dysregulation that occurs in vasculitis. Another way to modulate the Th17/Treg balance
  is to use low-dose of IL-2. Receptor-related orphan receptor (RORc) inhibition also
  suppresses Th17 lineage. Then, IL-23 is required for Th17 differentiation and ustekinumab
  is an inhibitor of the IL-12/IL-23 axis, guselkumab specifically targets IL-23.
  Promising results in Behçet disease (BD) are described. After their differentiation,
  Th17 cells produce IL-17A which could be inhibited by secukinumab or ixekizumab.
  Bispecific antibodies against IL-17A/IL-17F are currently developing with bimekizumab.
  brodalumab is an IL-17 receptor antagonist. All biologics targeting directly the
  IL-17 pathway are represented but secukinumab was the only one tested in vasculitis.
