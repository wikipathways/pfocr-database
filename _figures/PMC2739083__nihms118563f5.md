caption: Predicted amino acid biosynthesis pathways in S. pneumoniae D39 based on
  genomic sequences (; ). Arrows are not scaled to reflect lengths of pathways. “X”
  indicates incomplete or missing pathway. “?” indicates a complete pathway that appears
  nonfunctional under tested conditions. D39 did not grow in CDM drop-out media lacking
  boxed amino acids. Relative transcript amounts for some biosynthesis genes increased
  (amino acids indicated with asterisks) or decreased (pound signs) upon mupirocin
  treatment (see text and , lines 1, 2, 9).
