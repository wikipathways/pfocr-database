caption: cGAS-STING signaling activation. DNA from microbial pathogens, damaged nuclei,
  or mitochondria binds and activates cGAS, and catalyzes the synthesis of cGAMP.
  cGAMP functions as a second messenger and binds to the ER-membrane adaptor STING
  and induces a conformational change that presumably results in the activation of
  STING. STING traffics from the ER to an ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and the
  Golgi apparatus, and then activates TBK1. TBK1 phosphorylates the transcription
  factor IRF3. STING also activates NF-kB, which enters the nucleus, where it functions
  together with IRF3 to induce the expression of type I IFNs and many other genes
  that mediate immune and inflammatory responses.
