caption: Regulation of MUC4 expression. A) Schematic of MUC4 promoter depicting the
  presence of various transcription factor binding sites AP-1, growth response element
  (GRE), hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α), STAT, retinoic acid receptor (RAR),
  SMAD, nuclear factor-κB (κB), retinoid receptor (RXR), and Sp1. The expression of
  MUC4 can be driven by an active proximal and a distal promoter region. The proximal
  promoter does not contain a TATA box, while it is present in the distal promoter
  region. B) Expression of MUC4 is transcriptionally regulated by a variety of growth
  factors, cytokines, and other components (IFNγ, RA, TGFβ, interleukins, and bile
  acids). IFNγ-induced expression of MUC4 is mediated by a novel mechanism that involves
  an up-regulation of STAT1. Retinoic acid-induced expression of MUC4 is mediated
  by TGFβ2. Induction of MUC4 expression by TGFβ occurs via both SMAD-dependent and
  -independent pathways. TGFβ-stimulation activates SMAD2/3, which in complex with
  SMAD4 gets translocated to the nucleus and facilitates the transcription of MUC4.
  In addition, TGFβ can drive MUC4 expression via MAPK, PI3K, and PKA pathways. Interleukins
  are known to regulate MUC4 expression via the STAT6 pathway in airway epithelial
  cells. Bile acids up-regulate MUC4 expression in esophageal cancer cells by involving
  the HNF1α transcription factor. RBP = retinoic acid binding protein; TCDC = taurochenodeoxycholate;
  TDC = taurodeoxycholate.
