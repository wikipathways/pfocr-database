caption: The hypothesized macro-mechanism by which phthalates induce hypospadias.
  Phthalates would initially impact the sex steroid pathway, which plays the dominant
  role. The impaired androgen signaling and enhanced estrogen signaling could influence
  the expression and activity of autophagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and EMT. ROS
  may act as an important mediator in this process, with abnormally elevated ROS participating
  in the regulation of various mechanisms through different pathways. (Solid arrows
  represent mechanisms that have been elucidated in the included study). Dashed arrows
  indicate mechanisms cited from related studies that were not included in this systematic
  review)
