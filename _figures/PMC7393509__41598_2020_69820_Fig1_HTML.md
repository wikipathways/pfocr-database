caption: Schematic of glycogen synthesis from exogenous [U-13C]fructose, unlabeled
  endogenous sources and hepatic glucose enriched with exogenous [U-13C]glucose. 13C-isotopomers
  of triose-P intermediates and glycogen originating from [U-13C]fructose are shown
  by red circles while glycogen 13C-isotopomers that originated via the Krebs cycle
  are shown as pink. Glycogen formed from hepatic glucose via the direct pathway is
  shown as yellow. Unlabeled glycogen and unlabeled precursors are represented by
  unfilled circles. For simplicity, some metabolic intermediates were omitted and
  only those 13C-isotopomers within the 456-triose moiety of glycogen are shown. The
  blue shading represents glycogen molecules that are enriched with 2H in positions
  2, 5 and 6s from 2H2O.
