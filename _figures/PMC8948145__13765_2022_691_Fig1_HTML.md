caption: A proposed biosynthetic pathway of of piperonal from 3,4-MDCA. It has been
  postulated that phenylalanine is converetd to 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamic acid (3,4-MDCA).
  The side chain of 3,4-MDCA was cleaved by a Piper nigrum hydratase/lyase (PnPNS)
  to generate piperonal. Vanilla planifolia vanillin synthase (VpVAN) converts ferulic
  acid to vanillin. The solid arrows denote the catalytic steps with a known mechanism,
  the dashed arrow denotes a proposed reaction
