caption: 'Proposed model of the role of KDM6A/B in definitive endoderm differentiation.
  At early stage of definitive endoderm differentiation from human embryonic stem
  cells, KDM6A/B demethylate H3K27me3 which leads to upregulation of WNT3 expression
  and activation of WNT signaling pathway, which further promotes mesendoderm differentiation.
  At late stage, KDM6A/B activates DKK1, a WNT antagonist, to suppress WNT signaling
  pathway and promote mesendoderm to endoderm differentiation. Arrow indicates activation
  and T-bar indicates inhibition. PP: pluripotent; MD: mesendoderm; ED: endoderm.'
