caption: The molecular gene targets, respective signaling pathways and molecule mediators
  associated with the biological responses was demonstrated in NF3-treated HUVEC at
  16 h. Yellow molecule represented differentially expressed genes identified from
  microarray analysis. Blue box represented the suggested signaling pathway. Purple
  box represented the molecular mediators. Green box represented the biological responses.
  + indicated as positive regulation and–indicated negative regulation.
