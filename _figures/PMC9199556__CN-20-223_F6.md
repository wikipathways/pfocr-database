caption: A model of central neural circuits regulated by the acute light exposure/circadian
  photoentrainment. The acute green/white light stimuli may be transmitted by the
  Brn3b+ ipRGCs→POA pathway to promote sleep and decrease Tcore, while the blue light
  may stimulate the Brn3b- ipRGCs→SCN pathway to promote wakefulness as well as emergence
  from general anesthesia. The circadian rhythm of Tcore and SWs may also be regulated
  by the Brn3b- ipRGCs→SCN pathway. The SCN neurons that co-express TRPV2 and PKR2
  are mutually innervated with the PKR2+ DRN neurons to regulate the circadian rhythm.
  The Ptgds+ SCN neurons may release thermoregulatory PGD2 to the POA to regulate
  the circadian oscillation of Tcore. The DRNVgat neurons inhibit the MPO neurons
  to modulate Tcore. Together with other regulatory circuits, different light signals
  are able to regulate Tcore, SWs and general anesthetic states (GAs). Full lines
  represent light-related/circadian projections and dotted line represents simplex
  thermoregulatory projection.
