caption: STAT3 suppresses EMT by promoting GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and proteasomal
  degradation of SNAI-1 in IEC. STAT3 inhibits phosphorylation of GSK3β (active),
  which phosphorylates SNAI-1, leading to ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently,
  epithelial cell markers, such as claudins, are upregulated and mesenchymal markers,
  such as vimentin and fibronectin, are down-regulated. When STAT3 is deleted from
  IEC, unknown environmental cue(s) induce phosphorylation of GSK3β (inactive), most
  likely via the Akt pathway, leading to accumulation of SNAI and EMT.
