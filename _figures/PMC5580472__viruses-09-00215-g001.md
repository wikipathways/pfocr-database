caption: Overview of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. (1) Tumor necrosis
  factor α (TNFα) or the Fas ligand (FasL) bind to the respective TNF-receptor (TNFR)-1
  or FasR receptors. Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) binds to the cytoplasmic
  region of FasR and forms a scaffold that recruits procaspase-8.For TNF, TNFR-associated
  death domain protein (TRADD) associates with the cytoplasmic death domain (DD) of
  the TNF-R1 and forms complex 1 which leads to nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation;
  (2) Alternatively, TNF can induce apoptosis when receptor-interacting protein 1
  (RIP1) forms a cytoplasmic complex II consisting of RIP1, FADD, and procaspase-8;
  (3) Procaspase-8 oligomerization results in its autocleavage and activation where
  the initiator caspase-8 activates (4) caspase-3 or cleave additional substrates
  such as (5) BH3 interacting-doain death agonist (Bid) to truncated (t)Bid; (6) tBid
  activates Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (Bak)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)
  oligomers in the mitochondria. Alternatively, Bak/Bax can form pores in the mitochondria
  outer membrane in response to Ca2+ efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or
  Golgi; (7) Bax/Bak pores result in mitochondria membrane permeabilization which
  leads to the subsequent release of cytochrome c and second mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein with low pI) (Smac/DIABLO,
  referred to as “Smac” in the illustration) from the inner membrane space of the
  mitochondria to the cytosol; (8) Cytoplasmic cytochrome c binds Apaf1 leading to
  the formation of the apoptosome and the activation of initiator caspase-9; (9) caspase-9
  in turn activates effector caspases such as caspase-3.Smac released form the mitochondria
  also binds inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) which allows caspase-3 to become
  active and cleave target proteins; (10) Effector caspases in turn cleave target
  proteins resulting in the activation of apoptosis. Poxvirus proteins are indicated
  in the open boxes. Red lines indicate points in the pathway inhibited by viral proteins.
  Vaccinia virus (VACV) F1, Myxoma virus (MYXV) M11, MYXV M131, Shope Fibroma Virus
  (SFV) S131, and Molluscum Contagiosum Virus (MCV) MC163 localize to the mitochondria
  where these proteins antagonize mitochondria mediated responses in the intrinsic
  apoptotic pathway. MYXV M131/SFV S131 are depicted interacting with cellular copper
  chaperones for superoxide dismutase (CCS).
