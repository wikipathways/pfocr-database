caption: Non-canonical activation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. Growth factor
  binding to their receptors activates two prominent oncogenic pathways, the phosphortidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In addition
  to the canonical activation, Gli1 can be activated by S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)-mediated
  phosphorylation at Serine 84, leading to nuclear translocation and induction of
  gene transcription. Gli1 can also be activated by ERK, probably through phosphorylation
  of its N-terminus by ERK2. Gli2 activity can be regulated by the MAPK pathway through
  increasing its stability. In addition, the MAPK pathway can activate the Shh pathway
  by inducing Shh expression through transcriptional upregulation. Gli1 can reciprocally
  activate the PI3K pathway indirectly by inducing Bmi1 expression, which represses
  PTEN expression. Crosstalk between the Shh and other oncogenic pathways regulates
  a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, cell cycle progress,
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cell motility and invasiveness, and cancer
  stem cell (CSC) self-renewal.
