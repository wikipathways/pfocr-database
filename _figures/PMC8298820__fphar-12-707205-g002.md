caption: Schematic diagram of the molecular mechanisms of GA in treating COVID-19.
  (1) GA promotes the proliferation of T cells and has Th1 cell immune adjuvant activity.
  (2) GA inhibits the production of IL-6 and the activation of NF-κB. (3) GA inhibits
  the activity of HMGB1 and the signal transduction of the HMGB1-TLR4 pathway. (4)
  GA induces the apoptosis of host cells latent with SARS-CoV-2. (5) GA stimulates
  macrophages to produce NO. (6) GA inhibits the inflammatory response induced by
  LPS. (7) GA prevents the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the domain of lipid
  rafts.
