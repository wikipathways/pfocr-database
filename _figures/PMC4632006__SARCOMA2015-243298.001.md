caption: 'Left: the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is mainly activated by nutrients (not shown)
  and growth factors, binding to receptor tyrosine kinases and activating PI3K. As
  PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) is converted to PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate), PDK1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 1) phosphorylates
  AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1) upon PIP3-mediated recruitment
  to the plasma membrane. AKT1 inhibits TSC1/2 (tuberous sclerosis 1/2), relieving
  the inhibition of Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which activates mTOR. The
  recruitment of Raptor (regulatory associated protein of MTOR, complex 1), Deptor
  (DEP domain containing MTOR-interacting protein), and GβL (mLST8; G protein beta
  subunit-like MTOR associated protein, LST8 homolog) gives rise to the mTOR complex
  1 (mTORC1). Upon activation of S6K1 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1) and inhibition
  of 4EBP-1 (EIF4EBP1; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein
  1), protein translation is stimulated by activation of ribosomal protein S6 and
  eIF4B and E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B and E). Additionally, AKT1
  activates β-catenin signaling. Middle: BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling
  is modulated through binding of BMPs to BMPR1 and BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein
  receptor type I/II) and the coreceptor endoglin, activating Smad1/5/8 and leading
  to transcription of target genes involved in angiogenesis and proliferation. Endoglin
  may also activate PI3K/AKT signaling. Right: canonical Wnt signaling is activated
  by binding of Wnt to the Frizzled receptor and the LRP (low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein) coreceptor. Upon recruitment of Dsh (dishevelled) and
  Axin to the plasma membrane, the β-catenin destruction complex, which contains Axin,
  APC (adenomatosis polyposis coli), GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), and CKI (casein
  kinase 1), is inactivated, leading to β-catenin accumulation and transcription of
  target genes after association with TCF/LEF (transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor). Noncanonical signaling plays a role in cell migration, invasion, and cytoskeleton
  arrangement and is mediated through binding of Wnt to Frizzled and other coreceptors
  such as ROR2 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2) or without coreceptors.'
