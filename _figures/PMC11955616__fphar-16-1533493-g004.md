caption: Function and Regulatory Mechanisms of the RIG-I Signaling Pathway in Lung
  Cancer (By figdraw). Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and its homolog MDA5
  recognize viral RNA or endogenous abnormal RNA,Upon activation, MAVS phosphorylates
  interferon regulatory factors IRF3/IRF7 and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) through TBK1
  (TANK-binding kinase 1) and the IKK (IκB kinase) complex, respectively. Once phosphorylated,
  IRF3/7 translocates into the nucleus to induce the transcription of type I interferons
  (IFN-α/β), while NF-κB promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In lung
  cancer, abnormal regulation of this pathway is closely associated with tumor malignancy
  and the response to immunotherapy. Specifically, circNDUFB2 can act as a ligand
  for RIG-I, activating the RIG-I-MAVS signaling axis, enhancing immune cell infiltration,
  and exerting anti-tumor effects
