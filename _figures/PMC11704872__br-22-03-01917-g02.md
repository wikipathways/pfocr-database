caption: Inhibition of autophagy by the IGF-1 signaling pathway. The interaction of
  IGF-1 with its receptor IGF-1R initiates a sophisticated signaling cascade. In the
  initial phase, IRS1/2 phosphorylation occurs, subsequently activating downstream
  pathways, including PI3K, AKT and S6K. PI3K activates the lipid molecules PIP2 and
  PIP3, with PIP3 further activating PDK1. Activated PDK1 then phosphorylates and
  activates AKT. This phosphorylation inhibits TSC1/TSC2 and GSK-3β, preventing their
  interaction with Rheb, thereby activating mTORC1. Activated mTORC1 stimulates S6K,
  which reduces the number of autophagolysosome and inhibits 4EBP1, a translational
  regulator, thereby enhancing protein synthesis. Furthermore, mTORC1-mediated inhibition
  of ULK1/2 decreased autophagosome synthesis. IGF-1 also activates the MAPK signaling
  pathway, which includes She, Ras, Raf and ERK1/2. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2
  promotes cell survival by activating mTORC1 within the nucleus. IGF-1, insulin-like
  growth factor 1; IRS1/2, insulin receptor substrate 1 and 2; S6K, ribosomal S6 kinase;
