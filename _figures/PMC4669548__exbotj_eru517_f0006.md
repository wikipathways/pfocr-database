caption: Overview of the major metabolic changes in response to B. cinerea infection
  in V. vinifera grapes at EL33 and EL35. Activation (+ shading in key) and inhibition
  (– shading in key) of the pathway as suggested by microarray data and increased
  content of metabolites at high and moderate levels are indicated. Ovals and hexagons
  represent metabolites and pathways, respectively. The expression profile of each
  individual gene and metabolite content is presented in Supplementary Fig. S8A and
  B for selected pathways. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)
