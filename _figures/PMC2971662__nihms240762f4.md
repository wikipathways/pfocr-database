caption: The core PYR/PYL —| PP2C —| SnRK2 signaling pathway. In the absence of ABA,
  PP2C activity is high, and the PP2Cs prevent accumulation of phosphorylated SnRK2
  kinases by directly dephosphorylating them. In the presence of ABA, PYR/PYL proteins
  bind to and inhibit PP2Cs, which leads to the accumulation of phosphorylated and
  active SnRK2s, possibly by auto-phosphorylation, however this is not currently clear.
  Once activated by phosphorylation, the SnRK2s can then directly phosphorylate downstream
  targets, such as the ABFs, SLAC, KAT1, and probably other proteins. Phosphorylation
  of ABFs is necessary for their ability to activate transcription. OST1 stimulates
  SLAC channel activity in Xenopus experiments and has been hypothesized to inhibit
  KAT1 channel activity.
