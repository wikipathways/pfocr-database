caption: Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway. Patched 1 homolog (PTCH1) is activated either
  by binding of SHH ligand from a signaling cell or by intrinsic mutation, leading
  to relocalization of Smoothened (SMO) from the cell membrane. This activation results
  in signaling through Costal, COS, and suppressor of fused homolog (SuFu) and subsequent
  activation of GLI 1/2 transcription factors. Activated GLI transcription factors,
  which translocate to the nucleus, upregulate some genes—including cyclin-dependent
  kinases D and E (cyclin D and E); hedgehog-interacting protein (HIP), insulin-like
  growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) and other IGFBPs, hairy and enhancer of
  split 1 (Hes1), sclerosin domain-containing 1 (Sostdc), phosphatidic acid phosphatase
  type 2B (Ppap2b), and bone morphogenic protein (BMP)—and downregulate others, including
  BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (Bambi) and secreted frizzle-related protein
  1–2 (Sfrp1-2). Upregulation of IGFBP-2 presumably results in an increase in IGFBP-2
  expression in K14+ cells and in secretion of IGFBP-2 into the extracellular space
  around K14+ cells.
