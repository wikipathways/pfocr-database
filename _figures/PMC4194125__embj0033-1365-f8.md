caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating metabolites of the glycolytic pathway and
  the TCA cycle that are altered by ARRB1. In red are metabolites or genes showing
  increased concentration or expression, respectively, in nucARRB1; in blue are those
  with lower concentration or expression, respectively. Reductive carboxylation pathway
  of glutamine is indicated in green.Modulation of HIF1A signalling by ARRB1 occurs
  at two levels: (i) ARRB1 indirectly alters expression levels of metabolic enzymes
  FH and SDHA, resulting in accumulation of oncometabolites fumarate and succinate
  and pseudohypoxic stabilisation of HIF1A, and (ii) ARRB1 acts as a co-factor of
  HIF1A to enhance its transcriptional activity both in normoxic and hypoxic conditions.'
