caption: (A) The cell cycle pathway was dysregulated by ncRNAs and coding genes. Only
  the representative component of this pathway is shown. The hypermthylated genes
  are marked in red, and the hypomethylated genes are marked in green. The aberrant
  methylation patterns are labeled on the edge of the rectangle. The experimentally
  validated miRNA-mediated regulations from TarBase and adjacent lncRNAs with common
  aberrant methylation patterns were linked. (B) The MAPK signalling pathway. Only
  the representative component of this pathway is shown. (C) A model illustrating
  the dysregulated cellular network intertwined by ncRNAs and coding genes, ncRNA
  and coding genes cooperatively mediate the pathway dysregulation.
