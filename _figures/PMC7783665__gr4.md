caption: Calcineurin activation by cAMP/PKA and interaction with CaM for cell secretion.
  (A) Activation of a CnA-like phosphatase activity by cAMP/PKA has been shown to
  enhance the release of von Willibrand factor (vWF) from Weibel-Palade bodies (WPB).
  The complex formed between S100A10 and Annexin A2 (AnxA2) by dephosphorylation of
  AnxA2 affects this. Notably, this cAMP/PKA activity is likely to work through the
  activation of CnA phosphatase in regulating AnxA2 and S100A10 complex formation.
  In the past, S100A10 and AnxA2 have also been shown to aid cell secretion interaction
  by interacting with CFTR. (B) Ca2+/CaM also activates CnA in a different pathway
  regulated by Ca2+ levels. These pathways (cAMP/PKA- and CaM-dependent activation
  of CnA) may all be working in concert in order to aid cell secretion.
