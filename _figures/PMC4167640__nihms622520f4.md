caption: YAP and TAZ regulate several cellular properties that are important for the
  development of cancer and the regulation of stem cell behavior and regeneration.
  Some of these, such as the promotion of stemness and proliferation are important
  for cancer development and in regeneration, while others such as the regulation
  of EMT may be important only for the development of cancer. However, the function
  of YAP and TAZ in reprogramming mature and differentiated cells during regenerative
  behavior may be exploited during the development of cancer and help drive EMT and
  other phenotypes.
