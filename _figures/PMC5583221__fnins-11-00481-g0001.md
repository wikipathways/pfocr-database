caption: Mechanism of axon degeneration and sites of action of chemotherapeutic drugs.
  Axon degeneration is determined by factors that can either enhance death and/or
  inhibit survival pathways. Key mechanisms that underlie this pathway are transcriptional
  programs, microtubule-dependent transport, local translation to modulate mitochondrial
  function, and proteolysis. Chemotherapeutic agents (illustrated by colored skull
  and cross bones) that are currently known to modulate these key mechanisms are depicted
  (see text for detail). (1) During developmental axon pruning, target-derived neurotrophins
  instruct transcription of key pro-survival genes (Bclw). Under neurotrophic deprivation,
  the function of pro-survival genes is overcome by induction of pro-death genes (Puma).
  (2) Key transcripts of neurotrophin-dependent retrograde response genes (Bclw) are
  transported in an anterograde manner by kinesin motor proteins toward distal axons.
  Cell soma-derived factors (NMNAT2) are also transported to axons to replenish axonal
  pools of proteins with fast turnover rate. (3) Local translation of Bclw and LaminB2
  (not shown) modulates mitochondrial function to inhibit the caspase cascade. Mitochondrial
  and ER integrity is also critical for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis to prevent activation
  of Ca2+-dependent calpains. (4) Neurotrophic deprivation leads to degradation of
  XIAP, a key inhibitor of the caspase cascade. NMNAT2, a survival factor with a short
  half-life, is possibly degraded through the proteasome in axons. (5) Vincristine
  and axotomy activates SARM1 and DLK/MAPK signaling, leading to activation of calpains,
  the ultimate convergence point for executing axon degeneration. Expression of Wlds,
  axonal NMNAT1, or NMN deaminase provides protection against vincristine or injury-induced
  degeneration. (6) Non neuron-autonomous effects from other cell types can potentially
  sensitize axons to degeneration during CIPN. Paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity can
  mediate inflammatory response and epithelial damage to perturb skin homeostasis.
