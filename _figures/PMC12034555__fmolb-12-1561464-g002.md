caption: 'This figure shows the role of EV-associated proteins in TNBC progression
  through various molecular interactions: 1. EGFR-EVs: promoting tumour growth and
  metastasis through dendritic cells and cytokines. EGFR activates the PI3K-AKT pathway,
  upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to tumour invasion, metastasis,
  and angiogenesis. Additionally, EGFR also activates the Ras/MAPK pathway, increasing
  MMP activity, resulting in ECM degradation and tumour progression. 2. CSF1-EVs:
  target tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), stimulating their activity and enhancing
  tumour progression. 3. CCL5-EVs enhance the function of MDSCs and CAFs. MDSCs suppress
  T cell/NK cell activity, leading to immune evasion, while CAFs promote angiogenesis.
  4. CD24-EVs: Suppress immune response by interacting with Siglec-10 on macrophages,
  thereby helping TNBC cells escape immune surveillance. 5. ADAM10-EVs: Regulate cell
  proliferation and adhesion by targeting Notch-1 and CD44 receptors, which contribute
  to tumour progression. 6. Cofilin-1-EV: Enhances tumour metastasis, further increasing
  the aggressiveness of TNBC'
