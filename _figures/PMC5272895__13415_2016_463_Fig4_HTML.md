caption: '(a) The simplest Cognitive-Emotional-Motor (CogEM) model: Three types of
  interacting representations (sensory, S; drive, D; and motor, M) that control three
  types of learning (conditioned reinforcer, incentive motivational, and motor) help
  to explain many reinforcement learning data. (b) In order to work well, a sensory
  representation S must have (at least) two successive stages, S(1) and S(2), so that
  sensory events cannot release actions that are motivationally inappropriate. The
  two successive stages of a sensory representation S are interpreted to be in the
  appropriate sensory cortex (corresponds to S(1)) and the prefrontal cortex, notably
  the orbitofrontal cortex (corresponds to S(2)). The prefrontal stage requires motivational
  support from a drive representation D such as amygdala, to be fully effective, in
  the form of feedback from the incentive motivational learning pathway. Amydgala
  inputs to prefrontal cortex cause feedback from prefrontal cortex to sensory cortex
  that selectively amplifies and focuses attention upon motivationally relevant sensory
  events, and thereby “attentionally blocks” irrelevant cues. [Reprinted with permission
  from Grossberg and Seidman ().] (c) The amygdala and basal ganglia work together,
  embodying complementary functions, to provide motivational support, focus attention,
  and release contextually appropriate actions to achieve valued goals. For example,
  the basal ganglia substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) releases Now Print learning
  signals in response to unexpected rewards or punishments, whereas the amygdala generates
  incentive motivational signals that support the attainment of expected valued goal
  objects. The MOTIVATOR model circuit diagram shows cognitive-emotional interactions
  between higher-order sensory cortices and an evaluative neuraxis composed of the
  hypothalamus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and orbitofrontal cortex [Reprinted with
