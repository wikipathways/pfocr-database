caption: Oncogenic signalling and nutrient availability influence cell metabolism.
  Oncogenic signalling regulates the acquisition of abundant nutrients including glucose
  and glutamine, and their utilization to support biosynthetic pathways (purple).
  Mutations in oncoproteins (green) lead to increased glucose uptake coupled to enhanced
  lactate production through the Warburg effect. Additionally, KRas and Myc promote
  glutamine metabolism to fuel the TCA cycle. Intermediates from glycolysis and the
  TCA cycle supply biosynthetic pathways to produce macromolecules necessary for cell
  proliferation. Tumour suppressors (red) such as LKB1, AMPK and p53 act at various
  nodes to oppose biosynthetic metabolism. Important nutrient transporters, transcription
  factors, and metabolic enzymes are highlighted in blue. Classic metabolic pathways
  are highlighted in orange. HK, hexokinase; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate
