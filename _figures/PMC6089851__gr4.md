caption: Therapeutic potential in cancers that are resistant to MEK and BRAF inhibitors.
  Resistance to BRAF inhibitors can occur through various mechanisms, including activating
  BRAF mutations and BRAF amplification, which can be overcome by both MEK inhibitors
  (MEKi) and ERK inhibitors (ERKi). ERK inhibitors have the advantage to further overcome
  resistance to MEK inhibitors that occurs upon MEK mutation.
