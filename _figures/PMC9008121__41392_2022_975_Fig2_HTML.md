caption: Mechanisms of therapy resistance mediated by ncRNAs. Examples of the common
  mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy,
  radiation, and immune checkpoint inhibitors mediated by miRNAs, lncRNAs, or circRNAs.
  The common mechanisms include (1) modulation of defending intrinsic pathways against
  the xenobiotics, e.g., miR-27a directly binds to SLC7A11 and decreases the glutathione
  (GSH), which binds cisplatin and detoxifies the intracellular environment, thus
  a decrease of miR-27a is responsible for cisplatin resistance; (2) promoting survival
  signaling pathways, e.g., lncARSR, which is packed by hnRNPA2B1 and then binds to
  miR-34a and miR-449, indirectly upregulates AXL and c-MET to contribute to sunitinib
  resistance; MIR100HG and its embedded miRNAs, miR-100 and miR-125b, mediate cetuximab
  resistance by activating Wnt signaling; circRNA-SORE directly binds to oncogenic
  protein YBX1 and prolongs its half-life by blocking its transfer into the nucleus,
  where it is degraded by PRP19 to trigger sorafenib resistance; (3) accelerating
  DNA damage repair, e.g., miR-410 inhibits the translation of PTEN, leading to the
  activation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling and accelerating DNA damage repair to induce
  radiotherapy resistance; circAKT3 inhibits miR-198, which in turn activates the
  PI3K/AKT signaling and triggers cisplatin resistance; (4) inducing genomic instability,
  e.g., lncRNA CCAT2 binds with BOP1 and AURKB to induce chromosomal instability (CIN)
  and resistance to 5-flurouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin; (5) inhibition of cell apoptosis
  or autophagy, e.g., miR-541 targets Ras-related protein RAB1B and autophagy-related
  gene 2 A (ATG2A), inhibiting autophagy, and further accelerates sorafenib resistance;
  (6) regulating cell metabolism, e.g., MACC1-AS1 binds and inhibits miR-145-5p, derepressing
  to key elements (CPT1 and ACS) of the fatty acid oxidation pathway, leading to resistance
  to the FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen; and (7) tuning the infiltrated immune cells,
  including T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and natural killer
  cells in the tumor immune microenvironment, e.g., circMET sponges miR-30-5p and
  indirectly inhibits the chemotactic molecule CXCL10, hence blocking CD8+ immune
  cell trafficking; LINK-A facilitates the degradation of TP53 and Rb, thus decreasing
  the number of CD8+ T cells and granzyme B NK cells; circUHRF1 binds and inhibits
  miR-449c-5p, upregulating TIM-3, to inhibit NK cell function; and miR-146a, miR-155,
  miR-125b, miR-100, let-7e, miR-125a, miR-146b, and miR-99b are released by melanoma
  cells via extracellular vesicles and internalized into myeloid cells to drive MDSC
  differentiation.
