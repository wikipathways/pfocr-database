caption: The niche for normal and cancer skin stem cells. The illustration delineates
  the distinguishing characteristics between niche factors supporting normal SSC and
  skin CSC. The intricate and heterogeneous nature of the skin CSC niche is depicted
  through five primary features. 1 Epidermal homeostasis is disrupted by the redistribution
  of integrins (α6β4 and α3β1), resulting in elevated suprabasal integrin levels,
  and dysregulated maturation of LM332, which presents as unprocessed LM332, remaining
  the LG4–5 domain and full length of the β3 chain, or its subunit γ2 fragments. The
  Notch signaling pathway can become dysfunctional, in which Notch is downregulated,
  leading to the release of its inhibitory effects on stem cell proliferation, thereby
  inducing skin tumorigenesis. However, Notch1 and its ligands, DLL1 and JAG1/2, are
  highly expressed in tumor cells during skin cancer metastasis. These opposing functions
  of Notch signaling may be associated with the ectopic presence of DLL1 in tumor
  cells, which are typically confined to the SSCs of the epidermal basal layer, and
  increased expression of JAG1/2. Additionally, alterations in the affinity of Notch1
  receptor for its ligands could further contribute to this complexity. This may result
  from reduced LFNG expression, which reinforces DLL1-Notch cis-inhibition (indicated
  by the light grey arrow) and inhibits JAG-Notch cis-inhibition in the physiological
  SSC niche (indicated by the light grey line), in progressive tumors. 2 Disruption
  of basement membrane integrity occurs through uncoupling of integrin from unprocessed
  LM332, breakdown of cadherin-mediated adhesion during EMT, and impairment of collagen
  IV, possibly induced by MMPs or miRNA-135b. Elevated MMP activity is sustained by
  CSCs, dysfunctional ECM proteins, and malignant cellular compartments, including
  CAFs, TAMs and TANs. The enhanced stiffness of the dermal matrix prompts the aberrant
  expression of integrins, which contribute to sustaining the stemness of CSCs. 3 Factors
  secreted by CSCs and tumor-associated cells, particularly CAFs, TANs, and TAMs,
  include molecules like VEGF and MMPs, which promote angiogenesis. 4 The continuous
  conversion of fibroblasts, monocytes, and neutrophils into CAFs, TAMs, and TANs,
  respectively, is imperative for maintaining the CSC niche. Concurrently, factors
  secreted by CSCs, fibrous ECM, and hypoxic conditions perpetuate the malignant traits
  of fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils. Additionally, the transition from
  E-cadherin to N-cadherin in adherens junctions, driven by the increased expression
  of SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST1, ZEB1/2, SIP1, and TCF3, as well as secreted factors from
  CSCs or tumor-associated cells like TGF-β, promotes metastasis and facilitates the
  recruitment of CAFs into the CSC niche. 5 The CSC niche sustains the survival of
  CSCs and tumor cells through multiple mechanisms. Cellular constituents within the
  CSC niche, including CAFs, TAMs, TANs, and Tregs, orchestrate an immunosuppressive
  TME, thereby inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function. Notably, soluble factors secreted
  by these immunosuppressive cells and CSCs, such as IL-10, CCL12, CXCR2 and IL-1β,
  promote Treg accumulation within the CSC niche and upregulate the expression of
  PD-1 and PD-L1 in both CSCs and tumor cells. CAFs can impair T cell function and
  increase T cell apoptosis by binding their FASL and PD-L1/2 to FAS and PD-1 receptors
  on T cells. CSCs further contribute to immune evasion by elevating PD-1 expression
  and downregulating MHC I/II expression on their surfaces. Endothelial cells (ECs)
  not only facilitate angiogenesis to nourish the CSC niche but also promote skin
  cancer metastasis through interactions with adhesive proteins on CSCs. SC, Stem
