caption: In healthy persons (Panel A), the lamina propria normally contains a diverse
  array of immune cells and secreted cytokines. These include antiinflammatory mediators
  (transforming growth factor β [TGF-β] and interleukin-10) that down-regulate immune
  responses, as well as proinflammatory mediators from both innate and adaptive immune
  cells that limit excessive entry of intestinal microbiota and defend against pathogens.
  Noninflammatory defenses, such as phagocytosis by macrophages, probably assist in
  defending against bacteria entering the lamina propria while minimizing tissue injury.
  A homeostatic balance is maintained between regulatory T cells (e.g., Treg) and
  effector T cells (Th1, Th2, and Th17). In persons with intestinal inflammation (Panel
  B), several events contribute to increased bacterial exposure, including disruption
  of the mucus layer, dysregulation of epithelial tight junctions, increased intestinal
  permeability, and increased bacterial adherence to epithelial cells. In inflammatory
  bowel disease, innate cells produce increased levels of tumor necrosis factor α
  (TNF-α), interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interleukin-12, interleukin-23, and chemokines.
  There is marked expansion of the lamina propria, with increased numbers of CD4+
  T cells, especially proinflammatory T-cell subgroups, which also secrete increased
  levels of cytokines and chemokines. Increased production of chemokines results in
  recruitment of additional leukocytes, resulting in a cycle of inflammation. At present,
  therapeutic approaches to inflammatory bowel disease (labels in red) focus on inhibiting
  proinflammatory cytokines, inhibiting the entry of cells into intestinal tissues
  (dashed arrow), and inhibiting T-cell activation and proliferation. Additional investigational
  biologic therapies include blockade of costimulatory signals that enhance interactions
  between innate cells and adaptive cells, administration of epithelial growth factors,
  and enhancement of tolerance through a variety of mechanisms. CD4+ Th17 cells (inset)
  express surface molecules such as the interleukin-23 receptor (a component of the
  interleukin-23–receptor complex, which consists of the interleukin-23 receptor and
  the interleukin-12 receptor B1) and CCR6. Interleukin-23 (comprising subunits p19
  and p40) is secreted by antigen-presenting cells, and engagement of interleukin-23
  with the interleukin-23–receptor complex results in activation of the Janus-associated
  kinase (JAK2) signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3), thereby
  regulating transcriptional activation. Interleukin-23 contributes to Th17-cell proliferation,
  survival, or both, and its actions are enhanced by tumor necrosis factor (ligand)
  superfamily, member 15 (TNFS15). Of the top 30 genetic associations with Crohn’s
  disease, at least six genes can be implicated in Th17 cells and interleukin-23 signaling.
  A number of these genes are not unique to interleukin-23–Th17 signaling. Genes in
  the interleukin-23–Th17 pathway that have been associated with Crohn’s disease are
  designated by red stars, and those with ulcerative colitis by blue stars.
