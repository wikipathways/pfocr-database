caption: Mechanism of HER2 targeted drugs and EGFR family in breast cancer. Trastuzumab,
  pertuzumab and TDM-1 bind to the juxtamembrane domain of HER2. Lapatinib is reversible
  TKI of HER1 and HER2, while neratinib and pyrotinib are irreversible HER 1, 2 and
  4 inhibitors. These drugs inhibit downstream signals of EGFR family, especially
  PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathway, improving proliferation, survival, migration, angiogenesis,
  drug resistance and suppressing apoptosis of cancer cells.
