caption: '(A) Simplified schematic of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)
  pathway. The ligand TGF-β (GeneCards ID: TGFB), binds its heterodimeric receptor
  (GeneCards ID: TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), resulting in the downstream activation of the
  signal transducing and transcriptional modulating SMAD cascade (GeneCards IDs: SMAD2,
  3, and 4), subsequently followed by the transcriptional upregulation of SMAD-dependent
  genes. The TGF-β pathway-activating ligand is labelled in green, while the TGF-β
  pathway inhibiting pharmaceutical (RepSox) is labelled in red. (B) Simplified schematic
  of the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) pathway. The ligand TNF-α (GeneCards
  ID: TNF) binds its trimeric receptor, consisting of tumor necrosis factor receptor
  superfamily members 1A and 1B proteins (GeneCards IDs: TNFRSF1A or TNFRSF1B), resulting
  in the downstream phosphorylation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of
  α/IKK-α (GeneCards ID: CHUK), β/IKK-β (GeneCards ID: IKBKB), and γ/IKK-γ (GeneCards
  ID: IKBKG). The IKK complex then activates the NF-κβ protein complex consisting
  of IκΒα/ nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor,
  alpha (GeneCards ID: NFKBIA), p50/ Nuclear Factor NF-Kappa-B P50 Subunit (GeneCards
  ID: NFKB1), and p65/Nuclear Factor NF-Kappa-B P65 Subunit (GeneCards ID: RELA),
  through phosphorylation and release of IκΒα. The liberated p50/65 complex then transports
  to the nucleus followed by the transcriptional upregulation of proinflammatory target
  genes. The TNF-α pathway-activating ligand is labelled in green, while the TNF-α
  pathway inhibiting pharmaceutical (BAY11–7082) is labelled in red. (C) Simplified
  schematic of p53 pathway activation induced by Nutlin-3. Nutlin-3 selectively inhibits
  the interaction between the ubiquitin-protein ligase called mouse double minute
  2 (MDM2) homolog (GeneCard ID: MDM2), and tumor protein p53 (GeneCard ID: TP53),
  resulting in p53 pathway activation. The p53 pathway inhibiting pharmaceutical (Nutlin-3)
  is labelled in red.'
