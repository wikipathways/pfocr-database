caption: 'Nitrogen cycle activity in the WSP adapted from the Bernhard [] schematic.
  Arrows indicate direction of reaction. Genes associated with nitrogen-cycling pathways
  include as follows: nrfA, DNRA (dissimilatory NO3 reduction to NH3); nosZ, denitrification;
  hszA, anammox; nifH, nitrogen fixation; AamoA and BamoA, ammonia oxidation; nxrB,
  nitrite oxidation. The dotted line indicates the interface between the high and
  low oxygen environments needed for each pathway'
