caption: 'Classical model of G1–S transition regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent
  kinases (CDK). The cyclin D–CDK4/6 complex can be activated through Janus kinase–signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)–protein kinase B (AKT), and Ras–Raf–extracellular signal-regulated protein
  kinases (ERK) signalling pathways, and is regulated by P16INK4A inhibition. Furthermore,
  CDK inactivation can be mediated through P21CIP1 via the P53 signalling pathway.
  Generally, inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 leads to lower phosphorylation of retinoblastoma
  (RB), which in turn inhibits the expression of early region 2 (E2F) target genes.
  CDK2 is activated in the G1 phase with a rise in late-stage E-type cyclin levels,
  leading to overphosphorylation and deactivation of RB. Overphosphorylated RB is
  released from E2F, resulting in increased transcription of E2F target genes, which
  is necessary for the cell to enter the S phase. mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin;
  TGF: transforming growth factor'
