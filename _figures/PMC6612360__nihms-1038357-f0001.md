caption: In aged endothelial cells increased levels of ROS generated by NOX oxidases
  (stimulated by elevated TNFα levels and/or by the activated local renin-angiotensin
  system [RAS] in the vascular wall) and mitochondria decrease the bioavailability
  of NO by forming ONOO-. Lack of NO leads to vasodilator dysfunction, whereas nitrative
  stress leads to PARP-1 activation, which contributes to NAD+ depletion. Impaired
  activity of NAD+ dependent pro-survival factor SIRT1 and the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant
  defense pathway exacerbates vascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction
  in aging. The model predicts that in addition to these cell-autonomous mechanisms
  age-related deficiency of circulating IGF-1 and other vasoprotective factors confers
  pro-oxidative vascular effects in aging.
