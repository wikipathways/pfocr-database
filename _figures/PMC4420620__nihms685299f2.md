caption: a| The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) anti-apoptotic protein
  viral FLICE-like inhibitory protein (vFLIP) activates nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB)
  signalling by targeting NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO), which is a central regulatory
  subunit of the upstream inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK) complex. Following
  stimulation by extracellular stress signals or viral pathogens, the IKK complex
  is activated and phosphorylates IκBs, which leads to their proteosomal degradation
  and the release of NF-κB dimers. Binding of KSHV vFLIP to NEMO induces and stabilizes
  a conformational change in the host protein that enables the recruitment of IKKα
  and IKKβ and the continuous activation of NF-κB. NF-κB induces the expression of
  inflammatory, proliferative and anti-apoptosis genes, including the gene that encodes
  A20. A20 binds to vFLIP and blocks vFLIP-induced NF-κB activation, which generates
  a negative feedback loop. In addition, expression of vFLIP enhances the phophorylation
  of NEMO at Y374 and S377, which negatively regulates its function. The dual regulation
  of NF-κB signalling by vFLIP suggests that the virus modulates this pathway to promote
  survival. b| KSHV encodes a cluster of four viral homologues of interferon (IFN)
  regulatory factors (IRFs) (vIRF1–4). In addition to suppressing p53-mediated apoptosis,
  vIRFs also function as negative regulators of type I IFN responses. Transcription
  of type I IFNα and IFNβ following viral infection is primarily controlled by IRF3
  and IRF7. Cytoplasmic IRF3 and IRF7 undergo phosphorylation, homodimerization and
  heterodimerization, followed by nuclear translocation to induce the expression of
  type I IFNs. Binding of IFNs to the type I IFN receptor (IFNR) induces the expression
  of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which initiate an intracellular antiviral programme
  to restrict viral replication and spread. Both vIRF1 and vIRF2 inhibit IRF3-mediated
  transcriptional activation and the production of IFNβ, whereas vIRF2 can also inhibit
  IFNα-induced induction of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)-containing genes.
  vIRF3 specifically interacts with, and inhibits, IRF7 and thereby abrogates the
  production of IFNα and IFN-mediated immunity. vIRF4 is an inhibitor of IRF4, which
  unlike other vIRFs, mainly inhibits IRF4-mediated expression of the proto-oncogene
  c-MYC to facilitate viral lytic replication and/or reactivation. ISGF3, IFN-stimulated
  gene factor 3; JAK, Janus kinase; TYK2, non-receptor tyrosine kinase 2.
