caption: A proposed model of VSV-obatoclax synergism. In CLL cells, the proapoptotic
  activity of BAX and BAK are inhibited via association with antiapoptotic BCL-2 and
  MCL-1, respectively. obatoclax15-070 occupies the BH-3-binding groove of prosurvival
  BCL-2 and MCL-1 to disrupt BCL-2/BAX and MCL-1/BAK heterodimers, thus restoring
  the ability of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to respond to VSV apoptotic stimuli.
  In response to VSV infection, the BH-3-only protein NOXA is induced at the transcriptional
  level, additionally contributing to the abrogation of MCL-1/BAK complexes. Activated
  NOXA protein may also directly induce a conformational change in BAX that subsequently
  promotes translocation to the mitochondria outer membrane. The VSV-obatoclax combination
  therapy leads to the activation and oligomerization of BAX and BAK homo- and heterodimers
  and thus membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c formation of the apoptosome and
  activation of the caspase cascade. BCL, B-cell lymphoma-2; CLL, chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia; MCL, myeloid cell leukemia-1; Obato., obatoclax; VSV, vesicular stomatitis
  virus.
