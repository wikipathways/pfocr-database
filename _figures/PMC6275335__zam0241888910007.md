caption: Proposed pathway for the complete utilization of carbaryl as the carbon and
  nitrogen source in Pseudomonas sp. strain C5pp. The genes are depicted in italics.
  The measured specific activity (nmol·min−1·mg−1) for various enzymes is shown in
  the box. An asterisk indicates that the relative expression of genes was monitored
  from carbaryl-grown Pseudomonas sp. strain C5pp cells. Dashed and dotted lines represent
  the possible routes for methylamine oxidation and formaldehyde detoxification in
  Pseudomonas sp. strain C5pp.
