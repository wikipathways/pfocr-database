caption: Signaling pathway mediating role of the TN/TX microRNA-degrading enzyme in
  regulating aortic stiffness. Schematic diagram integrates results obtained in both
  in vitro and in vivo studies examining the role of TN/TX and miR-181b in mediating
  VSMC and aortic stiffness. In this model, aging or AVP stimulation elicit activation
  of TN/TX which cleaves pre-miR-181b, the precursor of mature miR-181b. Degradation
  of pre-miR-181b prevents Dicer from generating mature miR-181b. The subsequent decrease
  in levels of mature miR-181b blocks its ability to silence translation of its mRNA
  targets. Although the identity of these mRNA targets remains to be identified, we
  hypothesize that allowing them to be translated by reducing miR-181b levels leads
  to increased extracellular levels of TGF-β. According to this model, excess TGF-β
  signaling drives the increase in VSMC and ECM stiffness underlying LAS.
