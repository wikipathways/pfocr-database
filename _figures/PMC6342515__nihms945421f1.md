caption: 'There are two major pathways contributing to NAD synthesis: de novo synthesis
  and salvage from precursors. The de novo pathway of NAD synthesis converts tryptophan
  to quinolinic acid (QA) via the kynurenine pathway. The salvage pathways recycle
  nicotinamide mononuclotide (NMN), nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide (NAM)
  and nicotinic acid (NA) in various cellular compartments including the nucleus and
  mitochondria. These precursors are present in the extracellular milieu and may be
  transported across the plasma membrane where they are utilized. Extracellular NAD
  is cleaved by nucleotide phosphatases (CD73) or glycohydrolases (CD38 and CD157).
  Cleavage by CD73 yields NMN which CD73 can then re-cleave to yield NR. Cleavage
  by CD38 or CD157 yields NAM. NAM is also produced within cells by NAD+-consuming
  enzymes such as sirtuins, PARPS and SARM1. NAM and NR are converted to NMN by NAMPT
  and NRKs respectively. NMN and NAMN then are converted to NAD and NAAD respectively
  and NAAD is amidated by NADS to yield NAD. Cellular NAD levels may be boosted by
  activators of the salvage pathway (green) or by inhibitors of enzymes that consume
  NAD+ such as CD38, PARPs, and SARM1 (red).'
