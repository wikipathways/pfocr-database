caption: 'Dysregulation of tryptophan metabolism in aged CRs. Tryptophan obtained
  from food is absorbed in the small intestine. Up-regulation of key gene TPH1, which
  is involved in 5-HT synthesis, and up-regulation of IFN-γ, which is involved in
  the conversion of tryptophan into kynurenine, suggest a decrease in circulating
  tryptophan in aged CRs. On the other hand, in the colon, tryptophan is metabolized
  by gut microbiota to produce indole-3-carboxaldehyde, 3-indolepropionic acid, and
  indoleacrylic acid. Our results showed that Lactobacillus abundance decreased in
  old CRs, leading to a decrease in AhR ligands in the plasma. Down-regulation of
  the Toll-like receptor TLR1:TLR2 and Toll-like receptor 3 signaling pathways and
  up-regulation of vitamin D biosynthetic process pathway suggested that activity
  of DCs decreased, which may lead to a decrease in IL-27 expression and an increase
  in IL-21 expression. The decrease in microbial tryptophan metabolites may affect
  intestinal mucosal barrier integrity, allowing gut pathogens (such as Salmonella
  and Sarcina) to invade the host. Thus, these changes can induce the occurrence of
  inflammation and various gut diseases. Increased FFAs can lead to inflammation and
  accumulation of CARs, which may induce various metabolic diseases in aged CRs. CRs:
  Chinese rhesus macaques; AhR: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; DCs: Dendritic cells; FFA:
  Free fatty acids; CAR: Acyl carnitine.'
