caption: 'A systems-based logic model depicting types of services and associated pathways
  to TB case detection. The model distinguishes six pathways to TB case detection,
  namely two care-seeking pathways (green and black dashed lines) and four screening
  pathways (green, blue, orange and grey solid lines). People perceiving themselves
  to have a health problem and access general health services follow the general care-seeking
  pathway, where a provider can identify presumptive TB on routine assessment, i.e.
  history-taking and clinical examination, of an individual patient (green dashed
  line). People perceiving themselves to have TB symptoms may also follow the specific
  TB care-seeking pathway to TB diagnostic services, where all people accessing care
  are evaluated for possible active TB (black dashed line). People invited to TB services
  regardless of symptoms follow TB screening pathways and may be identified with presumptive
  TB even if they do not seek care for TB symptoms. Four screening pathways are distinguished:
  TB screening offered to all people accessing general health services (green solid
  line), dedicated TB screening services with open invitation to a whole population
  or TB contacts (blue solid line), TB screening offered to target group members at
  home, work or school (orange solid line) and TB screening offered to people living
  with HIV linked to care (grey solid line). A person who screens positive on the
  TB screening pathway is identified as a presumptive TB case and should receive confirmation
  of a diagnosis by accessing TB diagnostic services'
