caption: A simplified model of systemic nitrate signaling in root foraging responses.
  Local N deprivation can trigger the production of CLE peptides and CEP peptides.
  CLE peptides are recognized by the nearby CLV1 receptor resulting in restriction
  of lateral root growth. Meanwhile, CEP peptides are translocated from roots to shoots,
  and perceived by a kind of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) named
  as CEP receptors (CEPR), and then leading to generation of a secondary signal polypeptides
  named as CEPD (CEP downstream) in shoots, that further move back to the roots and
  promote nitrate uptake and root growth. As the homologue of CEPD, CEPDL (CEPD like)
  also can translocate from shoots to roots, contributing to regulate root nitrate
  acquisition cooperatively. In addition, HY5 is a light stabilized transcription
  factor, which can induce the expression of TPS1 gene in shoots. As a systemic signal,
  shoot-to-root mobile HY5 protein will induce the expression of NRT2.1 gene in roots
  to stimulate the ability of nitrate absorption. Although there is no clue about
  the systemic signal, TCP20 has been demonstrated to play key roles in nitrate systemic
  signaling pathway by split-root assays
