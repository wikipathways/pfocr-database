caption: The mechanism of circRNA in cardiovascular disease. (a) The cZNF609 can act
  as a sponge for miR-150-5p, leading to enhanced expression of AKT3. (b) Mechanism
  of action of circRNA in atherosclerosis (the highly conserved circLrp6 has multiple
  binding sites for miR-145, which interacts with multiple targets, such as ITGb8,
  fasin, KLF4, Yes1, and lox; silencing CHFR through the miR-370/FOXO1 axis inhibits
  the proliferation and migration ability of VSMCs). (c) The overexpression of CDR1as
  in vivo promoted the increase of the MI area and enhanced the expression of the
  miR-7 target genes PARP and SP1; circRNA ACR can reduce myocardial I/R injury by
  regulating the autophagy of the Pink1/FAM65B pathway; MFCAR can adsorb miR-652-3p
  to prevent it from binding to MTP18, thereby increasing MTP18 expression. (d) Expression
  level of circfoxo3 in tissues of the elderly and its relationship with aging β-galactosidase
  activity (SA-β-Gal) increased significantly; knockout of circtn105-11 will increase
  the sensitivity of cells to Dox. (e) CDRlas acts as a sponge of miR-135a and miR-135b
  to target and regulate hmoxl; HRCR can act as a molecular sponge to “adsorb” miR-223,
  increase the expression of antiapoptotic protein ARC downstream of miR-223, and
  inhibit pathological cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac function exhaustion. (f) circHIPK3
  sponges miR-29b-3p and upregulates α-SMA, COL1A1, and COL3A1; circRNA_010567 can
  mediate the expression of collagen type I, collagen type II, and α-SMA through the
  mir-141/TGF-β1 pathway, thereby promoting cardiac muscle fibrosis. (g) circRNA Sirt1
  can bind to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and miR-132/212 in the cytoplasm and
  the nucleus to inhibit the activation of NF-κB; circ-RELL1 can act on NF-κB through
  the positive feedback of the miR-6873-3p/MyD88 axis; inhibiting the expression of
  Hsa_circ_0068087 can block the inflammatory response signaling pathway of TLR4/NF-κB/NOD/NLRP3.
