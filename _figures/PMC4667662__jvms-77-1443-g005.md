caption: Possible hypothesis; two signaling pathways of LPS to induce motility disorder
  in intestinal smooth muscles. LPS stimulates TLR4 receptor to induce COX-2. Released
  PGE2 stimulates EP2/ EP4 on smooth muscle cells via AC/cAMP signaling to lead motility
  disorder (Early phase pathway). In addition, prolonged release of PGE2 stimulates
  EP2/EP4 receptors on intestinal macrophages to induce iNOS via AC/cAMP/ERK signal.
  Inducible NOS produces NO, resulting in the inhibition of intestinal motility via
  GC/cGMP signaling (Late phase pathway) [, ]. In small intestinal muscle layer, direct
  induction of iNOS gene via activation of TLR4 may be minor pathway. TLR4; Toll-like
  receptor 4. To confirm this hypothesis, it will be required to measure time-dependent
  changes in NO and PGE2 when LPS is applied to rat ileum.
