caption: Anti-TNFR2 bs-Ab mechanism of action. A. DCs activate both CD8+ T cells and
  NK cells by TAA-MHC-1 presentation and secretion of IL-12 and IFN-γ. B, C, and D.
  Following the activation, CD8+ T cells and NK cells will attack and destroy BC cells
  by producing high quantities of IL-12, IFN-γ, and gra-B. BC cells and BCSCs, in
  turn, express EGFR, Mb-TNF-α, TNFR2, PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4, and also produce IL-6,
  IL-10, PEG2, VEGF, TGF-β, and ARG-1, which suppress DCs, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells.
  Other immunosuppressive cells, including MDSCs, T-regs, B-regs, CAFs, EPCs, and
  MSCs in the BC TME also produce tremendous quantities of IL-6, IL-10, PEG2, VEGF,
  ARG-1, and TGF-β, as well as over-express TNFR2, PD-1, PD-L1, EGFR, Mb-TNF-α, and
  CTLA-4, leading to DC, CD8+ T cell, and NK cell suppression. E. T cell engager bs-Ab
  (TNFR2 × CD3ε) targeting CD3ε on CD8+ T cells and TNFR2 on BC cells and BCSCs, blocking
  the signals of TNFR2 and stimulating CD8+ T cells to kill tumors. F. NK cells engager
  bs-Ab (TNFR2 × NK cell activating receptors) targeting NK cell activating receptors
  (NCR1, NCR2/NKp44, NCR3/NKp30, NCR3/NKp46, NKG2D, and MICA/B) on NK cells and TNFR2
  on BC cells and BCSCs blocking the signals of TNFR2 and stimulating NK cells to
  kill tumor. G, I, and L. bs-Ab targeting TNFR2 on TNFR2+ cells to hinder its signal
  as well as targeting CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, Mb-TNF-α, ARG-1, PGE2 TGFβR2, VEGFR1,2,
  IL-6R, and IL-10R expressed by the same cells inhibit their signaling pathway. These
  bs-Ab capture TGF-β, VEGF, IL-6, IL-10, ARG-1, and PGE2, which in turn diminishes
  the immunosuppressive effect in BC TME. K. bs-Ab (TNFR2 × EGFR) targeting TNFR2
  and EGFR on BC cells, BCSCs, and the immunosuppressive cells to suppress their signals
  and induce an effective anti-tumor immune response. L. Bs-Ab (TNFR2 × TNFR2) binding
  to one chain of the tri-TNFR2 complex to prevent clustering on the surface of BC
  cells, BCSCs, MDSCs, T-regs, B-regs, CAFs, EPCs, and MSCs. TNFR2, tumor necrosis
