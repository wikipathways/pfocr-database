caption: Genes associated with milk fat metabolism are shown to be positively (arrowheads)
  or negatively (end lines) regulated by miR-103 over-expressed. Genes in one box
  indicated that they were involved in one process of milk fat synthesis. Over-expression
  of miR-103 can increase fat droplet, triglyceride, and fatty acid contents, which
  had been identified in the manuscript. MiR-103 was co-regulated with PANK and miR-103
  also can regulate PANK expression though an unknown pathway.
