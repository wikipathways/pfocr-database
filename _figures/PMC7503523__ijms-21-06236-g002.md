caption: 'Polyomavirus JC: one virus, two stories. (A) In cells permissive to JCV
  infection, such as oligodendrocytes, viral transcription proceeds the viral DNA
  replication since the product of the viral early genes LTAg and stAg is essential
  for initiation and progression of the lytic cycle in oligodendrocytes and progression
  of PML. JCV LTAg is a multifunctional protein with many domains and it is important
  for viral DNA replication and for the transcriptional switch from early to late
  genes which culminates in the production of capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 and
  final virions assembly. In cells non permissive to the viral infection, LTAg protein
  starts modulating many cellular functions through its many domains by interacting
  with cellular regulators, such as pRb, p53, Wnt, and IGF-1R signaling pathways and
  DNA damage response factors, promoting cell cycle progression, apoptosis inhibition
  and DNA damage which culminate in tumor onset. (B) In detail, the inactivation of
  pRb by LTAg promotes cell cycle progression through the release of E2F and activation
  of p14ARF expression which leads to the stabilization of p53. However, LTAg binds
  and inactivates p53 preventing the p53 action in response to the DNA damage or p14ARF
  production. In mice transgenic for the JCV early region, LTAg may also inhibit the
  tumor suppressor activity of p53 through the interaction with neurofibromatosis
  type 2 (NF-2), a protein that neutralizes the inhibitory effect of Mdm2 on p53,
  with the development of tumors. LTAg is also known to interact with components of
  different signaling pathways which are associated with cellular transformation such
  as β-catenin, insulin receptor substrate -1 (IRS-1), and survivin. β-catenin is
  a crucial protein of the Wnt signaling pathway normally located and degraded in
  the cytoplasm. LTAg can bind the C-terminus of this protein, resulting in its nuclear
  translocation and subsequent activation of c-Myc and cyclin D1 TCF promoter, leading
  to cellular proliferation. LTAg can also stabilize β-catenin through a non-canonical
  Wnt signal pathway, recruiting the GTPase protein Rac1 that stabilizes β-catenin
  by inhibiting its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. IRS-1 is the downstream
  docking molecule of the insulin growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway. As for
  β-catenin, LTAg binds and stabilizes g IRS-1 in the cytoplasm with the result of
  its nuclear translocation. The unusual presence of IRS-1 in the nucleus enhances
  its binding and inactivation of enzyme Rad51 which is involved in repairing of DNA
  double-stranded breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR). The inactivation
  of Rad51 prevents the HR forcing the cell to repair its DSBs via non-homologous
  end-joining (NHEJ). LTAg cooperates also with IGF-1R increasing the level of survivin,
  which protects infected cells from apoptosis by dysregulation of cellular homeostasis
  and oncogenesis. Infection of glial cells by JCV inflicts also severe cellular DNA
  damage throughout LTAg which inactivates the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)
  and ATM- and Rad3-Related (ATR) kinases. Small t antigen (stAg) is another significant
  viral protein that has roles in viral production and influencing host cell growth.
  Its interactions with retinoblastoma proteins (pRbs) and protein phosphatase 2A
  (PP2A) result in alterations of DNA damage response, inhibition of the Wnt signaling
  pathway, and alteration in cytoskeletal proteins. Finally, Agno protein also affects
  the DDR: Agno protein can bind to the Ku70 DNA repair protein, sequestering it in
  the perinuclear space and impairing the NHEJ. In addition, the cooperation between
  Agno protein and p53 seems to induce the activation of p21/WAF-1 gene expression.'
