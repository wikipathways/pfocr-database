caption: Schematic of nicotinamide riboside/NAD/SIRT1 pathway in sepsis. Sepsis induces
  ROS production and inhibits NAD+/SIRT1 signaling, leading to HMGB1 release, apoptosis
  and inflammation, which contribute to organ injury. Nicotinamide riboside is converted
  to NAD+ and subsequently activates SIRT1 signaling. Activation of SIRT1 inhibits
  ROS production and HMGB1 release thereby attenuating apoptosis and inflammation,
  and finally protecting against organ injury in sepsis. EX527 inhibits SIRT1 activation
  and reverses the protective effects of nicotinamide riboside on septic organ injury.
