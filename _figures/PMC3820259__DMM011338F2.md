caption: The roles of lipids in the tumour microenvironment. Lipids play important
  roles during tumour initiation and disease progression. Activation of HMGCR drives
  cell transformation (stage 1). Activation of SREBP and induction of enzymes of the
  mevalonate pathway are involved in the disruption of normal tissue architecture,
  and release of FAs by MAGL can promote cancer cell migration (stage 2). Lipids are
  also involved in the interaction of cancer cells with components of the tumour stroma.
  For example, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) show increased expression of FASN.
  Signalling lipids, including PGE2, regulate the recruitment of cancer-promoting
  M2 macrophages, which can promote cancer cell migration and invasion (stage 3).
  LPA and S1P regulate the cytotoxic function of natural killer (NK) cells. PGE2 can
  also act as a pro-angiogenic factor by promoting the outgrowth (sprouting) of vascular
  and lymphatic endothelial cells, and the dissemination of tumour cells into distant
  tissues during metastasis formation (stage 4). Adipocytes can induce the homing
  of metastatic cancer cells by releasing cytokines (stage 5). The metabolic coupling
  between adipocytes and cancer cells involves the release of FAs by adipocytes, which
  are then used for energy production by cancer cells (stage 6).
