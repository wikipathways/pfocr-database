caption: Plastid proteins are arranged by major metabolic pathway or biological process,
  with each protein shown as rosettes. Each rosette (described in the legend) relates
  to the homologs of a specific nucleus-encoded and plastid-targeted protein, with
  each circle within each rosette corresponding to a different species, and different
  colors corresponding to different evolutionary affiliations. Proteins of plastid-late
  (haptophyte) origin, such as are concentrated in photosystem and ribosomal processes,
  are colored red; and proteins of plastid-early (dinoflagellate) origin, such as
  are concentrated in carbon and amino acid metabolism are colored blue. Additional
  phylogenetic origins are denoted by further examples in the legend, e.g., LGT shown
  in orange, green, and brown. Proteins encoded in plastid genomes (red with black
  border) are provided for the incomplete genome assembly for Karlodinium micrum,
  and partial plastid transcriptomes are identified for Karenia mikimotoi and Karenia
  brevis. In certain cases (shown as rosettes with multiple colors), homologs from
  different species have different evolutionary origins, e.g., Karenia possessing
  plastid-late and Karlodinium/Takayama plastid-early. A detailed breakdown of the
  individual sequences with their predicted origins used for this reconstruction are
  available in Dataset , and an alternative graphic, including the RSD, is available
  as Appendix Fig. .
