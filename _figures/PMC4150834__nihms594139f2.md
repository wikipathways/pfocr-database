caption: Transcription of the MC1R gene leads preferentially to the MC1R-001 transcript
  (1). Translation occurs in the rough ER, where post-translational modifications
  including oligomerization and glycosylation are also performed (2). Glycosylated
  oligomers proceed to the Golgi, then to the plasma membrane, and forward trafficking
  is dependent on Thr157 phosphorylation (3). For simplicity, the receptor is depicted
  as a monomer on the cell surface, but its structure is likely dimeric/oligomeric.
  Upon agonist binding, MC1R activates AC via the Gs protein, thus triggering cAMP
  synthesis and PKA activation (4). Active PKA catalytic subunits move to the nucleus
  to activate CREB transcription factors, which in turn increase the rate of transcription
  of the MITF gene (5). Agonist-activated MC1R also transactivates cKIT or a related
  RTK to trigger the NRAS-BRAF-MEK-ERK cascade (6). Active ERKs can phosphorylate
  MITF to increase its transcriptional activity and its proteasome-dependent degradation
  (7). Active MITF promotes transcription of the genes encoding for melanogenic enzymes
  (8), and for MC1R. Agonist-bound MC1R can also be desensitized by GRK2 or GRK6-dependent
  phosphorylation and ARRB2 recruitment (9), followed by sequestration in endocytic
  vesicles (10) whose likely destination is recycling to the cell surface (11).
