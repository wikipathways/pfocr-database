caption: G-protein-based two-hybrid systems. (A) Sos recruitment system (). A chimeric
  protein of bait X with hSos is recruited to the plasma membrane upon interaction
  of X with a membrane protein (Y). Subsequent GDP-GTP exchange of Ras by membrane-localized
  hSos enables cell growth by virtue of Ras activity in a temperature-sensitive cdc25-2
  background strain. (B) Ras recruitment system (). Similar to the case in the Sos
  recruitment system, a membrane-bound prey protein Y that interacts with bait X,
  fused to mammalian Ras (mRas), will bring mRas to the membrane, where it can activate
  its downstream target adenylate cyclase to establish cell growth at a restrictive
  temperature (36°C) in a cdc25-2 background strain. (C) G protein fusion system ().
  Association of the γ (Ste18) and β pheromone G protein subunits is required for
  a response to the addition of pheromones. Strong interaction of a membrane bait
  protein (X) with the prey protein Y, in fusion with Ste18 (Gγ), pulls Gγ away from
  Gβ. This dissociation hinders the pheromone response in a ste18 strain, which can
  be detected by growth in the presence of α pheromone (halo assay) or by the lack
  of gene expression of reporters under the control of pheromone-responsive elements
  (PREs). (D) Gγ recruitment system (). Interaction between a membrane-bound prey
  protein (Y) and a bait protein (X), fused to Gγ lacking a membrane attachment sequence,
  unites the G protein β and γ subunits to induce the pheromone pathway after addition
  of α pheromone. Readouts are reporter genes regulated by PREs or the observation
  of growth in a mating assay with a ste18 strain.
