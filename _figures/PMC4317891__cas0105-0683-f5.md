caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying the effect of efatutazone in erlotinib-resistant
  non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells. (a) The enhanced motility of PC-9ER and
  PC-9ZD cells was induced by activation of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)
  pathway due to increased TGF-β2 mRNA expression and subsequent secretion. (b) Enhanced
  motility of PC-9ER and PC-9ZD cells was suppressed by treatment with efatutazone.
  Efatutazone treatment significantly antagonized TGF-β2-mediated activation of the
  TGF-β pathway by suppressing TGF-β2 mRNA expression. The effect of efatutazone on
  TGF-β2 expression may not be due to direct activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling. The mechanism underlying efatutazone-mediated
  TGF-β2 downregulation requires further study.
