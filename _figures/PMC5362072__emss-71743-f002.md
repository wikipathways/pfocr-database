caption: STING-driven cytokine secretion can activate adaptive immunity and prevent
  tumor growthA) Tumor derived-DNA recognition by STING, leads to IFNα/β secretion
  by CD8α+ DC, increased cross-priming and T cell activation()B) DNA damage induced
  by carcinogens, such as azoxymethane (AOM) or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), triggers
  activation of the STING signaling pathway, resulting in IL-18 and IL-1β cytokine
  expression and favoring wound repair and tumor growth control().
