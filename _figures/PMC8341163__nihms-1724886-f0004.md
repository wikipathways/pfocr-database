caption: A typical CBE intermediate features a U•G mismatch accompanied by a 5’ Cas-induced
  nick. A) The CBE intermediate can be repaired back to C•G by first re-ligation of
  the nick through SSBR, followed by the deoxyuridine being processed by BER. B) The
  CBE intermediate can lead to C•G to T•A outcomes when DNA synthesis occurs across
  the deoxyuridine, which can be achieved by either the LP-SSBR, ncMMR, or normal
  DNA replication. The resulting U•A base pair can be resolved into a T•A base pair
  by BER. C) The CBE intermediate can also result in C•G to non-T•A outcomes, which
  is mediated by DNA synthesis across abasic sites. Abasic sites are generated by
  excision of uracil by UNG2. DNA synthesis to replace the nicked strand is then carried
  out by LP-SSBR or ncMMR. Depending on the pathway involved, either an RPA-coated
  ssDNA gap or a 5’-flap would form, which are depicted by dashed lines. Replicative
  polymerases Pol δ and Pol ε stall at abasic sites, leading to a subsequent TLS activation
  to rescue the stalled DNA synthesis and bypass the lesion. There are three potential
  downstream routes. (1) REV1 is recruited to PCNA. It can insert a dCMP opposite
  abasic sites. (2) Alternatively, REV1 can recruit other error-prone polymerases,
  such as Pol η, Pol ι and Pol κ, to the stalled site. They are capable of incorporating
  both dCMP and dTMP opposite abasic sites. (3) The REV1-independent pathway depends
  on the recruitment of error-prone polymerases by monoubiquitylation of PCNA. Ligation
  of the newly synthesized strand by LIG1 forms an intact abasic site-containing intermediate,
  which is further processed by APE1 and the rest of the BER machinery. This eventually
  leads to the formation of C•G to G•C and C•G to A•T outcomes. D) The CBE intermediate
  can be processed into indels, which we attribute to in situ DSB formation. (1) DSBs
  can arise from processing of deoxyuridine by UNG2 and APE1 before the re-ligation
  of the Cas-induced nick. (2) DSBs can also be originated from helicase unwinding
  of the nicked strand during DNA replication. DSB processing by both NHEJ and MMEJ
  can lead to indels.
