caption: The regulation pathway of System Xc−/GSH/GPx4 in ferroptosis. ① System Xc−
  transport cystine into the cell and reverse Glu out of the cell in a 1:1 ratio.
  ② Cystine absorbed by System Xc− is reduced to cysteine by G-SH or TrxR1. ③ Then
  GCL links cysteine and glutamate to produce γ-GC. ④ γ-GC and Gly are catalyzed by
  GSS to produce G-SH. ⑤In the catalytic cycle of GPx4, the GPx4-SeH is oxidized by
  the P-LOOH to GPx4-SeOH, while G-SH can reduce -SeOH and further activates GPx4,
  releasing GS-SG to prevent GPx4 from being inactivated. ⑥GS-SG is reduced to G-SH
  under the action of GR and Coenzyme NADPH. Since P-LOOH is reduced to PLOH by GPx4-SeH,
  ferroptosis is inhibited. ⑦Fe2+ can produce a large number of PLOOH through the
  Fenton reaction.
