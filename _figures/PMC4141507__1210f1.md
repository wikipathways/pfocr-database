caption: HLH-associated genes and digenic inheritance. A simplified pathway of formation,
  polarization, and transport of cytotoxic granules that is essential for lymphocyte
  cytotoxicity is shown. Biallelic mutations have been reported for all of these genes
  in patients with fHLH. Zhang et al describe digenic heterozygous mutations in the
  highlighted genes. Digenic mutations in degranulation pathway genes (blue/blue)
  in this series had earlier onset of disease than digenic mutations in a degranulation
  pathway gene and PRF1 (blue/red).
