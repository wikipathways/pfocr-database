caption: 'Model of cross-talk between D2R and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, and Wnt3a transcriptional
  regulation. We propose the following mechanism by which D2R and Wnt3a reciprocally
  regulate their expression: (a) Wnt3a stimulation of the Frizzled (FZD) receptor/LRP5/6
  complex leads to less β-catenin degradation via the destruction complex and proteasomal
  pathway. Instead, more β-catenin is available for translocation into the nucleus
  where it increases Wnt3a transcription and expression via a TCF/LEF site within
  the Wnt3a promoter. This leads to a positive feedback loop that amplifies further
  Wnt3a signaling. (b) Increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin also upregulates
  D2R expression through TCF/LEF sites within the D2R promoter. Increased D2R expression
  leads to more β-catenin phosphorylation, resulting in enhanced β-catenin proteasomal
  degradation and therefore less β-catenin nuclear translocation. This ultimately
  inhibits further β-catenin-mediated Wnt3a transcription to maintain cellular homeostasis.'
