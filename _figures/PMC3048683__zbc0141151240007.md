caption: 'Hypothesized model of lipofuscin prevention by C20-D3-vitamin A. Pathways
  for retinaldehyde/phosphatidylethanolamine Schiff base (Retinaldehyde-PE) clearance
  from the disk lumen. The shaded area represents the disk lumen. Clearance pathways
  are marked 1–5. Arrows going outside the gray area represent movement out of the
  disk lumen. In theory, the retinaldehyde-PE Schiff base that forms in the rod outer
  segment after photon isomerization may follow several pathways: 1) it can react
  to form A2E leading to lipofuscin; 2) it may be actively (ABCA4 mediated) or passively
  (diffusion) transported out of the disk lumen; 3) it may dissociate back to retinaldehyde
  and PE and retinaldehyde may then be actively or passively transported out of the
  disk lumen (); 4) it may isomerize, dissociate and the generated 11-cis-retinaldehyde
  may recombine with opsin to form rhodopsin () or 11-cis-retinaldehyde and its other
  isomers may be actively or passively transported out of the disk lumen; and lastly
  5) it may be delivered to the RPE directly when the outer segment is phagocytosed.
  In pathways 2–5 retinaldehyde can presumably be reincorporated back into the visual
  cycle. Once outside the disk lumen retinaldehyde can be reduced to retinol. In the
  case of ABCA4 defects leading to Stargardt disease pathway two is slowed resulting
  in, presumably, an increase in pathway one leading initially to vitamin A dimerization,
  lipofuscin formation and ultimately vision loss. By the incorporation of deuterium
  atoms at the C20 position of vitamin A, we have shown in prior work that pathway
  one becomes higher in energy, and as a result is slowed down. This should allow
  more time for retinaldehyde to be re-incorporated into the visual cycle via pathways
  2–5. Through this mechanism, the use of C20-deuterated vitamin A may be an effective
  methodology toward mitigating the clinical consequences of alterations in the ABCA4
  gene.'
