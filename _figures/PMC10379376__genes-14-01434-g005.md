caption: Main targets of miR-290/294 cluster. The miR-290/295 cluster modulates both
  stemness and differentiation characteristics of mouse ESCs and embryos by regulating
  cell cycle, de novo DNA methylation, apoptosis, and transcription of pluripotent-associated
  transcription factors. The cytoplasmic mature miR-290/295 members maintain pluripotency
  of mESC by accelerating G1 and extending S phase through direct targeting of cell
  cycle inhibitors such as p21, Lats2, Wee1, and Fbxl5, and also repressing S/G2 transition.
  These mature miRNAs also incorporate Prc2, Ezh2 and Suz12 into promoters of bivalent
  differentiation genes. The miR-290/295 cluster together with miR-302/376 promote
  transition from naïve to primed pluripotency by enhancing the activity of MEK pathway
  through direct repression of Akt1. These mature miRNAs partially favor pluripotency
  upon differentiation by direct targeting of Dkk-1, a Wnt pathway inhibitor, resulting
  in upregulation of c-Myc. The mature miR-290/295 gene products also modulate DNA
  methylation in the pre-implantation embryos by targeting of Rbl2 and subsequent
  inhibition of Dnmt3b. The miR-290/295 cluster also enhances the reprogramming of
  somatic cells and the quality of mouse iPSCs through post-transcriptional suppression
  of Ash1l expression and consequently downregulation of HOX genes, which in turn
  promote reprogramming through polycomb-mediated gene silencing.
