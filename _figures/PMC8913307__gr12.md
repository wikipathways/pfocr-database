caption: The possible exposure pathway of antibiotics through a hypothetically illustrated
  aquaculture setup. Different sources like raw materials of the feed, some intentional
  approaches of the farmers, and various waste disposals input the antibiotics into
  the setup, which afterward affect the local environment and public health through
  contaminated water sources and sediments, including consumption and handling of
  the aquaculture end products and in consequences, antimicrobial resistance becomes
  developed into different ecological compartments (; ; ; ; ; ; ).
