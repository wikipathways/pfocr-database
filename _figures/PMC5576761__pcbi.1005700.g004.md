caption: 'Nodes are genes, and edges are either protein-protein interactions or known
  pathway interactions. Left: all genes in the component, including up-, down-regulated,
  and mixed genes. Right: the up-regulated genes only. This subnetwork suggests high
  activity of immune response (which was identified in the original study). Two central
  genes in the immune response are INFG and JAK2. Our analysis detected both, whereas
  the original study detected only IFNG. Moreover, the connectivity of the network
  is established by our newly detected genes.'
