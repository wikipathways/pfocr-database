caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling pathway. TLR4 signaling pathway can
  be regulated by MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. Upon the activation
  of MyD88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and tumor necrosis factor-receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6) are recruited to lead to degradation of IKKβ and disinhibition
  of NF-κB, which results in pro-inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., TNF-α and
  IL-6). The MyD88 pathway signals also activate MAKP and extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) through TRAF6, which results in AP-1 activation. The MyD88-independent
  pathway is TRIF dependent. Upon the activation of TRIF-related adaptor molecule
  (TRAM)/TRIF, TRAFs are recruited, which leads to interferon regulatory factor 3
  (IRF3) activation and type I IFN production.
