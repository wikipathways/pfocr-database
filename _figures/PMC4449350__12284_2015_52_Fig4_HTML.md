caption: A hypothetical model for the SPL5 signaling pathway in rice. The SPL5 may
  act as a negative regulatory factor activating the serotonin metabolic pathway,
  which is mediated by OsWRKY14. The accumulation of serotonin may lead to pathogen
  resistance in rice.
papertitle: Transcriptome profiling of the spl5 mutant reveals that SPL5 has a negative
  role in the biosynthesis of serotonin for rice disease resistance.
