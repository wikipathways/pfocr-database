caption: Anatomical features of the taste-aversion or preference pathways. The Sensory
  pathway for taste is at the left of the figure, with cranial nerves for taste (CrN
  VII, IX, and X) coming in to the brainstem at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarius
  (NTS). The NTS projects to the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and then to the taste
  relay in the thalamus (VPMpc) and finally to the insular cortex (IC). The area postrema
  (AP) is a circumventricular organ (CVO) allowing molecules in the blood to enter
  the brainstem at the level of the NTS. Other elements of the figure, for Integration
  with the learned aspects of the responses, are the same as in
papertitle: The Brainâ€™s Response to an Essential Amino Acid-Deficient Diet and the
  Circuitous Route to a Better Meal.
