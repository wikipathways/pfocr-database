caption: Role of MKP-2 in AEC survival. Earlier work demonstrated blockade of ANG
  II/angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced p-JNK and apoptosis by the ANG-(1–7)/mas
  pathway (). ACE-2 limits the accumulation of ANG II by degrading the octapeptide
  ANG II to the heptapeptide ANG-(1–7). In the current study, the data support that
  ANG-(1–7) upregulates MKP-2 through mas receptor, sustaining low p-JNK levels to
  promote AEC survival. Blockade or knock down of mas by the receptor antagonist A779
  or antisense oligonucleotides prevented the induction of MKP-2 by ANG-(1–7). The
  intermediate signaling mechanism(s) by which ANG-(1–7)/mas activates MKP-2 are currently
  unknown (??).
