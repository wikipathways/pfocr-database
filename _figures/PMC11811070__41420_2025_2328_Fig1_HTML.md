caption: The extrinsic pathway (left side) is initiated by the binding of death ligands,
  such as FasL or TNF-α, to their respective death receptors on the cell surface,
  leading to the recruitment of adaptor proteins and the activation of initiator caspase-8.
  Caspase-8 then activates downstream effector caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-7,
  resulting in cell death. The intrinsic pathway (right side) is triggered by intracellular
  stress signals, such as DNA damage or oxidative stress, which cause mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization through BAX and BAK activation. This releases cytochrome
  c into the cytosol, forming the apoptosome complex and activating initiator caspase-9.
  Both pathways converge on the activation of effector caspases, culminating in apoptotic
  cell death
