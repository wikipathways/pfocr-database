caption: 'NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy pathway is regulated by intracellular iron.
  (a) Schematic of NCOA4 transcript variants in humans: NCOA4α and NCOA4β. NCOA4α
  is a 614 Aa protein (70 kDa) with an N-terminal coiled coil domain and a C-terminal
  domain that contains a FTH1 and HERC2 binding domain (Aa 383–509). NCOA4β (286 Aa,
  35 kDa) shares with NCOA4α the N-terminal domain and a portion of the C-terminal
  domain. (b) Poly rC—binding protein 1 (PCBP1) binds to iron (Fe) and delivers it
  to ferritin. Fe is stored in ferritin complexes containing ferritin heavy and light
  chains. NCOA4 binds to ferritin through its C-terminal domain and delivers it to
  the nascent autophagosome. The mechanisms involved in NCOA4 delivery to the autophagosome
  are unclear but could involve non-canonical LIR motifs. Fusion of the autophagosome
  with the lysosome leads to degradation of ferritin and iron release in a process
  known as “ferritinophagy.” Some studies also suggest alternative pathways for lysosomal
  delivery of NCOA4-ferritin complexes involving the endosomal pathway (endosomal
  sorting complex required for transport: ESCRT). Iron is exported to the cytosol
  where it can be used in several physiological processes that involve iron such as
  mitochondrial heme synthesis and erythroid differentiation. Increased ferritinophagy
  flux correlates with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and a type of cell
  death known as ferroptosis. Increased ferritinophagy flux has also been observed
  in certain E. coli urinary tract infections []. Finally, iron is also likely required
  for other physiological processes like liver iron homeostasis and central nervous
  system (CNS) development, although further research is required to clarify NCOA4’s
  role in the CNS disease under normal and pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration.
  (c) NCOA4 levels and ferritinophagy are regulated by intracellular iron levels.
  In iron-replete conditions, HERC2 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) binds NCOA4 in an iron-dependent
  manner and mediates its proteasomal degradation. NCOA4 can also be degraded by basal
  autophagy. Decreased NCOA4 levels lead to stabilization of ferritin by decreased
  ferritinophagy flux and decreased intracellular levels of iron.'
