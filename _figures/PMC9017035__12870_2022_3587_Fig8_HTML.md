caption: Proposed model of the HSF-HSP pathway and ROS pathway involving in response
  to heat stress in lily. Heat stress induced the expression of numerous DEGs including
  the genes of HSF-HSP pathway and ROS pathway which responded quickly and strongly
  to the heat stress in the transcriptome expression profile. Moreover, these two
  pathways shared some common DEGs belonging to sHSPs family during heat stress response
  indicating that sHSPs family play an important role in regulation mechanisms of
  heat stress response in lily
