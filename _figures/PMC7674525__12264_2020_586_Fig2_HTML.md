caption: Schematic of the proposed mechanism controlling the inner hair cell membrane
  potential. ATP, spontaneously released through connexin Cx 26 and Cx 30 hemichannels
  (1), binds to the auto- and heteroreceptors P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 (2) on inner supporting
  cells (ISCs). G-protein coupled P2YRs activate the PLC-IP3signaling pathway that
  elevates the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Connexin gap junctions (3) allow
  diffusion of IP3 and Ca2+ to neighboring ISCs, thus building an intercellular Ca2+
  wave that reaches the vicinity of IHCs. Elevated [Ca2+]i activates the TMEM16A channel
  (4), leading to Cl– efflux that is balanced by K+ efflux through the leak K+ channels
  (5). The rise in extracellular K+ concentration depolarizes the IHC, resulting in
  a series of Ca2+-dependent APs shaped mainly by the KV delayed rectifier K+ channel
  (6) and the CaV1.3 Ca2+ channel (7). Further sculpting of the IHC firing pattern
  is achieved via SK2 K+ channel (8) that is activated by the Ca2+ influx through
  the surrounding α9α10 nicotinic ACh receptors (9) and P2X3 receptors (10). Additional
  Ca2+ entry and IHC depolarization might be achieved through P2X2 receptors (11)
  located in the proximity of stereocilia. AF, spiral ganglion neuron afferent fiber;
  EF, medial olivocochlear efferent fiber.
