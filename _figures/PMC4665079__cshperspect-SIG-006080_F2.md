caption: The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In response to various cellular stresses,
  proapoptotic members of the Bcl2 family induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
  (MOMP), allowing the release into the cytosol of proapoptotic factors that are normally
  sequestered in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria (including cytochrome
  c, Smac, and Omi). In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to APAF1 and triggers its
  oligomerization. Caspase-9 is then recruited and activated by this platform, known
  as the apoptosome. Catalytically active caspase-9 cleaves and activates the executioner
  caspases-3 and -7. Upon release in the cytosol, Smac and Omi bind to and inhibit
  the caspase inhibitor X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). In doing so, they
  relieve XIAP inhibition of caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-7, and potentiate overall
  caspase activation by the apoptosome.
