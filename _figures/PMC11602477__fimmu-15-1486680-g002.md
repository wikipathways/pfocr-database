caption: Notch signaling pathway in CSCs (By Figdraw). Notch receptors (Notch 1-4
  in mammals) interact with ligands (such as Delta-like ligands and Jagged/Serrate
  ligands) on neighboring cells. This interaction triggers a series of proteolytic
  cleavage events that release the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD). NICD then
  translocates into the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional activation complex
  with other proteins, including the CSL (CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1) transcription
  factor. This complex regulates the expression of target genes involved in various
  cellular processes. Dysregulation of the Notch signaling pathway has been implicated
  in numerous diseases, including cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cardiovascular
  diseases
