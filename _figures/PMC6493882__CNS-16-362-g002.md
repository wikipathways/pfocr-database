caption: 'Two potential grounds for attenuation of IFN‐β bioactivity by statins. (A)
  Blocking of IFN‐β induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and (B) differential impact on
  cytokine secretion and subsequent T‐cell differentiation. (A) Simplified scheme
  of the IFN‐α/β signaling pathway: binding of IFN‐α/β with the receptor complex IFNAR
  leads to activation of the receptor associated Tyk2 and Janus kinase (Jak1) [].
  This is followed by the tyrosine phosphorylation (P) of STAT1 and STAT2, which can
  be blocked by statins in vitro[, ]. Activation of the STATs leads to formation of
  two transcriptional‐activator complexes which subsequently activate ISRE and GAS,
  respectively, in the nucleus. (B) IFN‐β and statins exert differential impact on
  modulation of cytokine responses and subsequently T‐cell differentiation. A diverse
  action of IFN‐β and statins was shown in vitro for Th1 cytokines IFN‐γ and IL12
  and Th2 cytokine IL10 []. IFN, interferon; IFNAR, IFN‐α/β receptor; STAT1, member
  of the Signal transducer and activators of transcription family of transcription
  factors; ISRE, IFN‐stimulated response element; GAS, IFN‐γ activated site; IL, interleukin;
  TNF, tumor‐necrosis factor.'
