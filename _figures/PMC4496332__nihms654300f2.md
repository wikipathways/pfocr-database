caption: 'ARDs share molecular pathologies affecting a common signaling pathway involved
  in activity-dependent protein synthesis in distal dendrites near spine synapses.
  The Ras/ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways couple synaptic activation of mGluR
  and the BDNF TrkB receptors to protein translation that is essential to the maintenance
  of LTD. Mutations in several regulators of these pathways, including the genes encoding
  the proteins TSC1/2, FMRP, DSCR1, UBE3A, and PTEN are responsible for ARDs. Loss-of-function
  mutations in the gene encoding the nuclear protein MeCP2, which causes RTT, result
  in lower levels of mGluR and BDNF, lowering the activation of those signaling pathways
  in response to glutamatergic synaptic activity and activity-dependent BDNF release.
  While mTOR is typically an activator of protein translation through 4E-BP and S6K,
  pathological increases in mTOR levels repress translation of LTD-specific proteins,
  though the exact mechanism(s) is unknown. Selective inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin
  alleviates autism-related deficits in FXS and TS, providing evidence that this pathway
  is causal in the pathological mechanisms leading to autism.Abbreviations: Glu: glutamate;
