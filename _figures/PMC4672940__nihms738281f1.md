caption: a | A cartoon model of the life cycle of Neurospora crassa. Neurospora grows
  from a single haploid spore into a multinucleated branched thread called mycelium.
  This vegetative stage continues as the mycelium expands and can originate new mycelia
  as colonies bud off and disperse (conidium stage). This cycle is asexual and continues
  until two colonies of opposite mating types (A and a) interact and give rise to
  a fruiting body. The fusion of the two haploid spores gives rise to a dikaryon that
  then proliferates within the fruiting body. After premeiotic DNA synthesis, nuclei
  of the opposite mating type fuse, and meiosis is initiated. Each of the meiotic
  spores then undergoes mitosis to give rise to an octad of haploid spores. This series
  of events constitutes the sexual cycle. b | A schematic representation of the unidirectional
  pathway from H3K9me3 to DNA methylation in N. crassa. The DCDC complex associates
  with H3K9 methyltransferase DIM-5 and targets it to certain chromatin loci to create
  the H3K9me3 mark. Once the H3K9me3 is established, the heterochromatin protein 1
  (HP1) can specifically recognize the H3K9me3 mark to facilitate targeting of the
  associated DNA methyltransferase DIM-2 to methylate DNA at the same sites.
