caption: When mice are fed an atherogenic diet, vascular calcification is induced
  if LRP1 is expressed in vSMCs. LRP1 positively regulates a Wnt5a signaling pathway
  that activates chondrogenic-specific genes in the vascular wall. PPARγ and its target
  sFRP2, by counteracting the prochondrogenic Wnt5 pathway, protect against vascular
  calcification. Conversely, in the absence of LRP1, Wnt5a signaling is inhibited,
  an event that promotes intracellular cholesterol accumulation and foam cell development.
