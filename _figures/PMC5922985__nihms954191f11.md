caption: '(a) The ARF model and of the p53 signaling pathway []. (b) Connectivity
  configuration for the model. Blocks 1–4 form a negative feedback loop (p53 production→Mdm2mRNA→Mdm2→Mdm2_p53→p53
  degradation) and Blocks 5–7 comprise a cascade reaction (IR event→damDNA→ARF→ARF_Mdm2→Mdm2
  degradation) which triggers an oscillation in the loop. Note that the rates of Mdm2-dependent
  p53 degradation (Reaction 4) and ARF-dependent Mdm2 degradation (Reaction 14) are
  propagated to the blocks that produce p53tot (Block 1) and Mdm2tot (Block 4), respectively.
  Note also that Mdm2 reacts with both p53 and ARF, so the fan-out configuration is
  used for Block 2 and 7. (a) Reprinted figure originally published in [C. J. Proctor
