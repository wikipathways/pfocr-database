caption: 'Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells have distinct CAR receptors with
  their own transduction pathways, separate from the TCR-mediated pathways, virtue
  of their variant extracellular, transmembrane, costimulatory, and intracellular
  activation domains. The signaling pathway is initiated upon CAR-T cells (a) binding
  to the extracellular ligands (signal 1: "activation"). Then, (b) co-stimulation
  (through signal 2) functions as a necessary co-activation signal, prior to (c) cytokine
  release (signal 3) that supports eventual CAR-T cell differentiation and ultimate
  activation'
