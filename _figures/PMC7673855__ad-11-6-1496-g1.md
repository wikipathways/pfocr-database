caption: 'Schematic pathway of PACAP signaling cascades. PACAP exerts function via
  activation of three different G-protein coupled receptors: PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2.
  The PAC1 has a 100-fold selectivity for PACAP over VIP, contributing to its role
  as the main functional receptor of PACAP. Each PACAP receptor is coupled primarily
  to Gs or Gq, which stimulate AC and PLC activation. In the AC-involved signaling
  pathway, AC accelerates ATP conversion to cAMP, which then prompts PKA phosphorylation
  and activation of EPAC pathway. In contrast, activation of PLC boosts the PKC pathway,
  and the IP3 activation to increase the intracellular Ca2+. Both PLC and AC/cAMP
  signaling pathways are related to the PACAP function by mediating downstream targets,
  such as the MAPKs family and the PI3K/Akt pathway. These pathways further mediate
  cell proliferation, differentiation migration, and survival through several nuclear
  genes, such as CREB, NF-kB, JAK and cJun. Besides, these downstream signaling pathways
  also appear to be directly activated by PAC1 and are paralleled with PLC and AC/cAMP
  pathway in some cells.'
