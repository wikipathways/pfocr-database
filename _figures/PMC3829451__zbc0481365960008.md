caption: β-Adrenergic receptors potentiate glutamate release at cerebrocortical nerve
  terminals. Shown is a scheme illustrating the putative signaling pathway activated
  by βARs. The βAR agonist isoproterenol stimulates the Gs protein, adenylyl cyclase
  thereby increasing cAMP levels. cAMP in turn activates Epac, which can promote PLC-dependent
  PIP2 hydrolysis to produce DAG. This DAG activates and translocates Munc13-1, an
  active zone protein essential for synaptic vesicle priming. Activation of the Epac
  protein also enhances the interaction between the GTP-binding protein Rab3A and
  the active zone protein Rim1α. These events promote the subsequent release of glutamate
  in response to Ca2+ influx. AC, adenylate cyclase.
