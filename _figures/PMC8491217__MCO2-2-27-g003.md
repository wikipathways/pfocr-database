caption: 'Signaling pathways in lipid metabolic reprogramming. (A) The PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway regulates lipid metabolism in cancer cells. PI3K/Akt can increase expression
  of FOXO1 leading to initiation of SREBP transcription. mTORC, a downstream target
  of PI3K/Akt signaling, can inhibit activation of LPIN, which will otherwise sequester
  SREBP and inhibit its translocation into nucleus. In addition, Akt can inhibit the
  activity of GSK3 to inhibit degradation of SREBP. (B) The Hippo signaling pathway
  regulates lipid metabolism in cancer cells. Noncannonical Hippo pathway regulates
  lipid metabolism through inhibiting the maturation of SREBP via preventing its translocation
  from ER to Golgi. LATS1/2 also promotes YAP/TAZ degradation, which will otherwise
  initiate the expression of FAO‐related genes to promote FA oxidation in cancer cells.
  In addition, YAP can also interact with SREBP in the nucleus to enhance its transcriptional
  activity and increasing expression of downstream targets such as HMGCR and fatty
  acids synthase. (C) p38 MAPK participates in the regulation of lipid metabolism
  via direct phosphorylation of PGC‐1α to facilitate recruitment of the coactivator
  to PPARγ target genes and driving chromatin remodeling, promoting PPARγ‐dependent
  gene transcriptionAbbreviations: ACLY, ATP‐citrate lyase; ACOX1, acyl‐CoA oxidase
