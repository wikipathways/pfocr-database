caption: Using isoprene, a C5 terpene compound, as a building block, larger terpene
  molecules are created. Bacterial hosts employ the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP)
  pathway (the non-mevalonate pathway, also called the DXP pathway) to synthesize
  isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). The Entner-Doudoroff
  Pathway [] or nDXP route (synthesis of 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate from pentose)
  [] can increase the flux of the MEP pathway. In contrast, eukaryotes employ the
  mevalonate (MVA) pathway to synthesize IPP. In S. cerevisiae, cytosolic acetyl-CoA
  generation can be promoted via the pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass or novel phosphoketolase
  shunt []. The newly discovered isoprenoid alcohol (IPA) pathway can convert pyruvate
  and acetyl-CoA to IPP and DMAPP [].
