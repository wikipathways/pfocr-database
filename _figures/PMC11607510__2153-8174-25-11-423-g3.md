caption: Glucose metabolism reprogramming of VECs. Pulsatile shear  stress (PS) activated
  AMPK, which can promote phosphorylation of the Ser-481 site  of GCKR to inhibit
  the activity of HK1. The expression of HIF-1α was  significantly upregulated after
  imposing LSS. HIF-1α stimulates GLUT1  and PFKFB3. Stimulated by hypoxia, GLUT1
  expression is upregulated and it  promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven
  HIF-1α accumulation.  Furthermore, hypoxia leads to the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase  (PDK), which can inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Lactate dehydrogenase
  A  (LDHA) can promote the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. In addition, the  activated
  proline hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) binds to pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), which  can also
  activate HIF-1α. High-glucose factors stimulate the expression  of PFKFB3 and PKM2.
  In addition, hyperglycemia can induce cells to produce  macromolecules and energy
  through glycolytic side pathways. The pentose phosphate  pathway (PPP) and the polyol
  pathway (PP) are side branch pathways of glycolysis.  G-6-P is suppressed to entry
  into the PPP under hyperglycemic conditions, which  leads to reduced proliferation
  and migration of VECs. Glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase deficiency increases ROS.
  In addition, the PP is also activated  under hyperglycemic conditions, glucose is
  converted to sorbitol by aldose  reductase, and sorbitol can be converted to 3-deoxyglucosone,
  a precursor of  advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). AMPK, amp-activated
