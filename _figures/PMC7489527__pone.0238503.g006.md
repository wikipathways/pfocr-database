caption: 'All metabolites are written in blue, whereas purple texts are referred to
  as cytokines and chemokine. The black texts either represent protein receptor/transporter/complex,
  enzyme/co-enzyme, or neuro signaling mediator. The dashed arrows represent the signaling
  pathway and various coloured arrows for metabolic pathways. The metabolites which
  have been identified in the 1H NMR spectra are in blue line boxes, whereas the orange-coloured
  line boxes are for the 21 suggested biomarkers. The abbreviations for mediators;
  NO = nitric oxide, IL = interleukin, MCP = monocyte chemoattractant protein, enzymes/coenzymes;
  iNOs = inducible nitric oxide synthase, NADP+ = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate, PKG/A = protein kinase G/A, cAMP/cGMP = cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases
  A/G protein kinase, protein receptors/translocators/complex; TLR = toll-like receptor,
  GLUT = glucose transporter, MCT = monocarboxylate transporter, NF-κβ = nuclear factor
  kappa light chain enhancer activated B cells, NMDA = N-methyl-D-aspartate, and GAT
  = GABA transporter. In the boxes, the up and down red arrows represent the increase
  and decrease of metabolites/cytokines and chemokine for LPS+CNE treated rats, where
  * indicates the significant difference of p<0.05 from the one-way ANOVA test, where
  # indicates the top four in OPLS analysis when compared to LPS+water treatment.'
