caption: During the initial phase of breast tumourigenesis, the TGFβ signal inhibits
  primary tumour development. Eventually, breast carcinoma cells cease to respond
  to TGFβ due to epigenetic silencing of its receptors or to aberrations in downstream
  SMAD sig-nalling, causing the switch of TGFβ's role from tumour suppressor to tumour
  promoter. A crosstalk of PPAR signalling with TGFβ pathway most likely interferes
  with both functions of this molecule. Most likely, the outcome of the PPAR/TGF crosstalk
  is defined by the net effects of the TZD-related shifts in the balance of the pro-tumourigenic
  and tumour suppressor molecules that belong to a number of pathways affected by
  PPAR.
