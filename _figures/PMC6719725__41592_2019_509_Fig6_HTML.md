caption: a–c, The modules are from the STRING protein–protein interaction networks
  and were generated using the consensus method. Node colors correspond to Pascal
  gene scores in the respective GWAS (). For the two inflammatory disorders (a,b),
  red squares indicate genes causing monogenic immunodeficiency disorders (enrichment
  P values of 4.1 × 10−8 and 1.2 × 10−6, respectively (one-sided Fisher’s exact test)).
  a, Module associated with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 25 genes, FDR-corrected Pascal
  P = 0.04) that is involved in T cell activation. A costimulatory pathway is highlighted
  green, T cell response is regulated by activating (CD28) and inhibitory (CTLA4)
  surface receptors, which bind B7 family ligands (CD80 and CD86) expressed on the
  surface of activated antigen-presenting cells. The therapeutic agent CTLA4-Ig binds
  and blocks B7 ligands, thus inhibiting T cell response. b, Cytokine signaling module
  associated with inflammatory bowel disease (n = 42 genes, FDR-corrected Pascal P = 0.0006).
  The module includes the four known Janus kinases (JAK1-3 and TYK2, highlighted green),
  which are engaged by cytokine receptors to mediate activation of specific transcription
  factors (STATs). Inhibitors of JAK–STAT signaling are being tested in clinical trials
  for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. c, Module associated with myocardial
  infarction (n = 36 genes, FDR-corrected Pascal P = 0.0001) comprising two main components
  of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway (endothelial nitric oxide synthases (NOS1-3) and
  soluble guanylate cyclases (GUCY1A2, GUCY1A3 and GUCY1B3), highlighted green), a
  key therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease.
