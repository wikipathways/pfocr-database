caption: Schematic of the findings in this study. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and
  Ras signaling pathway were activated in the Fvb mice and promoted breast cancer
  progression. The pathways regulating cellular senescence and apoptosis were enriched
  in the up-regulated DEGs in the Fvb.B6 mice and suppressed breast cancer progression.
  The oncogenic pathways validated by analyzing available human breast invasive carcinoma
  samples in TCGA database are indicated in red.
