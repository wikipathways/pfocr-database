caption: K63-linked poly-ubiquitylated interferon receptors (IFNAR1/2) are internalized
  and degraded via the lysosomal degradation pathway. The BRISC-SHMT2 complex is required
  for IFNAR1/2 deubiquitylation and receptor stabilization at the membrane. BRISC
  deubiquitylation of IFNAR1/2 receptors proceeds after SHMT2 displacement leading
  to sustained interferon signaling.SHMT2 dimer-tetramer transition is regulated by
  pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) binding. Only an inactive SHMT2 dimer can interact
  with BRISC, whereas the active SHMT2 tetramer will sterically clash with BRCC36-Abraxas2
  superdimer. Modulation of SHMT2 dimer-tetramer transition by PLP analogues or other
  binders could represent new ways to inhibit BRISC recruitment to IFNAR1/2 and reduction
  of interferon signaling.
