caption: Expression network analysis of DEGs in the plant − pathogen interaction pathway
  by KEGG analysis. CDPK, FLS2, EFR, and PR1 related to PAMP-triggered immunity were
  upregulated in F26 at 0 hpi and 24 hpi. RIN4, PBS1, RPS2, RPM1, and SGT1 related
  to effector-triggered immunity were also found to be upregulated at early time points
  in F26
