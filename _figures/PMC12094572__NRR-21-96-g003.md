caption: 'The molecular mechanisms of exercise-enhanced brain neuroplasticity by enhancing
  various peripheral factors.Physical exercise significantly increases ADPN levels
  and inhibits inflammatory factors in the blood to regulate glucolipid metabolism
  and insulin sensitivity. Exercise enhances mitochondrial function and oxidative
  stress by activating the ADPN-SIRT1-PGC-1α signaling pathway in skeletal muscles.
  In addition, exercise can enhance metabolism and insulin resistance by inducing
  ADPN signaling in the serum and increasing FGF21 sensitivity in the liver. Physical
  exercise enhances hippocampal adult neurogenesis and synaptic density and functions
  through the ADPN-AMPK signaling pathway and ADPN-Notch signaling pathway activation.
  In the hypothalamus, exercise promotes caloric restriction by increasing APPL1 protein
  levels and attenuating Drosophila TRB3 levels. Moreover, exercise affects the microbiota
  and cognition, which links the stimulation of the immune system (NLRP3, IL-1β, and
  caspase-1) and endocrine signaling, such as the hypothalamus‒pituitary‒adrenal axis,
  with the secretion levels of ADPN and the brain‒gut‒microbiota axis (Liu et al.,
  2013; Polito et al., 2020). Multiple actions could contribute to the pro-cognitive
  effects of physical exercise. Created with BioRender.com. CNS: Central nervous system;
