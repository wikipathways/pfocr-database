caption: 'The different activators of JAK/STAT that play an important role in the
  pathophysiology of PH. (A) The binding of the cytokine (IL-6 or IL-11) to its unique
  receptor (IL-6R or IL-11R) triggers the homodimerization of GP130. This results
  in the phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2, which phosphorylate intracellular
  tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for STAT3 in PH. (B) ET1 and Ang II
  exert their action through the activation of receptors that belong to a large family
  of transmembrane guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). JAK
  and STAT are constitutively expressed and directly coupled to this receptor. The
  binding of ETI/Ang II induces the phosphorylation of tyrosine in the JAK2 kinases,
  which in turn activates STAT1 and STAT3. In addition, ET-1 can stimulate the activity
  of PKC δ, which phosphorylates STAT3. (C) VEGFR and PDGFR are tyrosine kinase receptors.
  Ligand binding induces receptor dimerization (homo- or heterodimers) and the activation
  of the kinase domain. The activation of STAT1 and STAT3 can be mediated by JAK or
  TYK2 (the JAK-dependent pathway) or through the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity
  of growth factor receptors (the JAK-independent pathway). (D) Stimulation with TGFβ
  induces the phosphorylation of JAK2 and thereby activates STAT3, but the exact mechanism
  is still unknown. Activated STAT1 and STAT3 translocate to the nucleus, where they
  bind to cis-inducing elements and promote the transcription of early growth response
  genes, which leads to proliferation, angiogenesis, vasoconstriction, inflammation,
  and resistance to apoptosis, triggering PH. Abbreviations: Ang II: angiotensin II;
  ET1: endothelin 1; IL-6: interleukin 6; IL-11: interleukin 11; JAK: Janus kinase;
  PDGF: platelet-derived growth factor; PKC δ: protein kinase Cδ; STAT3: signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3; TGFβ: transforming growth factor-beta; VEGF: vascular
  endothelial growth factor. Created with BioRender.'
