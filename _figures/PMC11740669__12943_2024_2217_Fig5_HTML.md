caption: 'Innate immune system regulates two types of ICD through autophagy. The potential
  program may consist of three phases: the acute reaction phase, the autophagy promotion
  phase and the chronic reaction phase. During the acute reaction phase, TLR4 recognizes
  LPS and activates both TRIF and MyD88 signaling pathways. Subsequently, TAK1-TABs
  complex and IKK complex are activated in turn. Ultimately, NF-κB activation leads
  to nuclear translocation enabling NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β to initiate transcription.
  Meanwhile, the recognition of LPS by TLR4 triggers the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome,
  mediating NLRP3-Caspase-1-GSDMD pyroptosis and the release of IL-1β and IL-18. Intracellular
  LPS can directly activate caspase-4, caspase-5, and caspase-11 to induce GSDMD cleavage.
  Caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5 can cleave pro-IL-18, leading to IL-18 activation
  and triggering pyroptosis. The cGAS recognizes intracellular double-stranded DNA
  and catalyzes cGAMP formation. Next STING is activated, causing STING to translocate
  from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. As a consequence, TBK1 and
  IKKε kinases are recruited and phosphorylated, where TBK1, upon phosphorylation,
  inversely catalyzes STING phosphorylation. Simultaneously, IKKε kinase drives IκB
  phosphorylation to subsequent ubiquitin-mediated degradation, leading to removal
  of the inhibition of NF-κB. Ultimately, the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB
  drives multiple cytokine expression and secretion. Additionally, STING recruits
  NLRP3 to ER, where it deubiquitinates NLRP3, promoting inflammasome activation.
  Phosphorylated TBK1 phosphorylates P62. Phosphorylated P62 not only acts as an inflammatory
  mediator released extracellularly via the pyroptosis pathway, but also promotes
  autophagy. During the autophagy promotion phase, the STING pathway will be affected
  by autophagic degradation of STING via K63-linked ubiquitination. The ac4C in ULK1
  mRNA by NAT10 increased ULK1 expression. ULK1-mediated STING Ser366 phosphorylation
  inhibits the phosphorylation of STING at the same site by TBK1, inhibiting NLRP3
  expression, preventing pyroptosis and sustained innate immune signaling. If the
  activation signal of the innate immune system is difficult to eliminate, such as
  pathogens that have not been eliminated or DNA damage in the nucleus or mitochondria
  caused by the application of chemotherapy drugs and cellular senescence, the chronic
  reaction phase is entered. During the chronic reaction phase, STING directly binds
  NCOA4, decreasing the nuclear localization of NCOA4 and promoting ferritinophagy.
  Subsequently, increased LIP exacerbated mitochondrial damage and, together with
  other mitochondrial damage factors such as inhibition of the mtDNA replication and
  repair regulator POLG, inhibition of the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM,
  or mitochondrial fusion mediated by STING-MFN1/2 interactions, co-induced the release
  of mtROS and mtDNA. Additionally, cGAS-STING phosphorylates YAP via STING/TBK1/LATS1
  signaling axis, inhibiting YAP nuclear translocation and promoting its ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation. YAP inhibits ferritinophagy by disrupting the NCOA4-FTH1 interaction.
  Indirect inhibition of YAP by the cGAS-STING pathway then promotes ferritinophagy
  and mitochondrial damage. The activation of cGAS-STING requires GPX4. The pyroptosis
  pathway, GPX4 and the cGAS-STING pathway are inhibited with promoted autophagy.
  Consequently, promoted autophagy and excessive accumulation of lipid peroxidation
  become inevitable, leading cells toward ferroptosis'
