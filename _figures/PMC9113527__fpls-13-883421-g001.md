caption: Approaches for enhancing homologous recombination (HR) and gene targeting
  (GT) frequency in plants. (A) Sequence-specific nucleases can induce double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) at target loci. These nucleases include I-SceI, TALENs (TALE repetitive
  domain with FokI), ZFNs (Zinc-finger binding domain with FokI), Cas9, Cas12a, and
  Cas9 fusion proteins (Cas9-CtIP, Cas9-RAD52, and Cas9-Vir2). (B) Methods that can
  increase the dosage of donor templates in plants, encompassing biolistic, carbon
  nanotubes (CNTs), and geminivirus-based replicons (GVRs). (C) Modifications of donor
  template structure that result in higher HR efficiency. Altering the donor template
  symmetricity, labeling the 5′ or 3′ end of the donor template using phosphorothioate
  linkages or biotin, and attaching the donor template with histones as “mini-chromatin”
  can improve GT efficiency in plant cells. (D) Improved GT efficiency by genetic
  manipulation of the NHEJ and HR pathways. Knockout mutations in NHEJ pathway genes
  Ku70, Ku80, and Lig4, and the overexpression of HDR pathway genes RAD51, RAD52,
  and RAD54 can enhance HR efficiency in plants. (E) Strategies for bringing donor
  templates to target loci. These strategies include in planta gene targeting, delivery
  of the donor templates to the DSB during cell cycle phases when HDR occurs, conjugating
  the gRNA with the donor template, and attaching the donor template with the nuclease.
  (F) Environmental factors and hormones that alter HR efficiency. *Designates phosphorothioate
  modification at the end in donor template.
