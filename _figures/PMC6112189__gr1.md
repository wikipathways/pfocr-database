caption: The γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shunt metabolic pathway and its regulation
  in plants. The glutamine-synthetase/glutamate-synthase (GS/GOGAT) cycle is the principal
  nitrogen assimilation pathway into glutamate and amino acids in plants. The glutamate
  dehydrogenase (GDH) is thought to function primarily in glutamate catabolism but
  can also function in the opposite direction. The GABA shunt is composed of three
  enzymes (purple). Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a cytosolic enzyme regulated
  (green) by the Ca2+–calmodulin (CaM) complex, which catalyses the irreversible decarboxylation
  of glutamate to produce GABA. GABA is transported into the mitochondria, where it
  is converted into succinic semialdehyde by GABA transaminases using either α-ketoglutarate
  (by GABA-TK) or pyruvate (by GABA-TP) as amino acid acceptors. Succinic semialdehyde
  is then reduced by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) to form succinate,
  which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
