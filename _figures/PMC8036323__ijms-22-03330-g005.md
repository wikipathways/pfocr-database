caption: Cooperation of autophagy with phagocytosis in microglial activation. Autophagy
  and phagocytosis are tightly intertwined, making them promising therapeutic targets
  in Alzheimer’s diseases. Autophagy could be activated by activation of ULK 1. Interaction
  of Aβ with TREM2 and CD36 at the surface of microglia initiates phagocytosis, which
  is facilitated by autophagy mediators. LC3 recruitment to the single-membrane phagosomes
  is mediated by the activity of ATG 5 and ATG 7. Thereafter, Beclin1 and LC3 proteins
  translocate to the phagosomes, enhancing the fusion of phagosome into the lysosomal
  system. The interaction of autophagy and phagocytosis, through LC3-associated phagocytosis
  (LAP), enhances the efficiency of microglial phagocytosis in the elimination of
  extracellular cargos including Aβ aggregates. Rubicon’s activity is critical in
  the production of PtdIns(3)P at the phagosome, triggering the recruitment of the
  ATG5–12 and LC3-PE conjugation systems. On the other hand, toll-like receptors (TLRs)
  are involved in the induction of microglial autophagy. TLRs initiate signaling pathways,
  such as NF-κB. This pathway triggers the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors,
  such as NOS, COX2, NOX2, TNF-α, and pro-IL-1β, which are damaging to mitochondria,
  and consequently, induce the autophagic flux.

  description: Cooperation of autophagy with phagocytosis in microglial activation.
    Autophagy and phagocytosis are tightly intertwined, making them promising therapeutic
    targets in Alzheimer’s diseases. Autophagy could be activated by activation of
    ULK 1. Interaction of Aβ with TREM2 and CD36 at the surface of microglia initiates
    phagocytosis, which is facilitated by autophagy mediators. LC3 recruitment to
    the single-membrane phagosomes is mediated by the activity of ATG 5 and ATG 7.
    Thereafter, Beclin1 and LC3 proteins translocate to the phagosomes, enhancing
    the fusion of phagosome into the lysosomal system. The interaction of autophagy
    and phagocytosis, through LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), enhances the efficiency
    of microglial phagocytosis in the elimination of extracellular cargos including
    Aβ aggregates. Rubicon’s activity is critical in the production of PtdIns(3)P

    systems. On the other hand, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in the induction
    of microglial autophagy. TLRs initiate signaling pathways, such as NF-κB. This
    pathway triggers the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors, such as NOS, COX2,
