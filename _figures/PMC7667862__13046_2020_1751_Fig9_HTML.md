caption: A model for OTUD7B deubiquitination of TRAF3 and inhibition of NIK to suppress
  LCL161-induced lung cancer cell invasion and migration. LCL161 activates the non-canonical
  NF-κB pathway via NIK accumulation and processing of p100 to p52, increasing the
  mRNA levels of NF-κB target genes to promote lung cancer cell invasion and migration.
  OTUD7B deubiquitinates TRAF3 and inhibits NIK and NF-κB pathways to suppress LCL161-induced
  cell invasion and migration. C194S/H358R(CH) in the OTU domain of OTUD7B and OTUD7B(CH)
  cannot deubiquitinate TRAF3 and regulate pathways such as wildtype OTUD7B can

  via deubiquitinating TRAF3.
