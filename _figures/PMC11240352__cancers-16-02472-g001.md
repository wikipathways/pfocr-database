caption: Genetic and nongenetic mechanisms of CRC resistance to cetuximab. Briefly,
  genetic mechanisms of resistance include activating mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PI3K,
  and EGFR (red stars) and loss of function mutations in PTEN (purple star). These
  mutations in the EGFR signaling pathway lead to constitutive signal activation independent
  from EGFR activation, and this ultimately leads to increased cell proliferation
  and survival. Other resistance mechanisms include nongenetic modes of resistance,
  including the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through increased expression
  of EMT transcription factors like Snail and Zeb1, activation of parallel receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTK), and altered EGFR trafficking. These mechanisms are discussed
  more in depth in Section 4.1, Section 4.2, Section 4.3, and Section 4.4. Other resistance
  mechanisms that are not as well studied but nonetheless play a role in cetuximab
  resistance include maintenance of cancer stem cells and altered cellular metabolism.
