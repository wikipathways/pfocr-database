caption: 'Schematic representation of TRPV4 and TRPM8 signalling pathways relevant
  to the present study. Intracellular Ca2+ is released from the SR via the activation
  of two types of receptors/channels: IP3Rs and RyRs. GSK1016790A activates TRPV4
  channels, causing an influx of Ca2+ and Na+ in PA myocytes. TRPV4 can induce Ca2+
  release from the SR via stimulation of RyRs. At the same time, α-ARs, when activated
  by PhE, act through the Gq/11 signalling pathway, resulting in IP3-mediated Ca2+
  release from the SR. Ca2+ sparks activate closely located BKCa channels, causing
  STOCs, membrane hyperpolarisation and, finally, vasorelaxation. Simultaneously with
  these events, the openings of TRPV4 channels depolarise the membrane, thus inducing
  voltage-dependent activation of CaL (not excluding the possible involvement of some
  other signalling pathways, such as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), the α1-AR-TRPC3/TRPC6
  complex, etc.), which results in vessel depolarisation and contraction. Menthol
  activates SR and plasma membrane TRPM8 channels, initiating both Ca2+ release and
  Ca2+ influx in SM, as was shown in our previous study [13].'
