caption: Metabolic engineering strategies for redistributing the carbon flux to 2,3-BD
  by manipulating NADH levels. 2,3-BD is an NADH-dependent product; the NADH availability
  and its proportion in the active form play important roles in 2,3-BD production.
  But NADH oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. Lactate, one of the main
  by-products, competes with 2,3-BD for pyruvate as a metabolic intermediate and NADH
  as a cofactor. To block a pathway that competitively consumes NADH and to redirect
  carbon flux towards 2,3-BDO production, the NADH oxidase was disrupted by insertion
  of a formate dehydrogenase gene fdh, and then the pathway to lactate was blocked
  using the insertional mutation technique to disrupt the lactate dehydrogenase gene
  ldhA. (3-PGA 3-Phosphate glyceraldehyde, 1,3-BPG 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate, Red arrows,
