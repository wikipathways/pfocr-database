caption: Cytoplasmic recognition of HAdV DNA occurs through cGAS sensing. cGAS senses
  DNA and synthesizes cGAMP. Thereafter, cGAMP binds to the adaptor protein STING,
  triggering the activation of TBK1 and IRF3, initiating the production of type I
  IFN, specifically IFN-β. The TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway activation occurs during
  HAdV infection and regulates NF-κB and MAPK kinetics. Created by http://www.Biorender.com
