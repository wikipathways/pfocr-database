caption: Fish retinoic acid‐inducible gene I (RIG‐I) ‐like receptor (RLR) ‐mediated
  signalling pathways in response to viral and bacterial infections. Upon the recognition
  of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from viruses or bacteria, MDA5/RIG‐I
  recruits mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), an adaptor protein located
  on mitochondria, and then become associated with TRAF3, MITA and TBK1, leading to
  the phosphorylation and activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)/IRF7
  for translocating into nucleus and then for binding IFN‐stimulated response element
  (ISRE) motif, and to the production of type I IFNs and IFN‐stimulated genes (ISGs).
  In addition, NOD2 can interact with MDA5, RIG‐I as well as MAVS in the signalling
  pathway, and IRF10 can inhibit type I IFN production through binding ISRE motif
  and interacting with MITA. TBK1‐like (TBK1L) and PIAS4a negatively regulate the
  RLRs–MAVS–TBK1‐mediated signalling pathway. PVHL and the N protein of spring viraemia
  of carp virus could induce the degradation of MAVS and block MAVS‐mediated type
  I IFN production. In the signalling schematics, the negative regulation cascades
  are marked with red lines, and broken lines indicate that the exact PAMPs recognized
  by fish RLRs have not been determined or the direct interaction or mechanism of
  the indicated molecules need to be confirmed.
