caption: 'Impact of the cellular restriction factor APOBEC3 (A3) on human immunodeficiency
  virus-1 (HIV-1) replication. The HIV-1 replication cycle starts by infection of
  cells that express A3 proteins (producer cells). In the producer cells, viral infectivity
  factor (Vif) targets the A3 proteins for proteasomal degradation, but can also counteract
  the encapsidation of A3s by direct binding without degradation and by reducing the
  translation of A3 mRNA. If Vif is not expressed or does not bind to A3s, A3s are
  packaged into HIV-1 virions budding from the cells. During the next round of infection
  in target cells, encapsidated A3 proteins inhibit HIV-1. Single-stranded viral (−)
  DNA (generated by viral reverse transcription) serves as a substrate for A3-induced
  cytidine deamination, which causes G-to-A hypermutations in the viral (+) DNA. Additionally,
  the presence of A3 proteins inhibits reverse transcription and results in damaged
  ends in the double-stranded viral DNA. These inhibit integration. A3s also impair
  the integration of HIV-1 by binding directly to the integrase. The number of integrated,
  highly mutated proviruses is low. The base excision repair pathway replaces uracils
  with thymidines: Uracil-containing proviral DNA is first subject to removal of uracils
  by uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) bound to Vpr. The damaged DNA activates the DNA
  sensors ATR and ATM, triggering the DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR can upregulate
  expression of ULBP2, a ligand for natural killer cell (NK) receptor NGK2D that sensitizes
  HIV‑infected cells to NK cell lysis. In addition, A3s improve the recognition of
  HIV‑infected cells by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), as hypermutated proviruses
  encode mRNAs with missense and nonsense mutations that supply a pool of MHC-I-restricted
  HIV antigens. Killing of HIV-infected cells may result from a balance between these
  activating mechanisms and other viral pathways that repress cell recognition by
  NK cells and CTL.'
