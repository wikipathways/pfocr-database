caption: NGF binding to cell-surface TrkA receptor results in activated receptor complexes,
  which contain adaptors such as SHC (SH2-containing protein), GRB2 (growth-factor-receptor
  bound protein 2) and Gab (GRB2-associated binding) proteins. These proteins recruit
  the protein SOS, increasing Ras-guanosine triphosphate (Ras-GTP) levels by catalyzing
  nucleotide exchange on Ras. Ras also activates the PI3K-PDK1 (3-phosphoinosisitide-dependent
  protein kinase 1)- Akt pathway. The activation of TrkA by NGF leads to activation
  of multiple signaling pathways, including PLC-γ, PI3K, p38MAPK, and JNK signaling
  pathways and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/MAPK pathways. The activation of sigma-1 receptors
  on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by sigma-1 receptor agonists (e.g., SA4503 and
  fluvoxamine) might interact with IP3 receptors on the ER. Ca2+ released by the interaction
  between sigma-1 receptors and IP3 receptors may play a role in the potentiation
  of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Subsequently, several signaling
  pathways are implicated in the potentiation of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by
  sigma-1 receptor agonists.
