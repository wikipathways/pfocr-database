caption: Schematic diagram of the FCεRIγ signalling pathways. Two sets of experimental
  data were available in the literature for this pathway; Tsang et al. (2008)  and
  Faeder et al. (2003) . In this model, we simulated the phosphorylation of Grb2 and
  Syk downstream to the activation of FCεRIγ.
