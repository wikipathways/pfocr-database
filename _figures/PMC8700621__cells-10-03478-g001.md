caption: DEG IPSC interaction with neurons, neural stem cells, PD and biological processes,
  identified using key words “neurodegeneration”, “transport”, “vesicular”, “mitochondria”,
  “lysosome”, “oxidative stress”, “apoptosis” and “autophagy” according to Pathway
  Studio data. Genes, overexpressed in IPSC derived from twins with PD, as compared
  to IPSC derived from healthy twins are highlighted red. Genes, underexpressed in
  IPSC derived from twins with PD, as compared to IPSC derived from healthy twins
  are highlighted green.
