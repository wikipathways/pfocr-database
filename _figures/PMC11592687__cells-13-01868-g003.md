caption: Oxidative stress activates Hippo signaling pathway. Oxidative stress modulates
  NF2, PRX-I, cAbl, and MAPK to phosphorylate MST1/2. Simultaneously, MAPK inhibits
  YAP translocation. Meanwhile, GABP is inhibited by the presence of oxidative stress,
  which will inhibit expression of YAP/TAZ. All of these lead to the nuclear entry
  inhibition of YAP, which is responsible for the production of pro-proliferative
  and anti-apoptosis proteins. In addition, phosphorylated MST1 induces phosphorylation
  of FOXO3a and activates transcription of ΔNp63α, which inhibits cell migration,
  invasion, and metastasis. Concurrently, mild elevations in ROS activate NEDD4, which
  subsequently ubiquitinates LATS, thereby inhibiting its function
