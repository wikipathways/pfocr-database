caption: Schematic of liver glycogen 2H- and 13C-enrichment in seabass following administration
  of a glucose load enriched with [U-13C6]glucose ([U-13C6]Glc) while the fish are
  also in the presence of 2H-enriched tank water. The red circles represent glycogen
  13C-isotopomers derived from direct pathway metabolism of [U-13C6]glucose and the
  pink circles indicate triose and glycogen isotopomers formed via indirect pathway
  metabolism of [U-13C6]glucose. The blue shading represents positional glycogen enrichment
  from 2H2O. This includes glycogen synthesized from alanine and other endogenous
  amino acids that are converted to glycogen via Krebs cycle anaplerosis and gluconeogenesis
  (Endo-Krebs cycle) as well as glycerol released by lipolysis (Endo-Glycerol). Pre-existing
  glycogen may also become enriched in position 2 from 2H2O via futile cycling of
  glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate (indicated by grey dashed arrow).
