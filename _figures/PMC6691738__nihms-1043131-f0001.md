caption: 'Human adrenal steroidogenesis pathway showing mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid,
  and androgen synthesis. Chemicals were chosen for screening in the Leydig cell assay
  based on observed changes in substrates upstream of testosterone synthesis that
  were detected by the HTS H295R steroidogenesis assay. Category 1 chemicals elicited
  a decrease in 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and did not decrease testosterone. Category
  2 chemicals induced 11-deoxycorticosterone synthesis but did not decrease testosterone
  synthesis. The predominant pathways to corticosterone and testosterone in the rat
  are depicted with the large, shadowed arrows. Abbreviations: CYP11A1, cholesterol
  side chain cleavage; CYP17, 17α-hydroxylase/17, 20 lyase; 3β-HSD, 3β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase-D 5,4 isomerase; CYP21, 21-hydroxylase; CYP11B1, 11β-hydroxylase;
  CYP11B1/B2, 11β/18-hydroxylase; 17β-HSD, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; CYP19,
  aromatase.'
