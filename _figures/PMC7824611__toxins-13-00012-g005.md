caption: Proposed model of Cholix-induced cell death pathways. The cell death signal
  pathways in HepG2 cells [], hepatocytes [,], and HeLa cells [] are shown. This figure
  is described in the “Conclusion”. Marvin ChemAxon was used for drawing ADP-ribosylated
  diphthamide (https://www.chemaxon.com).
