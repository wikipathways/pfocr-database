caption: 'A mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway transduces and integrates
  intrinsic and environmental signals during stomatal production. A signal transaction
  cascade involving the MAPKKK YDA, MKK4/5 and MPK3/6 is employed to repress stomatal
  production. The EPFL-ERf-TMM module (including the antagonistic STOMAGEN) functioning
  within the stomatal lineage lies genetically upstream of YDA, activating it through
  an as yet unknown mechanism. The activated stomatal MAPK module can regulate stomatal
  development at multiple stages. Shown here is its repression of meristemoid production
  by MPK3/6 phosphorylation and downregulation of SPCH that is initiated upstream
  by the EPF2-ERECTA pair. The downstream targets of the MAPK pathway activated by
  the EPF1-ERL1 pair are not known. An intermediate signaling component in the brassinosteroid
  (BR) pathway, the GSK3-like kinase BIN2, interfaces with the stomatal development
  pathway at two levels: by phosphorylating and inhibiting YDA (thus increasing stomata)
  and by phosphorylating and repressing SPCH (thus decreasing stomata). Light also
  regulates the number of stomata through the ubiquitin E3 ligase COP1, a central
  repressor in light signal transduction. Genetic evidence has placed YDA downstream
  of COP1 but the nature of their molecular link is not known. Arrows indicate positive
  interactions, T-bars negative interactions. Solid lines indicate confirmed biochemical
  interactions and dashed lines are indirect or genetic interactions. BAK1, BRI1-ASSOCIATED
