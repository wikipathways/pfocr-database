caption: Viral proteins manipulate DDR signaling pathways to promote viral propagation.
  During infection, aberrant DNA structures or DNA damages caused by virus replication
  are recognized by DDR sensors/transducers as host defense mechanisms. On the other
  hand, viral proteins such as LANA, v-cyc, and ORF36 activate DDR proteins to modulate
  the cell cycle in the S-phase to promote viral replication. Since apoptosis decreases
  the opportunity for viral propagation, many viral proteins such as LANA, vIRF1,
  and vFLIP inhibit apoptosis and promote cell survival. The activation of the apoptotic
  pathway following the DDR occurs via p53, but because viral proteins deregulate
  this pathway, the risk of tumorigenesis is increased.
