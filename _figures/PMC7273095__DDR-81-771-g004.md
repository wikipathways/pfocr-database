caption: 'Androgen pathway in COVID‐19 infection. Red arrows show the steps that are
  targeted by androgen blockers, which include: GnRH analogs (Degarelix, Goserelin,
  Leuprolide, Leuprorelin, Nafarelin), which stop LH secretion and induce chemical
  castration. Dutasteride and Finasteride are 5‐alpha‐reductase inhibitors, which
  are safe for men and women after menopause, because dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is
  the most potent intrinsic androgen hormone. Testosterone is regarded as the main
  androgen hormone, its production in inhibited by ketoconazole, an inhibitor of steroidogenesis.
  Androgen receptor inhibitors may be steroidal, such as Abiraterone, Cyproterone,
  Nomegestrol, or Spironolactone; or nonsteroidal (Apalutamide, Bicalutamide, Darolutamide,
  Enzalutamide, Flutamide, and Nilutamide). TMPRSS2 blockers include Bromhexine, Camostat,
  and Nafamostat'
