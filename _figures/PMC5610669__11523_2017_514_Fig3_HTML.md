caption: Examples of IGF-targeted agents. Anti-IGF-1R mAbs block ligand–receptor interactions
  and induce receptor internalization and degradation [–]. Small molecule TKIs bind
  to the receptor tyrosine kinase domain and block signaling downstream of IGF-1R
  and INSR [–]. IGF ligand-neutralizing mAbs bind to and neutralize both IGF ligands,
  thereby blocking the activation of IGF-1R and INSR-A [, ]. Agents shown in gray
  have only been evaluated preclinically. Agents in italics are in ongoing clinical
  trials as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-cancer treatments. Clinical
  development of all other agents shown has been terminated. IGF-1/−2 insulin-like
  growth factor ligand 1/2, IGF-1R type 1 IGF receptor, INSR insulin receptor, mAb
  monoclonal antibody, TKI tyrosine kinase inhibitor
