caption: Scheme summarizing transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel
  isoforms dysregulated under myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemia and reperfusion.
  TRPC1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are upregulated in mouse and rat animal models of MI [,,].
  Compelling evidence indicates that TRPC channel overexpression contributes to Ca2+
  entry, mediating the activation of Ca2+-sensitive signaling pathways, such as calcineurin–NFAT,
  a critical pathway involved in apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis [,,,,].
  TRPC proteins are likely also involved in cardiac repair-related processes. The
  protective role played by TRPC6 in wound healing is of note []. Other studies suggested
  a role of TRPC channels, such as TRPC5, in angiogenesis and revascularization triggered
  post ischemia [].
