caption: 'Late (green box) biotin biosynthesis is conserved in all biotin-synthesizing
  organisms and is catalyzed by the action of four enzymes: BioF, BioA, BioD, and
  BioB, which convert pimeloyl-ACP/CoA to biotin. Synthesis of the pimeloyl-ACP moiety
  differs between bacteria. In E. coli (red box), BioC methylates malonyl-ACP to form
  malonyl-ACP methyl ester, which then enters the fatty-acid elongation pathway. BioH
  demethylates pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester to form pimeloyl-ACP (). In contrast, B.
  subtilis (blue box) utilizes BioI to break down long-chain fatty acids into pimeloyl-ACP.
  A secondary pathway exists in which free pimelic acid is converted to pimeloyl-ACP
  by BioW ().'
