caption: During cortical neurogenesis, ventricular progenitors (blue) withdraw from
  the cell cycle (pink) and start to differentiate and migrate to their specific destinations
  to form cortical layers. Exposure to cocaine during neocortical development causes
  rapid ROS accumulation in ER via cytochrome P450 dependent N-oxidative metabolism.
  ROS-induced oxidative ER stress leads to activation of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 pathway.
  ATF4 represses the transcription of cyclin A2 in neural progenitor cells. Blocking
  cell cycle progression by cyclin A down-regulation may result in fewer immature
  neurons migrating into the cortex to form the cortical layers. I, III, IV, V, and
  VI, cortical layers I, III, IV, V, and VI; IZ, intermediate zone; SP, superficial
  portion of the intermediate zone; SVZ, subventricular zones; VZ, ventricular zone.
  Up-regulation or activation of transcripts or proteins is denoted by ↑; down-regulation
  or inactivation of transcripts or proteins is denoted by ↓. Changes indicated by
  red arrows were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR or Western blot analysis
  in this study.
