  WaaP and WaaY add phosphoryl substituents to heptose residues I and II, respectively.
  WaaC, WaaP and WaaF are required for plaque formation by phage LL5. WaaC, WaaF and
  WaaG are required by LL12, and absence of WaaP (checkmark and “X”) results in a
  ~50-fold reduction in plating efficiency for phage LL12. Panel A is adapted from
