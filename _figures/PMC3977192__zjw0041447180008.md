caption: 'LTP pathway components and interacting proteins: response in hippocampus.
  Components of the LTP pathway imported from the KEGG database are outlined in and
  their connections are indicated with solid red lines. Complexes are indicated by
  their components if at least one component was measured by RPPA; otherwise the complex
  name is used (e.g. CAM). Primary protein interactions involving proteins measured
  by RPPA are indicated in ovals and connected to pathway components by dashed lines.
  Pathway components and interacting proteins are color coded according to experimental
  responses: solid yellow, changed in NL only; solid blue changed in NL+M only; solid
  green changed in both NL and NL+M. White stripes indicate proteins that were changed
  in M. Color coding does not discriminate increases and decreases, or nuclear from
  cytosolic or membrane. See – and supplemental Table S3 for magnitude and direction
  of changes. Gray, no change in any condition. White, components of the LTP pathway
  that were not measured. *, human ID protein and/or mouse protein that results in
  L/M or synaptic plasticity deficits when mutated ().'
