caption: Targeting TGF-β signalling. Firstly, by inhibiting TGF-β from being translated
  and transcribed. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) (Trabedersen), siRNAs, or
  DNA enzymes can all inhibit the transcription or translation of TGF-β mRNA. Secondly,
  inhibition of latent TGF-β activation. Fibrosis can be treated with anti- αvβ6 integrin
  antibody while αvβ6 integrin activates TGF-β, and anti-αvβ6 antibody decreases collagen
  production and partially inhibits TGF-activity. Thirdly, Inhibition of activated
  TGF-β binding to its receptor by ligand trapping. TGFβRII/Fc, which consists of
  the extracellular domain of the TGFβ type II receptor combined with an immunoglobulin
  heavy-chain Fc fragment, efficiently hindered TGFβ1 to binding with the extracellular
  receptor. Fourthly, by blocking intracellular TGF-β signalling. Galunisertib is
  an oral inhibitor of TGF-β type I receptor kinase, and it inhibited the phosphorylation
  of Smad2/3, thereby blocking TGF-β signalling. TGF-β signalling is mediated via
  non-SMAD pathways, including PI3K/AKT, ERK and JNK, which can lead to ECM creation
  and myofibroblast activation. PI3K/AKT, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase
  B; ERK(MAPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. (The
  grey arrow means promotion and the T bar means inhibitory effect.)
