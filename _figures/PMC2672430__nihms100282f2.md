caption: Under normal levels of pO2 HIF-1α is rapidly degraded via an ubiquitination
  pathway. Although not well studied, moderate levels of hypoxia are known to activate
  HIF-1 by a p300 independent pathway that results in limited gene transcription.
  However, hypoxia induces HIF-1 by activation of p300 and binding with both HIF-1a
  and HIF-1β that in turn activates a hypoxic response element (HRE). This molecular
  cascade results in full transcription of over 70 different genes of which a few
  general physiological processes are illustrated. Both activation and inhibition
  of HIF-1 occur via the actions of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and factor inhibiting
  HIF-1 (FIH). PHD is sensitive to O2 levels for activation. PHD and FIH act to activate
  HIF but the co-activator p300 is required for full transcription of genes related
  to HIF-1.
