caption: Mechanism of vascular inflammation mediated by microparticles and target
  of baicalin. Endothelial cell (EC), vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), and macrophage
  cell activation in response to various stimuli such as ROS, LPS, tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL) lead to the production of endothelial microparticle
  (EC-MP), smooth muscle cell-microparticles (VSMC-MP) and macrophage microparticles
  (MØ-MP) respectively. EC-MP increases the ROS production in EC, thereby reduce phosphorylated
  ENOS and Akt expression followed by a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) production (a
  potent vasorelaxant). VSMC-MP stimulates VSMC to express matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9), leading to the degradation of the elastic lamina barrier and ease VSMC
  migration to the site of the atherosclerotic lesion. Furthermore, VSMC-MP also upregulates
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) (ERK, JNK, P38) pathway and
  PCNA protein expression leading to proliferation and migration of VSMC to develop
  vascular inflammation. EC-MP and platelet microparticles (PMPs) possesses cell adhesion
  molecules that support the adhesion of various circulating cell the endothelial
  cell followed by altered intimal permeability and vascular lesion at a later stage.
  MØ-MP activated macrophage to uptake oxidized LDL and change in foam cell. This
  activated form of macrophage is responsible for the overexpression of nitric oxide
  (NO) and the procoagulant factor causing vascular inflammation. As a whole, all
  of this pathway leads to atherosclerosis. The target of baicalin to inhibit vascular
  inflammation is shown by the red line.
