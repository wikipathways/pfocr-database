caption: 'In the canonical pathway, the three TGF-β ligand isoforms, TGF-β1, TGF-β2,
  and TGF-β3, are synthesized as precursors and bind to form the latent TGF-β complex
  before being secreted[]. After extracellular activation, TGF-β ligands bind to the
  membranous TGF-β type III receptor or the TGF-β type II receptor (TGF-βRII) homodimers
  with high affinity. TGF-βRII binding allows dimerization with TGF-β type I receptor
  (TGF-βRI) homodimers, activation of the TGF-βRI kinase domain and signal transduction
  via phosphorylation of the C-terminus of receptor-regulated SMADs (R-SMAD), SMAD2
  and SMAD3. The TGF-βR dimer then forms a heterotrimeric complex with SMAD4 which
  translocates and accumulates in the nucleus[, ]. TGF-β dependent signalling can
  activate or repress hundreds of target genes through the interaction of SMADs with
  various transcription factors (TF). SMAD activities are regulated through several
  mechanisms: SMAD2/3 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, binding to anchor proteins such
  as SARA, phosphorylation (e.g., by ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK), Smurf (SMAD-ubiquitination-regulatory
  factor)-dependent degradation, or via expression of inhibitory SMAD6 and SMAD7[].
  In the non-canonical pathway, TGF-β signalling activates SMAD-independent pathways
  such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK pathways (ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK) as well as NF-κB, Rho/Rac1,
  Cdc42, FAK, Src, Abl[]. Moreover, transversal signalling, especially at the SMAD
  level, allows TGF-β pathway activation to integrate signals from integrins, Notch,
  Wnt, TNF-α, or EGF-dependent pathways as well as signals from cellular processes
  such as the cell cycle or apoptosis machineries[]. The TGF-β signalling pathway
  thus has pleiotropic functions regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis,
  cell motility, extracellular matrix production, angiogenesis and cellular immune
  response[].'
