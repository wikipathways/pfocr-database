caption: 'Schematic diagram of the underlying mechanism of Paeonia lactiflora P. in
  Parkinson’s disease. The diagram of a nigro-striatal synapse shows three possible
  approaches that can be used as therapeutic targets. Parkinson’s disease is caused
  by the early death of dopaminergic neurons in midbrain substantia nigra leading
  to the reduction of dopamine neurotransmitters released to the striatum, so treatment
  could be either targeting the degeneration process as disease-modifying therapy
  (presynaptic, right side of the diagram), or synaptic transmission as symptomatic
  treatment (postsynaptic, left side of the diagram). The putative targets of Paeonia
  lactiflora P. are located on three pathways: the green arrows from TNF, IL-6, to
  CASP8, CASP3 are part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway induced by neuroinflammation,
  the yellow arrows from CASP9 to CASP3 with the involvement of AKT1, BCL2, and PTGS2,
  belong to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, and blue receptors DRD1, DRD2, ADORA2A,
  SLC6A3 and AKT1 are related to the regulation of neurotransmitters level. TNF, Tumor
  Necrosis Factor; IL-6, Interleukin 6; CASP8, Caspase-8; CASP9, Caspase-9; CASP3,
  Caspase-3; PTGS2, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2); BCL2, Apoptosis regulator Bcl-2; AKT1,
  RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (PKB); ADORA2A, Adenosine receptor A2a;
  DRD1, Dopamine D1 receptor; DRD2, Dopamine D2 receptor; SLC6A3, Sodium-dependent
  dopamine transporter.'
