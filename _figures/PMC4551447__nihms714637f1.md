caption: The finding of genomic heterogeneity of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC)
  has profound implications, not only for our understanding of the critical factors
  associated with the initiation and evolution of this disease, but also for the development
  of effective targeted therapeutic strategies. This diagram shows genomic heterogeneity
  that can be found within different regions of a CCRCC. The ‘truncal’ VHL gene is
  mutated in all regions, and could be targeted with with agents such as sunitinib,
  pazopanib or axitinib. The ‘branch’ mutations, present in selected regions of the
  tumour, can occur in genes for which potential targeted therapies exist, or in genes
  for which no current targeted treatment exists, such as SETD2, BAP1 or SMARCA4.
  Thus, the most effective strategy may involve combinatorial approaches targeting
  the ‘truncal’ VHL-HIF pathway, or a more global strategy that includes targeting
  ‘branch’ chromatin remodeling gene pathways.
