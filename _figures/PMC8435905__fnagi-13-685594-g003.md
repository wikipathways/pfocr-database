caption: Abbreviated versions of the early steps in the neutral (left, in purple)
  and the cerebral 25-hydroxylase (right, in brown) pathways of bile acid biosynthesis.
  Pathway from 7-dehydrocholesterol and cholesterol to 3β,7β-diHCA(25R) are also shown
  as is the path to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in red and black dashed boxes, respectively.
  Enzymes, metabolites, and reactions of the neutral pathway are in purple, those
  of the 25-hydroxylase pathway are in brown, while those generating 3β,7β-diHCA(25R)
  are in red. Enzymes/genes expressed in brain, and metabolites observed in CSF are
  in bold. Italics indicate that the named structure is one of a number of possibilities.
  Enzymes in italics are postulated catalysts. [O] indicates oxidation via non-enzymatic
  mechanism. Thick coloured arrows pointing upwards or downwards indicate significant
  positive or negative correlations even when the confounding variables are considered.
  Red triangles indicate significance ignoring confounding variables, in at least
  one of the two studies. The full stereochemistry and numbering system for cholesterol
  and 7-DHC is indicated. Abbreviated structures are shown for other sterols ignoring
  ring-stereochemistry.
