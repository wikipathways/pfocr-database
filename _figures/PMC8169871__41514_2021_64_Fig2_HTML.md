caption: Alterations in brain metabolite concentrations and brain gene expression
  related to cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism in AD. Metabolites indicated
  in bold (non-italics) and in a box (e.g., Lanosterol) were measured and detectable
  in the study in the ITG and MFG in the BLSA and ROS cohorts. Genes indicated in
  bold and in a box (e.g., CYP46A1) were measured and detectable in the ERC, hippocampus,
  and visual cortex in GEO datasets. Metabolites or genes not in bold and not in a
  box (e.g., Lathosterol) were not measured or detectable. Genes indicated in a hexagon
  (e.g., HSD3B7) regulate reactions that are predicted by metabolic network modeling
  to be significantly different between AD and CN samples. a De novo cholesterol biosynthesis
