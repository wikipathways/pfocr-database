caption: In normal nutrient conditions, CPT1C is bound to malonyl-CoA and its N-terminal
  domain acquires the folded conformation (Nα), which enhances the transfer of kinesin-1
  (KIF5) from protrudin to FYCO1, which promotes the plus-end transport of LE/Lys
  and axon growth. However, under energy stress, such as glucose depletion or the
  activation of AMPK pathway, N-regulatory domain of CPT1C switches to its extended
  conformation (Nβ). In this state, CPT1C does not enhance the transfer of kinesin-1
  to FYCO1, and in consequence, the anterograde transport of LE/Lys is not promoted
  and axon growth arrested. CPT1C and protrudin are bound in both situations, but
  the way they interact with each other changes with metabolic stress.
