caption: Cryoglobulin. Anti-viral core-protein IgG antibodies provoke an IgM-rheumatoid
  factor antibody response, which fixes and activates complement through the classical
  pathway . C1q binding to its receptor on the endothelial cells localizes the immune
  complexes to target tissues such as skin, lung, nerve and kidney. C1q propagates
  the complement cascade leading to formation of C4b C2b complex, which is a C3 convertase.
  C3 is thus split into C3a and C3b, the latter being a C5 convertase that splits
  C5 into C5a and C5b. C3a and C5a are chemotactic; they recruit neutrophils and trigger
  an inflammatory response. C5b interacts with C6-C9 to form C5-9 (Membrane Attack
  Complex [MAC]) which, besides the inflammatory process, may be directly involved
  in endothelial injury.
