caption: The protective signals of limb IPC may be transmitted to remote target organs
  like the kidney via different communication mechanisms, including humoral mediators,
  neurogenic pathways, and systemic regulation of immune-competent cells. These mediating
  pathways function on the kidney and activate the reperfusion injury salvage kinase
  (RISK) pathway (involving PI3K/Akt signaling) and the survivor activating factor
  enhancement (SAFE) pathway (involving JAK/STAT3 signaling), both of which have been
  shown to converge on GSK3β. GSK3β is situated at the nexus of a number of pivotal
  signaling cascades and controls NFκB phosphorylation, Nrf2 nuclear exclusion and
  degradation, as well as the opening of the mitochondria permeability transition
  (MPT) pore. Inhibition of GSK3β in the kidney following limb IPC desensitizes MPT,
  reduces proinflammatory NFκB activation, and stabilizes Nrf2 in the nucleus in kidney
  cells, resulting in pro-survival/anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory
  and antioxidant effects, which contribute to limb IPC–conferred kidney protection
  against various injuries elicited by contrast media or other insults. GSK3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; JAK, Janus kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RISK, reperfusion
  injury salvage kinase; SAFE, survivor activating factor enhancement; STAT3, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription 3.
