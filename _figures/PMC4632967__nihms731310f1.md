caption: 'Tumor antigen processing and presentation: This model demonstrates that
  there are many types of proteins or glycoproteins expressed by tumor cells that
  can be recognized by T cells of the immune system. The tertiary structure of the
  surface mucins or surface glycoproteins that are the product of reactivated embryonic
  genes, or the tertiary structure of over-expressed growth factor receptors such
  as HER-2/neu, can be recognized by soluble antibodies secreted by B cells. However,
  these same proteins or glycoproteins can be internalized into endocytic vacuoles,
  and then traf ficked either into the lysosomal antigen processing pathway to generate
  MHC class II bound tumor antigens via the exogenous pathway or into the cytoplasm
  where they will be degraded into MHC class I bound tumor antigens via the endogenous
  pathway. Tumor cells do not usually express MHC class II. Therefore, most tumor
  antigens will not be presented for MHC class II presentation to CD4+ helper T cells.
  However, the surface tumor antigens that will enter the cytoplasm will be degraded
  into small peptide fragments by the proteasomes (a, b). The small peptide fragments
  will then be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they will bind
  to MHC class I (c ) and subsequently be presented on the tumor’s surface bound to
  MHC class I molecules, and recognized by the cytotoxic T cell (d) tumor’s surface
  bound to MHC class I molecules, and recognized by the cytotoxic T cell (d). Any
  protein within a tumor cell, whether it is presented on the cell surface, expressed
  in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or endoplasmic reticulum, can gain access to the cytoplasm
  for processing and presentation on MHC class I molecules and be recognized by cytotoxic
  T cells. B2M beta-2 microglobulin, TAP transporter associated with antigen processing.'
