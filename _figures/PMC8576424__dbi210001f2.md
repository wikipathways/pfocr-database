caption: A model depicting a molecular mechanism involved in the actions of brain
  GIP signaling. Increased GIP associated with obesity activates the GIP receptor
  expressed by the hypothalamus, which in turn stimulates the cAMP-EPAC-RAP1 signaling
  cascade. Activation of the pathway results in the induction of SOCS3 and reduces
  neural leptin and insulin actions, thereby mediating dietary obesity. EPAC, the
  exchange factor directly activated by cAMP; GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic
  polypeptide (or gastric inhibitory polypeptide); SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling
  3.
