caption: 'Ligand binding to CRF1 receptor activates at least three Gα subunits (αs,
  αi and αq) of G-protein resulting in stimulation cAMP production by adenylate cyclase
  (AC) with subsequent cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CREB and activation of the
  cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Mobilization of calcium (Ca+2) results in activation
  of the calcium-responsive element (CARE). Activation of AP-1 can also trigger the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through protein kinase A (PKA).
  In addition, αq-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C results in IP3-driven activation
  of activator protein 1 (AP-1) dependent promoters. Downstream signaling from CRF1
  receptor regulates expression of several genes including POMC, several interleukins,
  involucrine and cytokeratin 14. The phenotypic effects of stimulation include: stimulation
  of differentiation, steroidogenesis, melanogenesis and release of arachidonic acid.
  CRF inhibits cell division and regulates immune response. See text and citations
  within for details.'
