caption: The hepatic metabolism of BPs and disruption of liver enzyme activity. The
  diagram illustrates the liver metabolism of BPs, which involves key liver enzymes
  from the Uridine 5 diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferase
  (SULT) families. This process aims to reduce the toxicity of these compounds and
  eliminate their hormonal activity, with the exception of BPB glucuronide and BPS
  glucuronide, which still exhibit estrogenic activity after liver metabolism. In
  pathological conditions such as obesity and diabetes, abnormalities in UGT activity
  lead to an increase in unconjugated BPs in the body, which resemble beta-estradiol
  and contribute to metabolic pathway disturbances and interactions with estrogen
  receptors
