caption: 'DMGs in the KEGG ''Toll-like receptor signaling'' pathway. The methylation
  status at the promoters of genes within the pathway is shown. The coloring scheme
  is as follows: yellow are hyper-methylated in RA, blue are hypo-methylated in RA
  and green contain no significantly DML in their promoters.'
