caption: Signaling pathways coupled to the M1 mAChR. Upon activation, the M1 mAChR
  principally couples to Gαq proteins to activate phospholipase C (PLC) enzymes to
  catalyze the membrane lipid substrate, phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  into inositol trisphophate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates protein
  kinase C (PKC), which is anchored to the M1 mAChR via a direct interaction with
  the scaffold protein, A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)-79. This AKAP-PKC complex
  activates the potassium M-channel (Kv7/KCNQ), permitting the influx of potassium
  (K+) into neurons to regulate neuronal excitability. IP3 activates the IP3 receptor
  (IP3R) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, releasing calcium (Ca2+) from the intracellular
  stores to the cytosol. Ca2+ activates intracellular signaling proteins, such as
  calcineurin, which can in turn activate some adenylate cyclase (AC) isoforms. PKC
  activates phospholipase A (PLA)2, which increases cytosolic arachidonic acid (AA),
  releasing amyloid precursor proteins (APP) and driving the formation of toxic amyloid-β
  (Aβ) plaques in Alzheimer's disease. The M1 mAChR also couples to Gαs and Gαi/o
  proteins, which can directly activate or inhibit AC, respectively. Activated AC
  converts cytosolic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the second messenger, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP can in turn, activate signaling proteins such
  as protein kinase A (PKA) or exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC).
  PKA phosphorylates and activates cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which
  increases gene transcription from cAMP response elements (CRE). Genes with CRE promoter
  regions are linked to improved cognition. The M1 mAChR couples to Gα12/13 proteins,
  which activate Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), Rho guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor 1 (p115RhoGEF), resulting in cytoskeletal rearrangements and neurite outgrowth
  retraction. Phospholipase D (PLD) is activated by either Gα12/13 proteins or the
  small GTPase adenosine diphosphate-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins, to induce
  long-term depression. The Gβγ-subunits are also linked to signal transduction, through
  activation of phosphoinosotide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt). Akt activates
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 which is linked to decreases in
  Aβ levels and decreases in Tau protein phosphorylation. Akt inhibits the activity
  of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β, a kinase that is associated with increases
  in Aβ and Tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease. M1 mAChR signaling is
  regulated by phosphorylation of the receptor at serine and threonine residues located
  in intracellular loops and carboxy-terminal tail, by kinases including GRK2. GRK2
  phophorylation promotes the recruitment of β-arrestin scaffold proteins that promote
  M1 mAChR internalisation via clathrin-coated pits through interactions with the
  adaptor complex, AP2 protein, clathrin and dynamin. Additional M1 mAChR internalization
  may occur via recruitment of caveolins, through clathrin-independent pathways. Recruitment
  of scaffold proteins such as, β-arrestin and 14-3-3 are also linked to ERK1/2 activation
  and increases in transcription from CRE elements. Dashed arrows indicate pathways
  requiring further work to characterise the signaling proteins involved in the pathway.
  Solid arrows represent experimentally determined interactions. Proteins that are
  disrupted in Alzheimer's disease are colored in purple, those disrupted in schizophrenia
  are colored in blue and those disrupted in both diseases are colored in green.
