caption: Schematic diagram of the involvement of the cholinergic system in gintonin-mediated
  anti-Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through LPA receptor activation. In our previous report,
  we showed that gintonin attenuated amyloid plaque formation and ameliorated learning
  and memory dysfunctions (Hwang et al., 2012). In this study, we found that gintonin
  stimulates the cholinergic systems by acetylcholine release and the increase of
  ChAT expression and protective effects against acute Aβ-induced and long-term cholinergic
  dysfunctions in the transgenic AD animal model. Gintonin-mediated activation of
  LPA receptors could be coupled to anti-AD effects via dual actions of the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway and modulations of the cholinergic system in the brain according to the
  described pathways.
