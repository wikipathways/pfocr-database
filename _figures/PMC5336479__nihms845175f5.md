caption: (A) A volcano plot of the log2 ratio of the averages of Her2 positive cell
  line- derived pY-IP enriched phosphopeptide intensities to the corresponding averages
  from Her2 negative cell lines plotted against the adjusted p value (probability
  that the ratio being different from 1 is due to random chance). Phosphosites with
  adjusted p value less than 0.005 were denoted in red. Selected phosphosites were
  labeled with their gene names. (B) Ingenuity pathway analysis suggested the ErbB
  signaling pathway was highly enriched. Proteins with a higher phosphorylation level
  at any site in this pathway were highlighted in red.
