caption: Functions and its signaling pathways of Panx3 in osteoblast differentiation.
  The Panx3 hemichannel releases intracellular ATP into the extracellular space. This
  released ATP binds to purinergic receptors in an autocrine or paracrine manner.
  This activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which in turn
  activates the Panx3 ER Ca2+ channel and releases Ca2+ from the ER. Upon Ca2+ binding,
  calmodulin (CaM) activates calcineurin (CN) signaling pathways. This activates the
  transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells calcineurin-dependent 1
  (NFATc1) by CN-mediated dephosphorylation. Activated NFATc1 then translocates into
  the nucleus and promotes Osterix expression. This in turn induces the expression
  of osteoblast genes, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (Ocn). Panx3
  also promotes degradation of p53, an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation, by
  activating the Akt/mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) pathway. In addition, the
  Panx3 gap junction propagates intracellular Ca2+ to neighboring cells to promote
  osteoblast differentiation.
