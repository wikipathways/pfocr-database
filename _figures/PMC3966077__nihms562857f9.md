caption: We previously demonstrated that GSH depletion is required for the execution
  phase of apoptosis (1) []. In this work we report that GSH depletion depends on
  the activity of initiator caspases 8 and 9 (2). Interestingly, GSH depletion and
  its stimulation enhance initiator caspase cleavage (broken lines) during apoptosis
  induced by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. This is explained by the fact
  that caspase activation is not a unidirectional event and that in type II cells
  (Jurkat), death-receptor pathway relies on the amplification of the signaling cascades
  by BID activation and translocation to the mitochondria (3). Finally we present
  compelling evidence that MRP1 transporterd are not involved in GSH depletion and
  apoptosis induced by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways as MRP1 inhibitors and
  other structurally unrelated OA− stimulate GSH loss (4) []. GSH-T (putative GSH
  transporter), OA− (organic anions such as MK571), Cyt C (cytochrome C), FADD (Fas-Associated
  protein with Death Domain), BID (Bcl-2 Interacting Domain), BH3 (BH3 only proteins
  such as BID and BIM which induce oligomerizarion of Bax or Bak and release of Cyt
