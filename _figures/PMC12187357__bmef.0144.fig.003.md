caption: NF-κB causes EMT-induced drug resistance. Different factors such as TNF-α,
  Notch1, isoflavone genistein, microRNA-497, and oxymatrine affect NF-κB pathway.
  Induction of NF-κB pathway leads to increase of mesenchymal transcription factors
  such as vimentin, Zeb1, and Zeb2, which leads to EMT and drug resistance
