caption: Biochemical pathway map incorporating differential analysis of metabolites
  (in boxes), combining the results of ICU vs. ward analysis (background colour) with
  the paired analysis of ward patients’ recovery status (frame colour). Correlation
  of metabolites with immune parameters (in ovals) is indicated by blue (positive)
  or red (negative) dashed lines. In a metabolite name, x and y denote various isomers,
  as depicted in the results of the study (see  for complete results). Enzymes are
  in ovals over reaction arrows. Acetylated COX acts similarly to the corresponding
  LOX. COX, cyclooxygenase; cPLA2, cytosolic calcium-dependent PLA2 (high selectivity
  to AA-containing phospholipids); iPF2a, 8,12-iPF2-alpha IV; iPLA2, cytosolic calcium-independent
  PLA2; PGS, prostaglandin synthases; sEH, soluble epoxide hydrolase; sPLA2, secretory
  PLA2; TXS, thromboxane synthases. The figure was created with BioRender.com.
