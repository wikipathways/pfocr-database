caption: 'Combinatorial targeting of OxPhos and BCL2‐family proteins in MYC‐associated
  lymphoma. Schematic summary of the pharmaco‐genetic interactions described in this
  work. Dashed arrows represent indirect effects; the connections between MYC, the
  integrated stress response (ISR), and the pro‐apoptotic BCL2 arm (thin arrows) were
  described in other studies (see text) and may further reinforce the sensitivity
  of MYC‐overexpressing cells to ETC inhibitors. Among a number of other pathways,
  MYC supports mitochondrial respiration (Oxphos): inhibition of this process, and
  in particular of ETC complex I by IACS‐010759 is synthetic‐lethal with MYC, pointing
  to Oxphos as an important effector in MYC‐induced tumorigenesis. Mechanistically,
  IACS‐010759 induces apoptosis through activation of the ISR and in particular its
  pro‐apoptotic effector CHOP and may independently impact BCL2‐family proteins. MYC
  sensitizes to apoptosis by modulating the expression of BCL2‐family members (and,
  not shown here, activation of the ARF/p53 pathway). Hence, the ISR and MYC activity
  converge on the BCL2 family to lower the apoptotic threshold upon IACS‐010759 treatment.
  This model provides a coherent rationale for the effects reported in this work,
  including (a) MYC‐induced sensitization of B cells to killing by IACS‐010759 and
  (b) the cooperative cytotoxic action of IACS‐010759 and BH3‐mimetic compounds, in
  particular venetoclax in MYC/BCL2 DHL cells, and S63845 in Mcl‐1‐expressing DLBCL
  and Burkitt’s lymphoma cells.'
