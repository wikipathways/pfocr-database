caption: Neighborhood of over-represented pathways in the breast cancer signaling
  networks. The three significantly over-represented cell-cycle-related pathways'
  strict overlaps and the corresponding 1-extended nodes in the breast cancer signaling
  networks are connected, and a selected neighborhood of them is depicted in this
  figure. The pathways are "metaphase to anaphase transition", "cyclosome regulatory
  network" and "Aurora B cell cycle regulation". Those nodes of the strict network
  which belong to at least one of these pathways are depicted in green, those strict
  nodes which do not belong to a pathway are depicted in yellow, and those which belong
  to the 1-extended but not to the strict one in red. Inhibitory arcs are depicted
  in red, blue-colored arcs comprise non-inhibitory semantics such as activation and
  binding. The red nodes strongly enhance the network's connectivity. All paths from
  cyclosome to p53 pass at least one red node. The interaction between the three nodes
  Aurora B, cyclosome and p53, and thus the metaphase/anaphase-cell cycle-functional
  module only appears in the 1-extended network since securin, MAD2B and BRCA1, crucially
  involved in spindle assembly and spindle checkpoint, are not part of the strict
  but included in the 1-extended network.
