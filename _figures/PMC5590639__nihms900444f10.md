caption: Schematic illustration of possible interactions between PVN inflammation
  and sympathoexcitation in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The activation of HMGB1
  occurs as a result post-translational modifications which involves acetylation of
  the box B components. This is also associated with the cytoplasmic translocation
  of the protein. Depending on its redox state, HMGB1 either binds to TLR4 or CXCR4
  to promote inflammation or leucocyte migration in the nervous system. The activities
  of MAPK in HMGB1 signaling facilitate the release of downstream molecules (NF-κB).
  Furthermore, it increases the release of transcriptomes (Nurr1 and Pitx3; not investigated),
  which favors the production of tyrosine hydroxylase (catecholaminergic activity).
  MAPK also increases the presynaptic releases of glutamate (vesicular glutamate activity)
  and control catecholaminergic neurotransmission; thus affecting sympathoexcitation.
  In a separate pathway, HMGB1 promotes the depletion of nNOS and depletes the “inhibitory”
  GABAergic system; further promoting sympathoexcitation. Change in the expression
  pattern of IGF-1R may play important roles in the control of inflammation and sympathoexcitation.
  Through the activation of CamKIIα, IGF-1R reduces the rate at which HMGB1 activates
  NF-κB. Similarly, CamKIIα phosphorylates MAPK/Erk1/Erk2 to reduce the progression
  of inflammation mediated through TLR4. Ultimately, IGF-1R and its secondary messenger
  molecule (CamKIIα) interact with catecholaminergic receptors at synaptic terminals
  to exert control on the activation of ionotropic glutamatergic receptors.
