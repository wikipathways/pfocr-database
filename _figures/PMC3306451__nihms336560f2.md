caption: Potential integration of mitochondrial oxidative and antioxidant pathways
  by PGC-1α. PGC-1α gene expression is induced by cAMP signaling through protein kinase
  A (PKA) phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. This pathway is observed
  upon β-adrenergic receptor activation during thermogenesis in brown fat. PGC-1α
  is also activated by posttranscriptional phosphorylation by AMPK or by deacetylation
  by SirT1 in response to nutrient deprivation. Induction or activation of the coactivator
  can enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative function through the coactivation
  of multiple transcription factors involved in respiratory gene expression (green
  pathway). PGC-1α activation may also promote an antioxidant environment by combining
  with ERRα in the induction of SirT3, a mitochondrial sirtuin that can trigger ROS
  detoxification (red pathway).
