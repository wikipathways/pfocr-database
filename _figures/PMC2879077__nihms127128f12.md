caption: In contrast to the phenylthiolate derivatives, the 2-mercapto-1-t-butylimidazolyl
  complexes [mimBut]HgR react rapidly with PhSH at room temperature. However, instead
  of cleaving the Hg–C bond, PhSH cleaves the Hg–S bond to give PhSHgR (). The different
  reaction pathway is most likely a consequence of the presence of the sp2 nitrogen
  lone pair on the [mimBut] ligand, protonation of which provides an alternative mechanism
  than one involving direct reaction with the Hg–C bond (). Supporting this suggestion,
  the proposed {[HmimBut]HgR}+ (R = Me, Et) intermediates may be synthesized independently
  via addition of HmimBut to [RHg][BF4], as illustrated in . The molecular structure
  of the ethyl derivative {[HmimBut]HgEt}[BF4] has been determined by X-ray diffraction
  () and the Hg–S and Hg–C bond lengths are similar to those of the neutral counterpart,
  [mimBut]HgEt ().
