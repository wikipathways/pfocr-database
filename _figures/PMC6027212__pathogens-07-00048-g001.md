  brucei (B), highlighting the contrast between canonical mammalian cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway and the African trypanosomes’ cAMP signaling, which mainly concentrates
  in the flagellum and is characterized by the almost total absence of polII transcriptional
  regulation. (A) In mammals, ligand (triangle) binding activates GPCR, which undergoes
  a conformational change and then activates the G proteins by promoting the exchange
  of GDP/GTP associated with the Gα subunit, triggering its dissociation from the
  Gβ/Gγ dimer to activate type III AC. AC produces cAMP from ATP. High local levels
  of cytosolic cAMP lead to activation of PKA holoenzyme, which binds the AKAP through
  a hydrophobic dimerization domain of the PKA-R subunit, Epac or CNG channel. Upon
  cAMP binding to PKA-R, PKA-C subunits dissociate, then translocate to the cell nucleus,
  and induce the phosphorylation of transcription factors, such as CREB, to activate
  cAMP-driven genes. CREB inactivation is promoted by a phosphatase (e.g., PP-1).
  PDE and MRP decrease intracellular cAMP levels and counterbalance the intracellular
  cAMP effect. (B) In T. brucei, a putative ligand (circle) or membrane stress (hypotonic,
  acidic, proteolytic) activates flagellar type III AC (prototype ESAG4 in bloodstream
  form). This AC is topologically similar to receptor-type GC and produces cAMP from
  ATP. In T. brucei no classical PKA effector is activated by cAMP; instead, the cAMP
  targets are CARPs, components of unknown function, which participate in a putative
  novel cAMP signaling pathway. RSP represents an AKAP-like protein linked to the
  flagellar axoneme (RSP3/AKAP97-like); PFR represents the parafagellar rod structure
  of the flagellum, which is linked to PDEs (TbPDEB1/B2). No CNG channels or Epac
  have been characterized in trypanosomatids, and there is no evidence for cAMP secretion
  via membrane channels. AKAP, A-kinase anchoring protein; CBP, cAMP-binding protein;
  CARP, cAMP response protein; CNG, cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel; CRE, cAMP-response
  elements; CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; EPAC, exchange protein directly
  activated by cAMP; Gαs, stimulatory G protein alpha subunit; Gβγ, G protein beta
