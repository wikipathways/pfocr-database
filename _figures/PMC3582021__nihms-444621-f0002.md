caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for iso-MGS (1) featuring the iso-MGS AT-less
  type I PKS that lacks a dehydratase (DH) domain in module-4, a MT domain in module-5,
  a KR domain in module-8, and a KR and an ER domain in module-10 according to the
  co-linear PKS model for the biosynthesis of the two nascent products, 10 and 13,
  and the tailoring enzymes MgsIJK with broad substrate specificity that convert 10
  to 12 and 13 to 1. Biosynthesis of the glutarimide starter unit by the loading module,
  module-2 and module-3 has been previously proposed. Heavy arrows denote the preferred
  pathway by the tailoring enzymes with thin arrows accounting for metabolites resulted
  from substrate promiscuity. ACP, acyl carrier protein; AMT, amidotransferase; DH,
  dehydratase; ER, enoylreductase; KR, ketoreductase; KS, ketosynthase; MT, methyltransferase;
  TE, thioesterase. [NH2] depicts the amino donor for the AMT domain, [SAM] denotes
  S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor for the MT domain, the ACP domain with
  an overlaid X is nonfunctional, the domain with ? denotes an unknown function, green
  ovals depict AT-docking domains, and the yellow domains highlight the missing domains
  for the iso-MGS AT-less type I PKS predicted according to the co-linear model for
  the biosynthesis of 10 and 13.,
