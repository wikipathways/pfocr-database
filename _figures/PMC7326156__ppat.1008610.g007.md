caption: NDV infection activates the host cap-dependent translation machinery to benefit
  viral translation and replication. NDV enhances eIF4E and eIF4G phosphorylation
  to promote eIF4F assembly and accelerate translation initiation by concomitant upregulation
  of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 MAPK/Mnk1 pathways. Activated mTOR enhances translation
  initiation machinery through phosphorylation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1
  and S6K1/rpS6. rpS6 phosphorylation may contribute to the sustained translation
  of host 5’TOP mRNAs which encode ribosomal protein, thereby facilitating the production
  of progeny viruses by supporting viral mRNA translation. In addition to phosphorylate
  eIF4E, p38 MAPK/Mnk1 signaling pathway also maintians 4EBP1 hyperphosphorylation
  and vrial protein synthesis to be resistant to rapamycin treatment. Finally, NDV
  NP protein can bind to eIF4E and facilitate the selective translation of viral mRNAs
  based on the involvement in cap-dependent translation during NDV infection by associating
  with polysomes and the ability to suppress host mRNA translation in vitro and in
  vivo.
