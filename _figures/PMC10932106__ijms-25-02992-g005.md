caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms underlying heat exposure-induced early
  pulmonary fibrosis-like changes. Heat exposure induced DNA damage in mice lung tissues,
  which subsequently led to the activation of the cGAS–STING signaling pathway, further
  inducing lung cell senescence and ultimately leading to the development of early
  pulmonary fibrosis-like changes
