caption: Schematic representation of the study. CD34+ HSPCs were isolated via Mac-sorting
  from cord blood and characterized for GLP-1R transcript and protein expression levels,
  and downstream signaling pathway activation. Then, CD34+ HSPCs were expanded in
  HG condition with or without LIRA (A). In a different experimental setting the cells
  were treated with LIRA only after the loss of glucose tolerance (B). CD34+ HSPCs
  cultured in NG (30 mM mannitol) condition were used as control (A, B). Proliferation,
  migration and oxidative stress were finally assessed at the end of experiments.
  GLP-1R = glucagone-like peptide 1 receptor; HG = high glucose; LIRA = liraglutide;
  NG = normal glucose
