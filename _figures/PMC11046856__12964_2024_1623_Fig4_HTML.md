caption: Crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and TGF-β signaling pathways during
  wound healing. During the inflammatory response, the Notch signaling pathway is
  activated and interacts with necrosis factor kappa B (NFκB) to induce production
  of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The crosstalk between
  β-catenin and Notch has been reported from the onset of injury. However, it is unknown
  if this crosstalk is activated at the start of the inflammatory phase or start of
  the proliferative phase. Nevertheless, this crosstalk has been shown to activate
  expression of C-MYC and HES1, which are both expressed at the overlap of the inflammatory
  phase and proliferative phase. At the proliferative phase all three of these pathways
  are activated, possibly in a temporal manner. It has not been indicated if NICD
  directly binds to β-catenin for the crosstalk between these pathways. We hypothesize
  that there is temporal crosstalk between Notch (NICD) and β-catenin as transcriptional
  co-activators at the proliferative phase. Β-catenin is known to interact with SMAD3
  however it is uncertain if this interaction occurs via CBP/p300 at both the proliferative
  and remodeling phases. Notch signaling has also been indicated to negatively regulate
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling during osteogenic proliferation, while Wnt/β-catenin inhibits
  Notch signaling during osteogenic differentiation. This interplay has however, not
  been shown in cutaneous wound repair. We hypothesize that this interplay is also
  involved in cutaneous wound repair in a temporal manner, where β-catenin inhibits
  Notch activity during tissue remodeling for the trans differentiation of fibroblasts
  to myofibroblasts as well as for formation of the new ECM for scar formation and
  wound closure

  description: Crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and TGF-β signaling pathways
    during wound healing. During the inflammatory response, the Notch signaling pathway
