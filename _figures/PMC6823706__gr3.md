caption: Molecular mechanism of inflammatory adipokines involved in the pathogenesis
  of diabetic associated fatty liver disorders via suppression of insulin signaling
  resulting in insulin resistance. PI3K-AKT signaling pathway regulates metabolic
  processes such as glucose uptake (muscle and adipocytes), glycogen synthesis (muscle
  and liver), protein synthesis (muscle and liver), and gluconeogenesis (liver). Inflammatory
  adipokines, TNF-a, IL-6, LPS, and saturated free fatty acid, activate inhibitory
  molecules such as SOCS and JNK to suppress insulin signaling resulting in insulin
  resistance. PI3K dependent PDK1 activation is negatively regulated by phosphor lipid
  phosphatase such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) that degrade PIP3. IRS2,
  insulin receptor substrate-2; FOXO1, Forkhead box protein O1; PC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; G6Pase, glucose-6-phosphatase; PIP3, phosphatidyl
  inositol (3, 4, 5)-triphosphate; Th17, T helper 17 cells; DMPs, damage-associated
  molecular patterns; MAPK, Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K-AKT, phosphatidyl
  inositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B.
