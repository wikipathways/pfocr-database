caption: Based on our finding, the lack of M062R during MYXV infection induces cGAS-dependent
  IFN-I production that is also regulated by SAMD9. The SAMD9 effect is at the upstream
  of the 2’3’-cGAMP production but does not significantly affect cGAS protein synthesis.
  Overall, SAMD9 plays a positive role in enhancing cGAS-dependent IFN-I induction
  and regulating the proinflammtory responses in our model system (the dotted line).
