caption: Overview of oncogenic pathways activated in T-ALL, the downstream signalling
  network of interleukin-7 (IL-7), NOTCH1, and polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2),
  and potential therapeutic targets. Binding of cytokine to the IL-7 receptor complex
  results in dimerisation of the receptor complex, which consequently phosphorylates
  JAK, as the cytokine receptor itself lacks intrinsic biological activity. Activated
  JAK1 and JAK3 induce phosphorylation of the STAT5 transcription factor, which, following
  dimerisation, translocates into the nucleus and stimulates gene expression. In addition,
  JAKs activate other downstream signalling cascades including PI3K–mTOR and RAS,
  which rationalises the use of combinations of inhibitors to promote cell death.
  STATs can also bind to the enhancer region of genes and modulate the epigenetic
  status of genes by depositing activating or repressive epigenetic marks through
  the direct recruitment of PRC2 members, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or through
  regulation of their transcription. Abnormal NOTCH1 signalling can enhance IL-7R
  signalling. When the NOTCH1 receptor is activated in response to Delta-Serrate-Lag2
  (DSL) ligand, signalling is then mediated by intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN), which functions
  as a transcription factor. Translocation of ICN to the nucleus and recruitment of
  co-activators subsequently activates downstream gene expression. Lightning bolts
  represent the proteins that are mutated in T-ALL. Red proteins are pathway regulators.
  Potential inhibitors of the proteins and pathways are indicated. BET Bromodomain
  and Extra-Terminal motif, HAT histone acetyltransferase, HDACi histone deacetylase
  inhibitor.
