caption: The interplay among the skin barrier, immune system, and nervous system in
  patients with AD. Skin barrier disruption promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines
  from keratinocytes, leading to immune activation, particularly of the Th2 pathway.
  Th2 cytokines initiate the inflammatory process by recruiting and activating more
  immune cells to the dermis. Simultaneously, various pruritogens are released, activating
  the cutaneous nerve fiber terminals. The itch sensation can be transmitted by histamine-dependent
  or histamine-independent pathways. Neuropeptides are released by efferent fibers
  and stimulate the immune cells to exacerbate the inflammatory process. Moreover,
  scratching triggered by an itch may further damage the skin barrier, leading to
  a vicious cycle.
