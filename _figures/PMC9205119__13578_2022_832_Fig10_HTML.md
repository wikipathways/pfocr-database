caption: Schematic diagram shows that the activation of astrocyte IL-1R/NF-κB/C3 signaling
  and microglial C3aR/APT2/DHHC7 palmitoylation mediates the pathophysiology of depression.
  Complement C3 is over-expressed by astrocyte IL-1R/NF-κB/C3 pathway in response
  to stress. Astrocyte-neuron crosstalk mediates through the release of complement
  C3 from astrocyte and the localization of C3 with neurons. Astrocyte-microglia crosstalk
  mediates through C3-C3aR chemotaxis. Microglia-neuron crosstalk acts through APT2/DHHC7
  mediated C3aR-STAT3 activation and synaptic pruning
