caption: Schematic representation of the activation of RAGE axis in Sars-Cov-2 infected
  cells in DM patients. Hyperglycemia enhances the production of RAGE ligands that
  prompt viral replication and increase RAGE signaling activation thus contributing
  to NRLP3 inflammasome priming and activation. Cytokine production and HMGB1 passive
  secretion contribute to dysregulated immune cell responses like M1 macrophages polarization,
  NETs formation, altered Th17 lymphocytes differentiation, thus paving the way for
  the cytokine storm. The preexisting endothelial dysfunction of DM patients and the
  ability of HMGB1 to activate platelets contribute to the pathogenesis of lung-centric
  and eventually multiorgan intravascular coagulopathy. Side panel shows druggable
  targets of molecular and clinical intervention. Targeting the RAGE pathway may represent
  a useful and feasible strategy for controlling severe ARDS and coagulopathy, particularly
  in DM patients. DPP4, Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4; SGLT2, Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter
  2; LMWH, Low Molecular Weights Heparins.
