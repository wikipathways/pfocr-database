caption: Molecular alterations in cortisol-producing benign adrenal cortical neoplasms.
  In normal physiology, cortisol production by adrenal zona fasciculata cells is mediated
  by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway.
  In the resting state, PKA is an inactive tetramer, with two catalytic subunits (PKA-C)
  bound to two regulatory subunits (PKA-R). Under stress, the pituitary gland produces
  corticotropin (ACTH), which binds to melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R), causing activation
  of adenylyl cyclase (AC) through stimulatory G-protein α stimulatory subunit (Gsα)
  and generating cAMP from ATP. The cAMP then binds to PKA-R, causing the release
  of PKA-C and phosphorylating (P) downstream elements, including cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB), enabling cortisol synthesis. Cyclic AMP is hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase
  (PDE), and the PKA subunit is reassembled again, returning to its inactive state.
  In adrenal Cushing syndrome, molecular alterations implicating PKA-C (PRKACA), PKA-R
  (PRKAR1A), Gsα [G-protein alpha subunit (GNAS)], PDE (PDE8B, PDE11A), MC2R, and
  aberrant G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been identified in cortisol-producing
  adenomas. These molecular alterations are thought to result in autonomous cortisol
  production and cellular proliferation through aberrant activation of the cAMP/PKA
  signaling pathway.
