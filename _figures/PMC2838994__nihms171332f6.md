caption: All factors implicated by our data in the somatic ERI pathway are included
  in the model. The dashed line through the center represents a conceptual division
  between the primary and secondary phases of the pathway; our data do not exclude
  more complicated feedback mechanisms in either direction. The Argonautes labeled
  with a “?” are included to indicate that NRDE-3 may be one of multiple Argonautes
  with a substantial role in the secondary phase. The NIHMS has received the file
  ‘mmc1.pdf’ as . The file will not appear in this PDF Receipt, but it will be linked
