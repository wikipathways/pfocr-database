caption: Molecular hypothesis of tumor progression in uveal melanoma, highlighting
  the role of PRAME reported herein. Increased PRAME mRNA expression in Class 1 uveal
  melanomas is associated with transcriptional up-regulation of key genes involved
  in chromosome maintenance and stability, many of which are located on chromosome
  1q and 6p and contain regulatory elements for transcription factors that interact
  with PRAME, including the retinoic acid receptor and NFY complexes. These observations
  suggest a possible feed-forward mechanism in which progressively increasing PRAME
  expression and specific chromosomal gains mutually reinforce one another to promote
  Class 1 tumor progression. There was a significant association of this pathway with
  SF3B1 mutations, which were mutually exclusive with EIF1AX mutations, suggesting
  a bifurcated pathway. This Class 1 metastatic pathway was distinct from the more
  common pathway leading to metastasis through the bi-allelic loss of BAP1 and acquisition
  of the Class 2 gene expression profile.
