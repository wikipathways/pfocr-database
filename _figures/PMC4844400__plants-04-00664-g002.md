caption: 'SL biosynthesis and signaling pathway. The SL precursor carlactone is produced
  from β-carotene by three enzymes, β-carotene isomerase, CCD7, and CCD8. MAX1 is
  CYP711A, a member of the cytochrome P450 family, and acts as an oxidase for conversion
  of CL to SL. D14 (α/β-hydrolase) and F-box protein form an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase
  complex required for SL signaling. D53 is targeted for degradation by the SCF complex
  in SL signaling. Gene color coding: red, Arabidopsis; blue, rice; green, pea; orange,
  petunia.'
