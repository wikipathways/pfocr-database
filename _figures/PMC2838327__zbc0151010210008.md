caption: Proposed model for the temporal regulation of the Wip1 promoter by the p38
  MAPK-p53 and JNK-c-Jun pathways. After UV irradiation, p53 is immediately activated
  by various kinases and then induces the Wip1 promoter. Later, p53 is dephosphorylated
  or inactivated by negative regulators such as Mdm2 and Wip1, and the JNK-c-Jun pathway
  thus ultimately becomes the major activator of the Wip1 promoter.
