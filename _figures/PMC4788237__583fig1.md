caption: 'Transcriptional regulators in C. elegans vulval induction. The C. elegans
  vulva is derived from an equivalence group consisting of six vulva precursor cells
  (VPCs), named P3.p through P8.p from anterior to posterior. A localized LIN-3/EGF
  signal from the anchor cell (AC) in the somatic gonad activates a LET-23/EGFR-LET-60/Ras-MPK-1/ERK
  signaling cascade strongly in P6.p. ERK activation in P6.p modulates transcription
  factor activity in the nucleus (only LIN-1 is shown here for simplicity), leading
  to induction of the 1° cell fate. In P5.p and P7.p, a weak LIN-3/EGF signal combined
  with lateral Notch signaling from P6.p (not depicted) instead produces the 2° cell
  fate. In P3.p, P4.p, and P8.p, the EGFR signaling cascade is not activated by LIN-3/EGF,
  and cells adopt the nonvulval 3° cell fate. Transcriptional regulators of the EGFR
  signaling pathway are critical for correct vulval cell fate specification: e.g.,
  the MDT-23/SUR-2 Mediator subunit is a coactivator of EGFR signaling-induced transcription,
  the SynMuv corepressor complexes are required to inhibit ectopic lin-3/EGF transcription
  in the hypodermis (Hyp7) surrounding the VPCs, and the MDT-12/DPY-22 Mediator subunit
  is required to inhibit vulva development by mechanisms that remain unclear (dashed
  arrow). The GTPase activating protein GAP-1 that negatively regulates LET-60/Ras
  activity post-translationally is also shown.'
