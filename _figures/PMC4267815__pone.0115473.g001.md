caption: In this signaling cascade, ligand activation of the membrane bound G protein-coupled
  receptors such as the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) results in the dissociation of
  the Gα,s subunit from the receptor. Gα,s then activates adenylyl cyclase (AC). Once
  stimulated, AC produces cAMP by cyclizing intracellular ATP. cAMP then activates
  a serine/threonine kinase known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase—or protein kinase
  A (PKA). The regulatory subunits of PKA are then released and the catalytic subunit
  acts on many downstream targets including the cAMP-response element-binding (CREB)
  protein. Phosphorylated CREB (phospho-CREB) binds to cAMP response elements (CREs)
  with the promoter regions of various genes including SMN2. cAMP signaling is attenuated
  by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) which break down cAMP into AMP.
