caption: The lipid droplet as a source of AA for lipid mediator production. (i) The
  direct hydrolysis of the phospholipid monolayer by cPLA2α (red) is considered the
  major pathway. The free AA produced could either be used for eicosanoid synthesis
  or reacylated into neutral core lipids such as triacylgycerol. (ii) The action of
  sPLA2 (green) on the phospholipid monolayer provides an alternative route for AA
  mobilization. (iii) Release of AA from the inner core triacylglycerol, a process
  initiated by ATGL (brown), can provide additional free fatty acid for eicosanoid
  synthesis or to replenish the fatty acid lost in the phospholipid monolayer by the
  action of cPLA2α and/or sPLA2.
