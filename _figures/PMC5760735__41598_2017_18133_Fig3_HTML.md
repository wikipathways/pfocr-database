caption: Comparison of transcripts coding flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes in leaves
  of purple-leaf mutants and wild-type tea plants. Transcripts coding enzymes involved
  in the flavonoid pathway were identified by screening the Camellia sinensis RNA-sequence
  libraries and NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Black, gray, and white
  squares enveloping the gene No. represents transcript level are high (FPKM > 100),
  medium (100 > FPKM > 10), and low (FPKM < 10), respectively. Gradient color square,
  from yellow to red, on the data of Log2Red/CK representing an increasing gene expression
  level from 0 to > 3 fold in the purple-leaf mutants was compared with the wild-type
  green tea plant.
