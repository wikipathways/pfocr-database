caption: Acetaminophen (APAP) metabolic pathway. APAP is metabolized in the hepatocyte
  through three different pathways. 2% is excreted through the urine unchanged, 85–90%
  is converted in glucuronidated and sulfated non-toxic metabolites and 10% is oxidized
  by cytochrome CYP2E1 generating the highly reactive and toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone
  imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is then conjugated with gluthatione (GSH) resulting in non-toxic
  metabolites. During APAP overdose or susceptible in patients, as the ones with chronic
  liver disease, glucuronidation and sulfation pathways become saturated and more
  APAP is metabolized through CYP2E1 which increases NAPQI generation depleting GSH
  liver stores. Free unconjugated NAPQI reacts with proteins generating NAPQI-protein
  adducts in hepatocytes leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death.
