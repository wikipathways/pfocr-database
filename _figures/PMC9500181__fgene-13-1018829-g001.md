caption: 'Mechanisms of how ferroptosis occurs and how it is inhibited in pancreatic
  islet cells. System Xc- is a cystine/glutamate antiporter system consisting of SLC7A11
  and SLC3A2. After cystine enters the cell, it is reduced to cysteine, which becomes
  the raw material for the synthesis of GSH, and GSH becomes the reducing cofactor
  of GPX4. Glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and GSH synthase (GS) are the rate-limiting
  enzymes in the GSH biosynthesis pathway. DHODH is involved in the regulation of
  ferroptosis independent of GSH pathway. FSP1 reduces CoQ through NAD(P)H, thereby
  reducing lipid free radicals and thereby inhibiting ferroptosis. Iron ions entering
  the cells undergo the Fenton reaction, which causes the peroxidation of PUFAs to
  generate lipid peroxides, resulting in the destruction of the cell membrane structure
  and the occurrence of ferroptosis. This peroxidation is regulated by three synthetases:
  ACSL4, LPCAT3, and LOX. Transferrin imports iron from the extracellular environment
  to the intracellular state through TfR1 recognition, and excess iron is stored in
  the form of bound ferritin and transported to cells under the action of FPN1. Transferrin
  imports Fe3+ (yellow ball) from the extracellular environment to the cytoplasm of
  islet β-cell through TfR1 recognition, and then Fe3+ is converted to Fe2+ (light
  green ball). The excess iron is stored in the form of bound ferritin and finally
  effluxed by FPN. Activation of p53 severely reduced the protein level of SLC7A11
  and thus mediated ferroptosis. When the organism is under oxidative stress, Nrf2
  dissociates from Keap1 and interacts with the ARE of target genes to maintain cellular
  redox homeostasis. The Nrf2-HO-1 pathway can modulate intracellular iron concentration
  to suppress ferroptosis. Nrf2 inhibits ferroptosis directly through the PPARγ pathway.
