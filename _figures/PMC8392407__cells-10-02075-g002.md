caption: Schematic representation of the functional interaction between the IGF system
  and the Hippo pathway in cancer. IGF1R might contribute to regulating the Hippo
  pathway favoring YAP expression and translocation into the nucleus. The IGF1/IGF1R/FAK/Akt/YAP
  signaling cascade, which promotes YAP nuclear accumulation and expression of its
  canonical targets, including Cyr61, is depicted. Conversely, the IGF1R inhibits
  MST1 expression and the downstream kinase LATS1/2 thereby blocking LATS1/2-driven
  YAP phosphorylation and degradation. Cyr61 drives mRNA expression of IGF1 and IGF1R
  but the mechanisms are still poorly defined. Biological responses evoked by the
  IGF/Hippo pathway in cancer are reported.
