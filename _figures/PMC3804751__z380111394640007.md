caption: Model showing the cRAF-dependent modulation of DC responses by TcES. Helminth
  parasites release excreted/secreted products that can alter immune responses. TcES
  are recognized by mannose receptor, MGL, and TLR2. Receptors act in conjunction
  to mediate TcES signaling. Signaling could be initiated by RAS, a molecule found
  in the cytoplasm of TcES-treated DCs. Ultimately, TcES signaling results in the
  phosphorylation of cRAF. cRAF-mediated signaling is able to inhibit the maturation
  of DCs and subsequent cytokine release induced by TLR4. In addition, TcES down-regulates
  the p38 and NFκB pathway, possibly in a cRAF-dependent manner. On the other hand,
  TLR4 signaling attenuates cRAF phosphorylation and Th2 response induced by TcES,
  indicating a cross regulation between both pathways. Finally, cRAF activation conditions
  DCs to induce Th2 responses, via a mechanism that is incompletely understood.

  description: Model showing the cRAF-dependent modulation of DC responses by TcES.
    Helminth parasites release excreted/secreted products that can alter immune responses.
    TcES are recognized by mannose receptor, MGL, and TLR2. Receptors act in conjunction
    to mediate TcES signaling. Signaling could be initiated by RAS, a molecule found
    in the cytoplasm of TcES-treated DCs. Ultimately, TcES signaling results in the
    phosphorylation of cRAF. cRAF-mediated signaling is able to inhibit the maturation
    of DCs and subsequent cytokine release induced by TLR4. In addition, TcES down-regulates
    the p38 and NFκB pathway, possibly in a cRAF-dependent manner. On the other hand,
    TLR4 signaling attenuates cRAF phosphorylation and Th2 response induced by TcES,
    indicating a cross regulation between both pathways. Finally, cRAF activation
    conditions DCs to induce Th2 responses, via a mechanism that is incompletely understood.
