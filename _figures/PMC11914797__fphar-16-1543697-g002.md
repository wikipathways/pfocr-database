caption: BBR and its derivatives influence the mechanism of apoptosis. They impact
  the regulation of apoptosis by reducing Cyt c release, inhibiting caspase-3 expression,
  and modulating the activation of the JNK pathway, sharp arrows (→) indicate stimulation,
  and blunt arrows (⊥) indicate inhibition. The figure was drawn using Figdraw
