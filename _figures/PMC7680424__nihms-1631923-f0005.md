caption: Two alternative pathways may exist for Cu delivery to COX and IMS-SOD1. Pathway
  A depicts the matrix storage pathway where Cu that was recruited to the matrix by
  SLC25A3 for storage is transported back to the IMS by an unidentified transporter
  for enzyme maturation. The existence of this pathway is supported by multiple studies
  under Cu stress. Pathway B depicts the direct access pathway where chaperones bind
  Cu as it enters the IMS or access it after storage in this compartment to support
  enzyme maturation. Storage in the IMS could be facilitated by the Cu5000 complex
  that was originally isolated from brain mitochondria.
