caption: (a) Th17 cells produce a pro‐osteoclastogenic effect. SFB influenced the
  expression of antimicrobial proteins RegIIIg participating in Th17 cell polarization;
  SFB induced Th17 cell differentiation by intestinal epithelial cells production
  of serum amyloid A that might affect DC cytokine; Th17 cell differentiation depended
  on MHCII‐dependent antigen presentation of SFB antigens by intestinal dendritic
  cells; Bacteroides fragilis prevented the differentiation of Th17 cells by polysaccharide
  A. (b) Tregs regulated the formation of osteoclast. Treg cell differentiation was
  induced by short‐chain fatty acids, leading to epigenetic changes to stabilize the
  program; Clostridium genus provided bacterial antigens and a TGF‐b‐rich environment,
  resulting in the expansion of systemic Tregs. (c). NLRs bind to bacterial peptides
  and attract receptor interaction protein (RIP2), stimulating the NF‐kB signaling
  pathway, which can induce osteoclastogenesis through chemokines and cytokines
