caption: Scheme depicting of G3BP2-mediated YAP signaling in OSS-induced inflammatory
  ECs. Under ECs exposed to OSS, G3BP2 involves in the SGs formation and mediates
  the activation of integrin-YAP signal transduction pathway, which upregulates the
  expression of proinflammatory genes, and then promotes the inflammatory response
  and endothelium permeability changes, and eventually leads to atherogenesis.
