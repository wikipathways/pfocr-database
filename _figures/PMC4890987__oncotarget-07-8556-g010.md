caption: During the aging process, FLNB, MAP2K3, CRKL, FOS and JUN play key roles
  in the MAPK signaling pathway. In addition, FYN, CDK4, LCK, FOS, and JUN are involved
  in T-cell receptor signaling pathway, and MAGED1, CRKL, ZNF274 and JUN are involved
  in neurotrophin signaling pathway. In order to overcome the cellular dysfunction
  caused by accumulated genetic mutations during the aging process, the transcription
  factor JUN can be activated by a wide variety of stress signals, including the MAPK
  signaling, T-cell receptor signaling, and neurotrophin signaling pathways. This
  results in various cellular responses, including cell cycle, cell communication,
  apoptosis, cell death, biological regulation, cell transport, and response to stimulus.
  In this figure, the light blue blocks represent the proteins involved in the indicated
  pathways, the dark green node represents the TF the dark blue blocks represent the
  TFs target genes, the light green nodes represent the miRNAs, the red nodes represent
  DNA methylation of genes, the yellow nodes represent the mutation of genes, arrows
  represent activation of proteins, and link represents interaction between these
  two proteins.
