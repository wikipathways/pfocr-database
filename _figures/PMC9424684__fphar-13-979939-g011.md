caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of Z1456467176 in the treatment of MSU
  crystal-induced acute gouty arthritis. MSU crystal stimulation promotes ATP production,
  which is released through caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. The interaction of extracellular
  ATP with P2X7R alters the structure of the protein and induces ion flow. Together
  with MSU crystals, it activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and promotes the release
  of sufficient IL-1β to trigger the gout inflammatory response. Z1456467176 inhibits
  ATP-induced channel opening and P2X7R-NLPR3-IL-1β pathway activation by remodeling
  the structure of P2X7R protein. Thus, acute gouty arthritis induced by MSU crystals
  was relieved.
