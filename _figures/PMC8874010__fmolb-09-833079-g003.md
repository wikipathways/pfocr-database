caption: CircRNAs involve in miRNA-associated gene regulatory pathway to regulate
  RCC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, chemoresistance and metabolism.
  Selected samples of circRNAs and their genomic targets are exhibited for tumour
  progression. CircRNAs in red represent up-regulated in RCC, and circRNAs in blue
  represent downregulated in RCC. Nanoparticles act as delivery vehicles for siRNAs
  and circRNA expression vectors provide a circRNA -based therapeutic strategy for
  RCC. CRISPR/cas9 -mediated knockout may be applied to RCC treatment.
