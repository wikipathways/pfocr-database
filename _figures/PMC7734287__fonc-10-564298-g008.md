caption: Potential mechanism for Forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1) induced angiogenesis and
  macrophage infiltration in colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis. We speculate that
  FOXQ1 can promote the migration of endothelial cell in tumor microenvironment (TME),
  improve microvessel morphogenesis, as well as strengthen intercellular interactions
  between tumor and epithelial cells mainly through activation of EGF/PDGF pathway.
  We also propose that FOXQ1 can promote macrophage infiltration in TME by activating
  the Twist1/CCL2 axis. Thus, the combined mechanisms of FOXQ1 described in this study
  support a dual role of FOXQ1 in promoting CRC tumorigenesis.
