caption: The regulatory network of B. subtilis biofilm formation. Several subnetworks
  are intertwined to trigger (arrows) or repress (T-bars) the expression of matrix
  genes involved in biofilm formation. A complex of four kinases (KinA, KinB, KinC,
  KinD) are activated in response to certain environmental stresses (such as temperature,
  high iron, oxygen concentration, hydrodynamic effects and food matrix composition).
  KinA and KinB are activated in response to impaired respiration in cytoplasm, KinC
  is activated via surfactin production and KinD is activated by glycerol, manganese
  and l-malic acid production. These sensor kinases initiate the activation of Spo0A
  through phosphorylation mediating the regulatory pathway for the expression of several
  matrix genes. Spo0Ã P govern an antirepressor SinI under SinR that derepresses the
  expression of matrix genes. In addition, SinR represses the regulatory gene slrR.
  SlrR binds to SinR and forms a heterodimeric complex, which leads to the transcription
  of the epsA-O and tapA-SipW-tasA operons, resulting in biofilm formation. Similar
  to SinI, the slrA gene is a paralogous antirepressor for SinR and is repressed by
  YwcC. Another subnetwork DegU on phosphorylation trigger the transcription of bslA
  indirectly, which encodes the BslA protein that construct hydrophobic coat over
  the biofilm. DegU trigger the activation of pgs operon directly that encodes enzymes
  that catalyze the synthesis of γ-PGA, which enhances biofilm robustness, for more
  detail see Ref. [].
