caption: 'A model for the specific desensitization of GCB by S1P. The five putative
  receptors for S1P include three (S1P1, S1P2, S1P3) that are expressed in fibroblasts.
  The desensitization of GCB by S1P is insensitive to pertussis toxin, apparently
  eliminating Giα as a component of the desensitization pathway. Given that S1P1 has
  been suggested to signal through Gi, this receptor would then be eliminated as an
  element within the GCB desensitization pathway. This suggests that either the S1P2
  or S1P3 receptor, or both, mediate S1P-specific desensitization of GCB. Abbreviations:
