caption: 'Apoptosis pathways: The extrinsic or death receptor pathway (left) is triggered
  by members of the death receptor superfamily such as Fas. Binding of Fas-L to Fas
  induces trimerization of the receptor, recruitment of specific adaptor proteins
  (FADD) and consequently recruitment of procaspase 8 molecules. The multi-molecular
  complex (DISC) results in the activation of caspase-8, which can be blocked by c-FLIP.
  Active caspase-8 can in turn activate Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of Bcl-2 family
  proteins, which represents a crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.
  Oxidants, toxicants, drugs or ionizing radiation, which all induce ROS overproduction
  and the stress signalling, can activate the intrinsic pathway (right). The intrinsic
  or mitochondrial pathway is also triggered by DNA damage via p53 activities. The
  death stimuli result in loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and release of
  cythocrome c, Apaf-1 and other pro-apoptotic factors in the cytoplasm. Maintenance
  or perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential depends on the ratio between
  pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) members of Bcl-2 family, by causing
  or preventing cythocrome c release. Multiple molecules of cythocrome c, Apaf-1,
  dATP and procaspase-9 associate to form a supramolecular complex termed ‘apoptosome’,
  that activates caspase-9 through autocatalysis. Both the activated caspase-9 and
  caspase-8 cleave procaspase-3 generating the active caspase-3 that, in turn, activates
  other executor caspases and cleaves cellular targets. Caspase activity is controlled
  by Inhibitors of Apoptosis Protein (IAPs) family.'
