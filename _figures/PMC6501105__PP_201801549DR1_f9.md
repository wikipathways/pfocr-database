caption: Model for the metabolic response to deficiency in the PPSB. In control (wild-type
  [WT]) plants, the photosynthetic cells in the AP represent the main site of Ser
  biosynthesis and sulfate assimilation, although Ser produced by the PPSB in heterotrophic
  tissue (or in photosynthetic tissues at night) would also contribute to local GSH
  biosynthesis. In the PPSB-deficient plants, local GSH deficiency in heterotrophic
  tissues stimulates sulfur assimilation in photosynthetic cells, as well as transport
  of both Ser and GSH to heterotrophic tissues. In these heterotrophic cells GSH is
  degraded by the γ-glutamyl (γ-EC) cycle to fulfill the requirements of organic bound
  reduced sulfur.
