caption: Carotenoid and directly-related biosynthesis pathways. Enzymatic conversions
  are shown by arrows with the enzymes involved in each reaction. The carotenoid pathway
  is in the center of the figure enclosed in grey, flanked by the chlorophyll and
  gibberellin (GA) pathways. Genes analyzed in this work are underlined. The non-mevalonate
  pathway (MEP) takes place in plastids to produce geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP)
  that is required for carotenoid, chlorophyll and gibberellin synthesis, among others.
