caption: Overview of the cGAS-STING pathway in cancer cells and surrounding cells.
  Pro-tumorigenic TME in cancer from chronical inflammation by the cGAS-STING pathway
  in cancer cells and normal cells surrounding them. Genome instability and damaged
  mitochondria in cancer cells produce cytosolic dsDNA, which activates the cGAS DNA
  sensor. cGAS turns ATP and GTP to cGAMP, which activates STING on the ER membrane.
  The activated STING translocates to Golgi and recruits TBK1, which phosphorylates
  IRF3. The phosphorylated IRF3 promotes the expression of inflammatory factors, which
  results in the inflammatory environment. The inflammatory factors also activate
  oncogenes in normal cells surrounding the cancer cells, which triggers the cGAS-STING
  pathway in the normal cells. The chain reaction of inflammation creates the pro-tumorigenic
  TME in cancer.
