caption: This figure provides an integrated overview of the regulatory mechanisms
  by which PIPns influence the cytoskeleton, including the dynamics of microfilaments,
  IFs, and microtubules. It highlights the complex interactions between PIPns, various
  effector proteins, and signaling pathways essential for cytoskeletal regulation,
  supporting critical cellular structures and processes such as FA, cell junction,
  proliferation, motility, migration, and invasion. This diagram is generated using
  BioRender
