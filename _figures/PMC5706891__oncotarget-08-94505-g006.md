caption: PARP1 is essential for DNA repair through the BER pathway. PARP inhibition
  by olaparib results in the formation of DSBs. In HR-proficient cells, these DSBs
  would be repaired by the error-free HR repair pathway, resulting in cell survival.
  However, in cells in which HR is defective, DSBs can be repaired by a more error-prone
  NHEJ pathway, leading to cell death. RNF144A promotes PARP1 ubiquitination and degradation,
  resulting in the absence of the drug target for PARP inhibitor olaparib and therefore
  decreased cellular sensitivity to olaparib. In addition, RNF144A could decrease
  PARP inhibitor sensitivity through promoting the proteasomal degradation of DNA-PK,
  which is a major contributor to the cytotoxicity observed in HR-deficient cells
  treated with PARP inhibitors. BER, base excision repair; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein
  kinase; DSB, double-strand break; HR, homologous recombination; NHEJ, non-homologous
  end-joining; PARP1, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1.
