caption: Schematic description of the MSR. During the MSR, microbes- and virus-associated
  molecular patterns (e.g., LPS) are sensed directly or indirectly by different receptors,
  such as Toll-like-receptors (TLRs), Rig I-like receptors (RLRs) or the dsRNA-sensing
  kinase (PKR), which through complex signalling cascades, involving the TRIF adaptor
  and different TRAF ubiquitin ligase, leads to the nuclear translocation of NFkB
  or IRF-3, and subsequent IFN-I and inflammatory cytokines transcription. Microbial
  detection leads also to GADD34 expression, which, however, in this context has little
  effect on controlling global translation, while participates in the regulation of
  cytokine production both at the translational and transcriptional level. During
  the MSR, XBP1 splicing levels varies greatly according to cell models and microbe
  stimulus used; however, a striking distinctive feature of this pathway is the translational
  inhibition of CHOP synthesis, together with enhanced level of eIF2α de-phosphorylation,
  GADD34 and expression. GADD34, ATF4 and XBP1 are likely to favour the expression
  of cytokines through the targeting of yet undefined partners at the translational,
  signal transduction and transcriptional level. Cross-talks between the UPR and MSR
  clearly exist, and the direct activation of the TRAF2 or RIDD pathway by IRE1 and
  subsequent inflammatory cytokines transcription could be an example of those commonalities.
