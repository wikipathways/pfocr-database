caption: Incubation of 14C-labeled factor IV [biosynthesized from a  mixture of 3-epi
  and 8-epi factor II (2a) with Pr.  shermanii extracts] affords cobyrinic acid (5,  isolated
  as cobester; A = CH2CO2Me; P =  CH2CH2CO2Me) in 0.6% radiochemical  yield [Fig.
  , (4) → (5)]. Epimerization at  C-8 of factor II has obviously caused derailment,
  thereby allowing  isolation of 8β-configured factor IV, which is partially reepimerized  to
  the natural (3α, 8α) isomer to allow synthesis of  (5), confirmed by conversion
  of a mixture of 3-epi and 8-epi  factor II (2a) directly to cobyrinic acid (5) in  a
  comparable 1.7% radiochemical yield, together with a substantial  amount of 8-epi
  factor IV. Indirect evidence for inversion of  stereochemistry at C-8 had previously
  been observed by the exchange of  H for D at C-3, C-8, and C-13 when vitamin B12
  was isolated  from Pr. shermanii cells grown in 50%  2H2O (). Factor IV, whose absolute  stereochemistry
  at C-2, C-7, and C-17 follows from bioconversion to  cobyrinic acid, has been oxidized
  during isolation, and like factor II  must be reduced by enzyme(s) present in the
  cell-free extract (, , )  to the precorrin-4 oxidation level (Scheme ) and then  epimerized
  at C-8 to allow incorporation to proceed. It should be noted  that precorrin-2 and
  -3 were first isolated in their oxidized forms,  factors II and III, respectively,
  and are reduced back to the  corresponding precorrins by reductive enzyme(s) present
  in the  cell-free extracts of Pr. shermanii and thus reenter the  biosynthetic pathway
  ().
