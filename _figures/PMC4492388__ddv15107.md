caption: FGF8 positively regulates ΔNp63α protein stability in mice embryonic limb
  buds. FGF8, c-Abl and p300 are component of a regulatory pathway that leads to ΔNp63α
  stabilization and transcriptional activation in embryonic limb buds. Exposure of
  AER cells to FGF8 induces a signaling intracellular cascade that activates c-Abl
  causing ΔNp63α phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. This phosphorylation event
  is indispensable for the interaction of ΔNp63α with the p300 acetyl-transferases;
  acetylation of ΔNp63α result in its stabilization and transcriptional activation.
  In the absence of FGF8, or in the presence of p63 mutations, like the SHFM-associated
  K193E mutation, this signaling pathway is not active leading to improper expression
  of genes involved in limb development. This pathway could be relevant for correct
  AER stratification (in the scheme marked in yellow) ensuring correct limb outgrowth.
papertitle: FGF8, c-Abl and p300 participate in a pathway that controls stability
  and function of the ΔNp63α protein.
