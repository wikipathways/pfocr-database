caption: Nicotinamide (NAM) and Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism.
  One source of NAM is the diet, via intake of eggs, meat, fish, and mushrooms. After
  ingestion, NAM is readily absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and widely distributed
  in the body tissues. NAM is the precursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
  that is an essential co-enzyme of redox reactions for adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  production and for several metabolic processes. NAM is converted to NAD+ through
  the salvage pathway that represents the major route of NAD+ biosynthesis in mammals.
  NAM phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes
  the first step in the biosynthesis of NAM mononucleotide (NMN) from NAM. Subsequently,
  the NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) utilize ATP for the generation of NAD+. This
  coenzyme may be directly converted from NADP+ by NAD kinase (NADK). NMN can be also
  synthetized by nicotinic acid (NA) and NAM riboside (NR). Since NAD+ acts as substrate
  for specific NAD+-consuming enzymes, NAM is also generated as by-product by these
  reactions and recycled in the salvage pathway. Specifically, the cyclic ADP-ribose
  synthases (cADPRSs) hydrolyze NAD+ to NAM. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs),
  use NAD+ as a co-substrate to PARylate target proteins (Subs), generating NAM. The
  deacetylation of specific substrates (Subs) by Sirtuins (SIRTs), which are NAD+
  dependent enzymes, generates NAM. NAM is removed from recycling by degradation that
  thus indirectly affects NAD+ levels. NAM is methylated to 1-methyl-NAM (MNA) by
  NAM-N-methyltransferase (NNMT) and then oxidized to l-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide
  (2-Pyr) and l-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide (4-Pyr).
