caption: a, The structure of S. pombe centromeric repeat regions, highlighting the
  presence of non-coding centromeric transcripts (cenRNA) and association with histone
  H3 that is dimethylated and trimethylated on lysine 9 (red lollipops) as opposed
  to histone H3 that is methylated on lysine 4 (green lollipops) in euchromatic regions.
  b, The nascent transcript model for heterochromatin assembly. The RITS is tethered
  to chromatin through base-paring interactions between siRNAs and nascent non-coding
  transcripts and interactions with H3K9-methylated nucleosomes, resulting in the
  recruitment of RDRC–Dicer, dsRNA synthesis and siRNA amplification. This RNAi positive-feedback
  loop then recruits the CLRC H3K9 methyltransferase. Efficient silencing also requires
  two HP1 proteins (Swi6 and Chp2), which promote the association of RITS with the
  non-coding RNA or mediate TGS through recruitment of the SHREC2 deacetylase complex,
  respectively. Another tier of regulation, involving the degradation of heterochromatic
  transcripts by the TRAMP/exosome pathway, further ensures full gene silencing. Blue
  arrows (bottom) highlight convergent transcription resulting in synthesis of sense
  and antisense RNAs, which may contribute to the production of trigger siRNAs.
