caption: Proposed metabolic pathway of triheptanoin (triheptanoylglycerol). Ultimately
  two acetyl-CoAs and one succinyl-CoA are expected to be the anaplerotic contribution
  of the drug to the TCA cycle. Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle to form citrate but
  has other functions including ketone body formation and used in protein acetylation
  for modulating enzyme activity (MEA), and lipid synthesis. Succinyl-CoA is a TCA
  cycle intermediate and other crucial functions including protein succinylation for
  MEA (box inset lists examples of enzymes modulated by succinylation/Sirtuin 5 desuccinylation),
  generating one GTP per cycle, and porphyrin synthesis
