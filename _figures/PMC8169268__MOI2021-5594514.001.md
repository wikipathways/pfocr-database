caption: Schematic overview of the regulation of glucose metabolism by the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway. The PI3K pathway is initiated when a growth factor like HER-2 binds its
  receptor. PI3K then catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol biphosphatase
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol triphosphatase (PIP3). PIP3 recruits and activates
  Akt. Thereafter, phosphorylated Akt stimulates mTOR. In the cell, Akt stimulates
  HK; as a consequence, glucose and [18F]FDG are phosphorylated at a higher rate.
  mTOR has an effect on the glucose metabolism through upregulation of the expression
  of GLUT1. Trastuzumab is an anti-HER-2 humanized monoclonal antibody. PIK90 is a
  PI3K inhibitor and everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor.
