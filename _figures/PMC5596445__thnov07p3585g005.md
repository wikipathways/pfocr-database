caption: 'Tailoring cancer immunotherapeutics based on tumor microenvironment immune
  types (TMITs). The tumor microenvironment has been categorized into four different
  types based on the expression of PD-L1, and CD8A/CYT: type I (adaptive immune resistance),
  type II (immunologic ignorance), type III (oncogenic pathway activation), and type
  IV (immunologic tolerance). The proposed four TMITs are simplistic, but can help
  us to tailor the most suitable immunotherapeutic strategies. APC, antigen presenting
  cell; CTL, cytotoxic lymphocyte; IFN, interferon; M2, M2 macrophage; MDSC, myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell; Th1, T helper 1; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
