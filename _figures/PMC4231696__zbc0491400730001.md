caption: Multiple routes toward synthesis of menaquinone in bacteria. The traditional
  route of menaquinone biosynthesis has been extensively characterized in E. coli
  and involves seven Men family enzymes (upper). The futalosine route diverges in
  the first two steps as indicated by blue and red coloring for routes described in
  Streptomyces coelicolor/Thermus thermophilus and C. jejuni/H. pylori, respectively.
  Menaquinone biosynthesis in C. trachomatis (CT) is predicted to function with the
  genes for each step indicated (lower; numbered boxes). The yellow-boxed reaction
  represents the reaction catalyzed by CT263 studied herein. The gray-boxed genes
  represent ubi/men homologs with predicted prenylation (CT219), methylation (CT428),
  and decarboxylation activity (CT085 and CT220) that could function in the final
  steps of menaquinone synthesis.
