caption: ZIP-mediated signaling pathways promote cell proliferation and metastasis
  in luminal and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. (a) ZIP6/ZIP10-mediated
  signaling pathway in luminal breast cancer cells. ZIP6, whose gene expression is
  induced by STAT3, is expressed on the ER membrane. On cleavage of its N-terminal
  domain, ZIP6 translocates to the plasma membrane. ZIP10 may undergo the same posttranslational
  processing leading to plasma membrane localization. On the plasma membrane, ZIP6
  and ZIP10 exist as homo- and heteromers. Zinc uptake via ZIP6 and/or ZIP10 results
  in the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) by phosphorylation either
  directly or indirectly by activation (phosphorylation) of Akt. Inactive GSK3β is
  unable to phosphorylate the transcription factor Snail, resulting in nuclear retention
  of Snail. Snail represses transcription of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin, leading
  to cell migration and metastasis. (b) ZIP7-mediated signaling pathway in tamoxifen-resistant
  breast cancer cells. The signaling pathway involves stimulation of the EGFR, a receptor
  tyrosine kinase that responds to binding of the extracellular ligand by dimerization,
  trans-phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activation. EGFR is also transactivated
  by the protein tyrosine kinase Src, and this transactivation is stimulated by zinc.
  It is unclear where the zinc that stimulates Src activates originates, but it may
  involve a plasma membrane ZIP transporter. EGFR activation results in phosphorylation
  of ZIP7 by the serine/threonine protein kinase CK2, although it is unclear how the
  signal is transduced from EGFR to CK2. Phosphorylated ZIP7 transports zinc from
  the Golgi or ER into the cytoplasm. The increased cytoplasmic zinc inhibits protein
  tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), causing sustained activation of EGFR and Src. In addition,
  the released zinc activates kinases ERK1, ERK2 and Akt, which regulate signaling
  pathways leading to cancer cell proliferation and migration.
