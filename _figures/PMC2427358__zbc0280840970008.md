caption: Summary of GRTH impact in apoptotic pathways in germ cells. GRTH  regulates
  subsets of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors involved in  mitochondria, death
  receptor, and NF-κB signaling pathways in germ cells  apoptosis. Left, GRTH acts
  as a negative regulator to prevent  antiapoptotic factor expression (×) during spermatogenesis.
  Absence of  GRTH caused increased expression of anti-apoptotic factors (solid  oval)
  and suppression of pro-apoptotic factors (stippled oval)  in the mitochondria controlled
  apoptotic pathway with subsequent cytochrome  c release, and downstream caspase
  3/9 activation (middle).  Regarding the TNFα/TNF-R1 signaling pathway, the lack
  of GRTH increased  the TNF-R1-associated adaptor protein TRADD expression could
  cause the  downstream caspase 8 activation (solid oval). Other cytoplasmic  adaptor
  proteins are not apparently involved in the GRTH regulatory action  (open oval).
  Right, NF-κB pathway. GRTH could  have impact in NF-κB action at both cytoplasmic
  and nuclear levels. In  the cytoplasm, lack of GRTH (–) caused the decrease in IKKα/β  kinase
  complex expression and IκB phosphorylation; consequently its  proteasomal-dependent
  degradation is curtailed. This favors nonphosphorylate  IκBα/β association with
  NF-κB, which reduces its import  to the nucleus and presumably the transcriptional
  activation of anti-apoptotic  genes. Lack of GRTH could also alter the acetylation
  status of NF-κB in  the nucleus by increases in HDAC and decreases in acetylase
  p300 expression,  resulting in the decrease in anti-apoptotic gene transcription
  and apoptosis.  Presence of GRTH (+) promotes cell survival. P, phosphorylation.
