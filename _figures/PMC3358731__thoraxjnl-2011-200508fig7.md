caption: Targeting the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) pathway leads
  to attenuation of wound repair via different mechanisms. Urokinase plasminogen activator
  (uPA) binding to uPAR activates both extracellular and intracellular signalling
  cascades. (A) Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) binding to uPAR and its
  co-receptors interferes with signalling via multiple mechanisms. Damage to the epithelial
  layer leads to increased soluble uPAR (suPAR) and phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and
  p38. (B) Blocking the interaction between uPA and uPAR at the time of damage leads
  to decreased suPAR, uPA and PAI-1 in the supernatant, changes in activation of signalling
  pathways and attenuation of wound repair. (C) Increased levels of uPAR lead to increased
  receptor shedding, changes in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) activity and attenuation
  of wound repair. Soluble uPAR sequesters uPA and prevents it binding to cell surface
  uPAR.
