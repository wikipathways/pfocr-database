caption: Schematic diagram of the purinergic signaling complex. Once released into
  the extracellular environment, through channels or other extrusion systems, ATP
  exerts its extracellular effects by binding P2 receptors (P2X and P2Y). ATP is degraded
  by the nucleotidases CD39 and CD73, leading to the sequential dephosphorylation
  of ATP to ADP and AMP and subsequent generation of the bioactive metabolite adenosine,
  which activates P1 (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) receptors. The CD38-CD203a (ectonucleotide
  pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 3) enzyme axis on the cell surface, operating
  independently or in synergy with the conventional CD39/CD73 pathway, also contributes
  to the generation of the adenosine. Several cell types are endowed with nucleoside
  transporters (NT) and adenosine deaminase, which mediate the uptake or deamination
  of extracellular adenosine, respectively, thus actively participating in the termination
  of adenosine signaling. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ADPR, ADP-ribose; AMP, adenosine
  monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.
