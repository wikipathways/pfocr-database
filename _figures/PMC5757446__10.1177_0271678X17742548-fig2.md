caption: 'Current and proposed molecular mechanisms augmenting myogenic reactivity
  in subarachnoid hemorrhage. A mechanosensitive complex localized to the plasma membrane
  initiates the myogenic response, resulting in membrane potential depolarization,
  calcium entry and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation.
  ERK1/2 phosphorylates sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), eliciting its translocation
  to the plasma membrane and synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) from sphingosine.
  Intracellular S1P modulates pressure-stimulated calcium elevation, which activates
  calmodulin (CAM), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) and the contraction apparatus.
  Extracellular S1P activates the S1P2 receptor subtype (S1P2R) to activate the RhoA/Rho
  kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway, which inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP).
  Inhibiting MLCP enhances MLCK''s activation of the contractile apparatus. Extracellular
  S1P is sequestered from S1P2R by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
  (CFTR), which transports S1P across the plasma membrane for dephosphorylation by
  S1P phosphohydrolase 1 (SPP1). In subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the induction of
  inflammatory tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling curtails CFTR gene expression
  (not shown) and accelerates CFTR degradation mechanisms: this results in higher
  S1P bioavailability for S1P2R signaling and increases activation of the contractile
  apparatus. In experimental settings, preventing TNF signaling (etanercept; ETN)
  or antagonizing S1P2R signaling (JTE013) successfully blocks this pathological process.
  Therapeutics that increases CFTR expression (Lumacaftor) or activity (Ivacaftor)
  would be expected to have similar efficacy in terms of blocking the pathological
  enhancement of S1P/S1P2R signaling: their value as a therapeutic intervention awaits
  experimental validation.'
