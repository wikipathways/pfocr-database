caption: The role of COP1 in the GA signaling pathway. In the dark, high GA levels
  lead to a reduction of DELLA relieving the suppression of PIFs activity and promoting
  the expression of genes involved in skotomorphogenesis. At the same time, COP1 can
  reduce the accumulation of HY5 protein in the nucleus and prevent the expression
  of photomorphogenesis genes. In the light, confinement of COP1 to the cytoplasm
  induces accumulation of HY5 and a reduction in the GA levels. The decrease in GA
  content will also reduce the suppression of DELLA resulting in increased PIFs activity.
