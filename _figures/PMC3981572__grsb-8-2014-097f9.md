caption: 'Integrative model of the physiogenomic adaptations in adipose and liver
  tissue induced by energy overfeeding during the last 45 days of pregnancy. PPAR
  co-regulator expression prepartum suggests the existence of a “priming” effect such
  that after parturition the marked increase in blood non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA)
  represent a signal for induction of fatty acid oxidation, synthesis of hepatokines,
  and reduction of lipogenic intermediates that could inhibit oxidation (e.g. malonyl-CoA).
  The greater insulin concentration induced by overfeeding energy prepartum likely
  accounts for the up-regulation of the transcription regulator SREBF1. The postpartal
  uncoupling of the GH/IGF-1 axis appears to be partly a response of the marked increase
  in local FGF21 synthesis and activation of SOCS2 signalling to inhibit GH action
  and synthesis of IGF-1.Notes: The different shades of color for genes and metabolites
  are indicative of the relative changes induced by overfeeding energy compared with
  the control. Yellow to red denote modest increase/up-regulation to marked increase/up-regulation;
  gray to dark green denote no change to marked decrease/down-regulation. Positive
  or negative signs denote activation or inhibition. Dotted lines denote a likely
  effector function on a particular gene or pathway.'
