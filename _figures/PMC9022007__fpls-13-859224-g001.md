caption: Schematic diagram of plant salt-stress sensors and signal transduction pathways
  involved in salt stress responses. High salt stress causes osmotic stress and ionic
  stress, both of which lead to the accumulation of ROS, triggering oxidative stress.
  (1) High concentrations of salt ions alter the concentration of ions in the cell
  wall, which are sensed by specific sensors or receptors (such as RLKs, GIPC, and
  FER), which activate signaling pathways such as the SOS pathway to redistribute
  ions and achieve ion homeostasis. (2) Changes in the balance between ion concentrations
  inside and outside the cell change the cell’s osmotic potential. The cell senses
  these changes through specific sensors (such as HPKs, NSCCs, and BON) and, through
  MAPK cascades (such as the HOG pathway), regulates the synthesis of organic osmolytes
  (such as proline and betaine) and the absorption of ions to achieve osmotic homeostasis.
  (3) The accumulation of ROS generated by plasma membrane–bound NADPH oxidase under
  salinity leads to secondary oxidative stress. Transcription factors such as CBF/DREB
  regulate the synthesis of some stress proteins (such as RD29A) to deal with the
  damage caused by secondary metabolites and achieve ROS homeostasis. Finally, salt
  tolerance is achieved through the synergy of various signaling pathways and the
  expression of salt tolerance–related genes. ROS, reactive oxygen species; RLKs,
  receptor-like protein kinases; GIPC, glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramide; FER,
  FERONIA; HPKs, histidine protein kinases; NSCCs, non-selective cation channels;
  BON, BONZAI1; SOS pathway, Salt Overly Sensitive pathway; MAPK cascades, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase cascades; HOG pathway, high-osmolarity glycerol pathway; NADPH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphaten; CBF, CRT/DRE-binding factor; DREB, dehydration
  responsive element binding protein; ANN1, ANNEXIN1; CNGC, cyclic nucleotide-gated
  channel; GORK, Guard Cell Outward-Rectifying Potassium Channel; NHX, Na+/H+ exchanger.
