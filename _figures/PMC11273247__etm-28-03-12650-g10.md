caption: Sodium sulphate ameliorates hypercholesterolemia and hepatic insulin resistance
  in mice fed an HCD. Sodium sulphate inhibits the highly expressed TRB3 in the hepatocytes
  of mice fed an HCD, to attenuate the hepatic insulin resistance of these mice. In
  the enterocytes of the ileum, FGF15 expression is downregulated following the administration
  of sodium sulphate to mice fed an HCD. In addition, the hepatic expression of KLB,
  which is the co-receptor of FGFR4 for FGF15 binding, is significantly downregulated
  by sodium sulphate, and reduces the activation of JNK, which is downstream of the
  FGF15/FGFR4-KLB signaling pathway. The activation of c-Jun, which is the major target
  of p-JNK, is notably reduced, and the expression of Cyp7a1, which is inhibited by
  p-c-Jun, is significantly increased, which enhances the conversion of cholesterols
  to bile acids in these mice. HCD, high cholesterol diet; TRB3, tribbles homolog
  3; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; FGFR, FGF receptor; KLB, Klotho β; JNK, c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase; p-, phosphorylated; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; PDK1,
  3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1; FXR, farnesoid X receptor
