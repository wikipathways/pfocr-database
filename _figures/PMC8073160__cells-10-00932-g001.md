caption: 'Bone remodeling regulation can be paracrine or endocrine. Several factors
  participate in paracrine regulation including cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha,
  IL-4 and interferon-gamma), PGE2, VEGF, and hypoxia, as well as bone cells. There
  are three main cell types involved: osteoblasts, osteocytes and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts,
  which differentiate from mesenchymal progenitors thanks to certain proteins (Runx2,
  Osx and Wnt) and FGF signaling pathways, are responsible for bone formation. They
  can also become osteocytes able to regulate osteoblastogenesis through production
  of inhibitors (DKK-1 and SOST), that inhibit Wnt signaling. Lastly, osteoclasts,
  involved in bone resorption are activated through RANK-RANKL-OPG signaling pathway
  cross-talk. Whenever there is a need for bone resorption, osteoblasts and osteocytes
  express RANKL on their surface, and this then binds to RANK in osteoclast precursors,
  activating their differentiation. OPG is then secreted to stop bone resorption binding
  to RANKL blocking the possibility of RANK-RANKL binding and preventing bone resorption.
  Once activated, mature osteoclasts bind to the bone matrix, becoming polarized.
  Their cytoskeleton organizes into actin rings forming the sealing zone, which provides
  an isolated acidic microenvironment, to dissolve minerals and digest the selected
  bone matrix thanks to the ruffle border (RB). After resorption, the osteoclasts
  endocytose the degraded collagen fragments, and the calcium and phosphate released
  are then transported through the cell and liberated at the functional secretory
  domain before being released into the bloodstream. Bone formation and resorption
  are also influenced by endocrine regulation. Various factors may be involved, for
  example, PTH, 1,25(OH) Vitamin D, calcitonin and thyroid hormone.'
