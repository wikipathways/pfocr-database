caption: 'Full pathway results and possible mechanism for discordant variant rs77010315
  with gene annotation SLC36A2. rs77010315 (SLC36A2): the discordant variant rs77010315
  is a missense variant in SLC36A2, which encodes a transporter for small amino acids
  such as alanine (supplementary expanded pathway Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ).
  We hypothesize this variant is discordant because it increases the activity of SLC36A2,
  leading to increased transport of alanine into cells. This results in a decrease
  in levels of alanine in the blood, but results in increased intracellular conversion
  of alanine to pyruvate and glutamate. Pyruvate can then be reversibly converted
  to lactate, resulting in an increase in lactate levels, as well as converted to
  acetyl-CoA. The increased pyruvate results in an increase in glycine levels because
  less needs to be broken down to produce it. The increase in acetyl-CoA leads to
  an increase in its downstream citric acid cycle intermediates including citrate,
  fumarate, succinyl-CoA, and alpha-ketoglutarate. The increased glutamate leads to
  an increase in glutamine and the increase in fumarate leads to an increase in tyrosine
  and phenylalanine. The increase in acetyl-CoA also leads to an increase in isoleucine,
  HMG-CoA, and leucine since less needs to be broken down to produce it, and to increased
  acetoacetyl-CoA since more acetyl-CoA is available to be converted to it. Acetoacetyl-CoA
  can then be converted to acetoacetate, leading to an increase in all three ketone
  bodies (acetoacetate, acetone, and -hydroxybutyrate), as well as succinyl-CoA. Finally,
  the increased succinyl-CoA leads to an increase in valine because less valine needs
  to be broken down to produce it. This variant also had consistent associations consistent
  in direction of effect with alanine (Z = –4.3, p=2e-5), glutamine (Z = 3.9, p=1e-4),
  valine (Z = 3.7, p=2e-4), and glycine (Z = 3.4, p=8e-4) in another dataset (). In
  this dataset, the most significant association with this variant was carnitine (Z
  = 13.2, p=2e-39) (). Carnitine can be made from methionine, which is a metabolite
  that can be produced from glycine breakdown. Because increased levels of glycine
  from this variant may result in increased levels of carnitine, based on the hypothesized
  mechanism for this variant it may make sense that carnitine would have a positive
  association.'
