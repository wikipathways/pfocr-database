caption: 'The data suggest that at least two pathways are required for Txnip rescue –
  Pathway I: enhancement of lactate catabolism, which requires the function of LDHB;
  and pathway II: improved mitochondrial health, possibly through mitochondrial Parp1
  inhibition. An additional pathway, pathway III: inhibiting glycolysis by removing
  glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) from cell surface, may partially contribute to rescue
  by working with improved lactate metabolism and improved mitochondrial health, and/or
  unidentified pathways. This diagram was created from a BioRender Template. MCT:
  monocarboxylate transporter; 3PG: 3 phosphoglyceric acid; TCA: tricarboxylic acid
  cycle.'
