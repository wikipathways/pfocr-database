caption: (A) An overview of the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. (1) Receptor complexes
  at the cell surface are associated with inactive JAK dimers, which bind close to
  the transmembrane region of the receptors. (2) Binding of ligand produces a conformational
  change in the receptor complex that changes the relative position of the JAKs, leading
  to phosphorylation and activation of their tyrosine kinase activity. The activated
  JAKs phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tails of receptors. (3)
  Cytoplasmic STATs bind to the phosphorylated receptors, becoming substrates for
  JAKs. (4) Phosphorylated STATs form dimers and accumulate in the nucleus, where
  they activate transcription of specific genes. (B) Schematic structure of JAK proteins.
  The FERM domain (4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin and moesin) mediates the interaction
  with receptor complexes. The SH2 domain is a protein domain that binds to phosphorylated
  tyrosine residues. The JH2 pseudokinase domain regulates kinase activity of the
  JH1 kinase domain. P marks conserved tyrosine residues in JH1 whose phosphorylation
  is essential for JAK activation. N and C indicate the amino terminus and carboxy
  terminus. (C) Schematic structure of STAT proteins. The SH2 domain binds phosphorylated
  tyrosines. The carboxy terminus transactivation domain is required for full transcriptional
  activation. P marks the conserved tyrosine residue whose phosphorylation is essential
  for STAT activation.
