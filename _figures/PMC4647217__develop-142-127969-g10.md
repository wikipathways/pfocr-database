caption: 'Model of miR-31 regulation in PMC patterning and function. miR-31 directly
  suppresses several key components within the PMC GRN: Pmar1, Alx1, Snail and VegfR7.
  Eve activates transcription of Wnt5 in the endoderm; Wnt5 then acts as a short-range
  signaling molecule to Fzd expressed in the ectoderm. Activation of the non-canonical
  Wnt pathway in the ectoderm turns on an unidentified activator (X) that transcriptionally
  activates Pax2/5/8, leading to Vegf3 transcription. The model predicts that miR-31
  also regulates ectodermally derived PMC patterning signals, potentially through
  its regulation of activators, components and/or genes downstream of the non-canonical
  Wnt pathway. miR-31 coordinately regulates genes within the PMCs and in the ectoderm
  to ensure proper PMC patterning and function.'
