caption: Schematic model depicting the putative action of ADPN on a glial cell of
  the myenteric plexus influencing SMC ion channels. ADPN interacts with AdipoR1 located
  on enteric glial cell membrane activating the AMPK pathway. This in turn promotes
  NOS activity, which leads to NO production. NO, as a gaseous molecule, spreads to
  the nearby SMC, ultimately affecting its bioelectric properties. Particularly, K+
  channel activation results enhanced (+), whereas the Ca2+ channel activation results
  decreased (-) by ADPN. However, the modulation of Ca2+ channels may not be due only
  to NO but can involve further downstream effectors to AMPK (as indicated by the
  question mark). The blockade of AMPK by dorsomorphin and the inhibition of NO synthesis
  by L-NNA are also illustrated in the scheme.
