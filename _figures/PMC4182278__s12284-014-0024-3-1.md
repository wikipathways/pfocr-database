caption: Cold sensing and responsive pathway in rice. (A) ABA signaling is initiated
  by ABA accumulation, and is transduced by ABF and the ABRE-containing OsNAC gene,
  which regulates the expression of a NACRS-containing target gene to increase cold
  tolerance. (B) The DREB-CRT/DRE pathway is initiated by a Ca2+-influx signal that
  is transduced by calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs), OsMYB3R-2, OsMYB2, and
  OsICE1/2. The expression of OsDREB1B and OsDREB2A are down-regulated by MYBS3. (C)
  The MAPK cascade (OsMKK6-OsMPK3 and OsMPK6) is activated by ROS and is negatively
  regulated by OsTRX23. Solid arrows indicate direct activation; broken arrows indicate
  indirect activation; lines ending with a bar indicate negative regulation.
