caption: The Nitrate – Nitrite – Nitric oxide signaling pathway. Oxidation of L-Arginine
  results in production of nitric oxide (NO) and L-Citrulline. NO, in turn, can react
  with oxygen to form nitrites and nitrates. NO can be liberated from nitrites and
  nitrates through reduction catalyzed by nitrite reductase. Arginine is also a substrate
  for arginase in the urea cycle, producing a urea and L-ornithine, which in turn
  can also be converted into L-Citrulline. These reactions can be altered by drugs
  such as NOS inhibitors and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA).
