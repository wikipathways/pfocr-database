caption: Schematic illustration representing the microglial intracellular Ca2+signaling
  mediated by canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3) channels and the tripartite
  synapse. In microglia, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induces a sustained
  increase in [Ca2+]i through binding of the truncated TrkB receptors (TrkB-T), resulting
  in activation of the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Up-regulation of cell surface
  TRPC3 channels occurs after a brief treatment with BDNF and contributes to the maintenance
  of BDNF-induced sustained intracellular Ca2+ elevation. BDNF-induced elevation of
  basal levels of [Ca2+]i mediated by TRPC3 channels could be important for the BDNF-induced
  suppression of nitric oxide (NO) production induced by TNFα or IFNγ. Microglial
  intracellular Ca2+signaling is also important for microglial functions such as phagocytosis
  in the brain. The tripartite synapse consists of the presynaptic (glutamatergic)
  terminal, postsynaptic terminal, astrocytes and microglia. Dysregulation of normal
  microglial functions including incorrect synaptic pruning, failure of phagocytosis
  of apoptotic neurons and abnormal secretion of inflammatory cytokines might be underlying
  mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).
  On the other hand, the effects of proBDNF on microglial functions are not fully
  understood. Further work will be needed to elucidate the role of proBDNF on microglial
  cells by focusing on intracellular Ca2+signaling mediated by TRPC channels.
