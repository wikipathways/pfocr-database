caption: Canonical non-shivering thermogenesis. In response to cold exposure and overeating,
  norepinephrine (NE) binds to β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR), initiating adenosine cyclase-cAMP-protein
  kinase A (AC-cAMP-PKA) pathway. Subsequently the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)
  on the surface of lipid droplets is phosphorylated and the triglycerides translate
  into free-fatty-acid (FFA) after hydrolysis, which activates uncoupling protein
  1 (UCP1) that inhibited by ATP, as a substrate for the following β-oxidation in
  the mitochondrial matrix. Additionally, interorgan communication provides more available
  substrates and fuels from exogenous sources, such as glucose, oxygen, FFA, acylcarnitine,
  metabolites, which come from the circulation, WAT, liver, and gut microbiome. Figure
