caption: Chemotaxis in the squid–vibrio symbiosis. a Representative methyl-accepting
  chemotaxis protein (MCP) topology, including the ligand-binding domain, the HAMP
  domain, and methylation domain. Triangles represent potential ligands. b Simplified
  scheme of the chemotaxis signal-transduction cascade in Vibrio spp. Changes in chemoeffector
  levels are detected by the transmembrane MCP chemoreceptors. The resulting signal
  cascade starts with the SH3-like adaptor protein CheW, and passes to the CheA histidine
  kinase. In response to decreased chemoeffector concentration, the chemoreceptors
  activate CheA autophosphorylation. Phosphorylated CheA (CheA-P) phosphorylates CheY.
  CheY-P binds to the flagellar motor and promotes a switch in the direction of rotation
  from counterclockwise to clockwise. Finally, CheZ dephosphorylates CheY-P, allowing
  rapid termination of the signal response and re-setting of the pathway. In the absence
  of chemoeffector, CheA-P favors counterclockwise rotation. c Chemoeffectors secreted
  by the squid tissues establish a gradient (blue) extending out from the pores.,V.
  fischeri cells are attracted by this gradient, and migrate through the pores to
  their final site of colonization, the deep crypts
