caption: 'Reactions marked in red are the essential reactions (including transporters).
  For reactions numbered 1–15 refer  online. The three compartments, i.e. chloroplast,

  involved in the process, wherein a few of the photorespiratory reactions are also
  found to be essential. Bold purple arrow heads indicate the reactions involved when
