caption: 'The Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway in Parkinson''s disease. Under unstressed
  conditions, oxidative molecules like ROS and RNS activate the protective antioxidant
  pathway, dissociating the cytosolic Nrf2/Keap1 complex. The Nrf2 factor translocates
  to the nucleus where associated with bZip proteins trigger the expression of several
  homeostatic genes with the ARE sequence in their promoters, including SOD, HO-1,
  GST, and NQO1. Upon inactivation, Nrf2 is sequestered by Keap1 and targeted for
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Nrf2: nuclear factor (erythroid-derived
  2)-related factor 2; Keap1: Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; bZip: basic region
  leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors; SOD: superoxide dismutase; HO-1: heme
  oxygenase-1; GST: glutathione S-transferase; NQO1: NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1.'
