caption: Adenosine metabolism pathway. Activity and concentration of enzymes Adenosine
  deaminase (ADA, red) and Adenosine kinase (ADK, red) were measured. We were unable
  to measure the concentration of APRT (pink). Metabolites in orange had concentrations
  quantified, those in gray were not measured.
