caption: Dab2 modulation of Ras/MAPK pathway at the endosomal membranes, and Dab2
  function in a feedback mechanism of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTK), including EGF and TGF-beta receptors, signal through the Grb2-Sos1 complexes
  and their activation of Ras, and downstream cascade Raf, MEK, and Erk1/2 to regulate
  cell proliferation, motility, and differentiation. Grb2 interacts through its SH2
  domain binding to phosphotyrosine residue of the activated RTK, and binds via its
  SH3 domains to the proline-rich domain of Sos1 or Dab2. Phosphorylation of Sos1
  and Dab2 by Erk1/2 leads to disassociation of Sos1/2 from Grb2, which is then sequestered
  by Dab2. The disassembly of Sos1/Grb2 complexes leads to the termination of Ras
  activation, serving as a feedback regulatory loop in the control of the Ras/MAPK
  pathway. The re-arrangement of Grb2/Sos1 complex to Grb2/Dab2 association likely
  coincides with clathrin and adaptor coat disassembly. Loss of Dab2 in cancer cells
  leads to unsuppressed Ras/MAPK activation.
