caption: 'Overview of the lung TME chip operation principles. (A) A symmetric flow-based
  lung tumor lab chip includes several channels, an IL-6 pond in the center, and multiple
  areas for making different concentrations of IL-6 as well as the following: IL-6
  inlets, cell collecting outlets, RPMI inlets, RPMI outlets, cell loading outlets,
  bubble trapping areas, CCAs for long-lasting cell culture, and CCCs with U-shaped
  pillars well designed. (B) A549 and Jurkat cells were mixed with pre-GelMA. Through
  cell-loading inlets, cells mixed with hydrogels were distributed onto the chip.
  Cells were loaded into chambers with a 1 × 106 μm/min flow rate. The designed photomask
  was attached to the bottom side and UV light was irradiated for 35 s to synthesize
  GelMA’s polymer structure in CCAs. (C) After activating the IL-6 signaling pathway
  on T cells, activated T cells migrate from CCAs to ECs. However, due to the constant
  flow in biochips, migratory cells move through channels to CCCs. Supernatant and
  migrated cells were collected for 48 h from CCC outlets. The supernatant was analyzed
  for concentrations of IFNγ and TNF-α, as well as several CD markers CD4/CD8/CD69/CD183/CD196/PD1
  targeted for future analysis. (D) In this diagram, all steps of biological experiments
  are summarized'
