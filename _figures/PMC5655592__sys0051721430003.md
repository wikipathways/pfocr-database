caption: (A) The antigen presentation pathway was downregulated in the GF mice. Each
  pathway node was dually colored using the transcriptome (left) and proteome (right)
  data subsets. The immunoproteasome complex is from the protein ubiquitination pathway.
  The statistical significance data were qe (transcriptome, downregulated) = 1.0E−14,
  qe (proteome, downregulated) = 6.6E−10, qe (meta-analysis, downregulated) = 1.9E−3,
  Pc (transcriptome) = 3.4E−3, and Pc (meta-analysis) = 3.9E−2. The proteome node-level
  intraset concordancy data were not statistically significant, but they were close
  (Pc = 6.5E−2; significance level = 0.05). CALR, calreticulin; CLIP, class II-associated
  invariant chain peptide; CNX, calnexin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; TPN, tapasin. (B) The concordant[T,P] network of biological pathways formed
  two independent clusters related to the immune system (left) and metabolism (right).
  Each node depicts a significantly enriched biological pathway, and each edge depicts
  at least one instance of overlapping genes that were significantly affected by germ
  status. Pathways were classified as upregulated if the annotation enrichment was
  maximally significant by analyzing only the upregulated genes and likewise for the
  downregulated pathways. IL-4, interleukin-4.
