caption: a) BCL-2 family proteins regulate the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and
  can be divided into antiapoptotic and proapoptotic subgroups. Antiapoptotic proteins
  sequester proapoptotic proteins by binding to their BH3 motifs (blue rectangles)
  and often exhibit preferential binding to specific family members. Some BH3 proteins,
  such as BIM, can directly activate effector proteins, facilitating their insertion
  into the mitochondrial outer membrane, oligomerization, and subsequent mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). b) Antiapoptotic proteins are often overexpressed
  in cancer cells, where they sequester high levels of proapoptotic proteins to maintain
  survival. Such cells are poised to initiate apoptosis upon the release of sufficient
  quantities of proapoptotic proteins, a state referred to as “primed for death”.
  The figure at left represents a cell with primed BCL-2. Small-molecule BH3 mimetics
  such as venetoclax (green rectangles) can competitively displace proapoptotic proteins
  to trigger programmed cell death. However, other antiapoptotic proteins such as
  BCL-XL and MCL-1 can capture proapoptotic proteins liberated by venetoclax, thereby
  acting as resistance factors.
