caption: The figure shows that TLR2 activation on epithelial cells by the fungus resulted
  in the release of the Ca2+–binding protein, S100B, that paracrinally binds to RAGE,
  on polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and mediates its association with TLR2 with subsequent
  inhibition. However, S100B, upon binding to nucleic acids, also activates an intracellular
  TLR3/TLR9/TRIF–dependent pathway culminating in the transcriptional down-regulation
  of S100B. The transcriptional regulation of S100B by the sequential action of downstream
  MyD88– and TRIF–dependent NF–κB signalling pathways provides the molecular basis
  for an evolving braking circuit in infection whereby the endogenous danger protects
  the host against pathogen–induced inflammation and a nucleic acid–sensing mechanism
  resolves danger–induced chronic inflammation.
