caption: Evolutionary conservation of the DNA damage and the replication checkpoints.
  In mammalian systems, the DNA damage pathway reaches HuCds1 through ATM, but the
  DNA replication block pathway reaches HuCds1 through another kinase, possibly ATR
  (see text for details). Because the proposed role of ATR in the replication block
  pathway has not been demonstrated, it is tentatively placed in parentheses. With
  severe DNA damage, PI-3 kinases such as DNA-PK or ATR may activate HuCds1 as well
  (see text for details). Kinases containing FHA domains are indicated with large
  bold characters.
