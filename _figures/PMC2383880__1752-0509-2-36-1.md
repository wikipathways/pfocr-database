caption: Manual layout of Type II interferon signalling (IFNG) taken from the integrated
  pathway diagram (Figure 2). The pathway is arranged to flow from left to right.
  Components are coloured according to type (protein, complex or gene) and arranged
  within the sub-cellular compartments in which they are active. This pathway is initiated
  by IFNG binding to its receptor and a subsequent phosphorylation cascade involving
  a number of the JAK and STAT family of proteins. Several transcriptionally active
  complexes are formed (STAT1 homodimer, ISGF3 complex, STAT1:STAT1:IRF9 complex)
  and the pathway culminates with the transcriptional activation of target genes.
