caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism by which MBL alleviates the progression
  of RA. MBL inhibits the progression of mouse AIA via increasing the MDSCs frequency
  and decreasing T cells proliferation. Mechanistic studies established that MBL inhibited
  MDSCs apoptosis via down-regulating TNF-α/TNFR1-induced activation of FADD/caspase
  8/caspase 3 signaling pathway.
