caption: 'Diagram illustrating some of the mechanisms regulated by PAs underlying
  Ca2+ and proton balance in pollen tube growth. It is supposed that the accumulation
  of both proton and Ca2+ ions, highlighted in the apex, depends on their influx through
  specific plasma membrane channels. Ion channels are under the control of other effectors;
  specifically, Ca2+ channels are regulated by receptors and small GTPases that mediate
  external signals. Ca2+ accumulation could hypothetically activate proton channels.
  Ca2+ levels are also controlled through another signaling pathway; the GTPase-receptor
  complex can activate the plasma membrane-associated phospholipase C (PLC) [], which
  in turn generates IP3. The latter can stimulate the opening of Ca2+ channels. The
  membrane receptor system most likely also activates the production of ROS through
  NAD(P)H oxidase; in turn, ROS can affect Ca2+ flux. The action of PAs could be implemented
  in two distinct ways: PAs could activate the efflux of Ca2+ in the subapical region,
  while PAs could contribute to ROS production through the PAO enzyme, thus causing
  an increase in Ca2+ influx. The diagram also shows how the activation of PLC can
  lead to an increase in Ca2+ as mediated by IP3 production. Among the membrane phospholipases,
  phospholipase D (PLD) [] should also be recalled because it is responsible for the
  production of phosphatidic acid, a chemical mediator during stressful conditions.'
