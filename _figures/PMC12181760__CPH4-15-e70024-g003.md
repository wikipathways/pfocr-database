caption: Pathways linking gut‐derived metabolite TMAO to CVDs via endothelial, cardiac
  fibroblast and cardiomyocytes dysfunction. TMAO in endothelium inhibits the expression
  SIRT3 and the activity of SOD2, leading to the accumulation of mtROS. This oxidative
  stress activates the NLRP3 inflammasome resulting in the production of pro‐inflammatory
  cytokines IL‐1β and IL‐18, which contribute to endothelial inflammation. Elevated
  circulating TMAO levels have been associated with decreased expression of SIRT1,
  leading to increased oxidative stress, resultant excessive ROS accumulation and
  reduced SIRT1 activity TMAO upregulates VCAM‐1 expression by activating the protein
  kinase C (PKC)/NF‐κB signaling pathway. This process directly results in endothelial
  dysfunction, characterized by reduced self‐repair capacity and increased monocyte
  adhesion to the endothelium. TMAO in cardiac fibroblasts activating the TGF‐βRI/Smad2/NLRP3
  pathway and upregulation of α‐SMA and collagen I expression which leads to the conversion
  to cardiac myofibroblasts. TMAO in cardiomyocytes triggers TGF‐β1/Smad3 and p65
  NF‐κB signaling pathways and lowers energy metabolism and mitochondrial function
  by disrupting pyruvate and fatty oxidation, as well as the TCA cycle. It also adversely
  affects myocardial contractile function and intercellular calcium processing. TMAO
  also increased the expression levels of ANP and β‐MHC, which caused myocardial hypertrophy
  and fibrosis through activation of the TGF‐β1/Smad3 pathway. ANP, atrial natriuretic
  factor; IL‐18, interleukin‐18; mtROS, mitochondrial ROS; NLRP3, nucleotide‐binding
