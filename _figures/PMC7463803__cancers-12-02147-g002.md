caption: Carbon labelling TCA cycle intermediates and aspartate from U-13C glutamine
  via oxidative (carbon marked with blue) and reductive carboxylation (carbon marked
  with red) pathway. Oxidative glutaminolysis generates M+4-labeled TCA cycle intermediates
  while reductive carboxylation generates M+5 citrate followed by M+3 malate, fumarate,
  succinate and aspartate.
