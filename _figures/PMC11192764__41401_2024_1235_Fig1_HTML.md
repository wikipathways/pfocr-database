caption: a Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is synthesized as pro-TGF-β peptide
  before being cleaved to form latency associated peptide (LAP) and mature TGF-β ligand.
  The mature TGF-β is non-covalently associated with LAP, forming small latent complex
  (SLC). SLC is then linked to latent TGF-β binding protein (LTBP) to form large latency
  complex (LLC) before being secreted to the extracellular domain and deposited in
  the extracellular matrix. b Active TGF-β will first bind to transforming growth
  factor-β receptor II (TGFBRII) dimer before forming a complex with transforming
  growth factor-β receptor I (TGFBRI) dimer. Activated TGFBRI recruits Smad2/3 and
  phosphorylates the carboxyl-terminal of Smad2/3. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 will associate
  with Smad4 and other co-factors before forming a transcription factor complex to
  regulate gene expression
