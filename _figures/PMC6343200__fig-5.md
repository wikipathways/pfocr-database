caption: 'Latency-reversing agents of the “shock and kill” approach. (A) The “shock
  and kill” approach consists of using small compounds known as LRAs (shown above
  in blue and red) to activate latent provirus in cART-treated patients to facilitate
  reservoirs clearance by viral cytopathic effects or HIV-specific cytotoxic T cell
  response in in conjunction with cART to protect uninfected cell from de novo infection.
  (B) Multiple classes of LRAs have been described: (1) HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) target
  HDACs to increase histone acetylation at 5′ LTR; (2) HMTis inhibit HMTs and lead
  to decreased methylation; (3) protein kinase C agonists (PKCas) utilize the PKC
  pathway to lead to NF-κB-dependent HIV-1 transcription; (4) bromodomain extra-terminal
  motif inhibitors that block the interaction between BRD4 and P-TEFb or induce P-TEFb
  release from 7SK snRNP to increase its recruitment at the 5′ LTR. Other LRAs include
  dilsufram (possibly acting via Akt/IP3 pathway), DNMTis, and cytokines such as IL7,
  TNFα, IL15 and TLR agonist 3,4 and 7 (not shown). DNMTis, DNMT inhibitors; HMTis,
  HMT inhibitors; IL, interleukin; LRAs, latency-reversing agents; TNFα, tumor necrosis
  alpha.'
