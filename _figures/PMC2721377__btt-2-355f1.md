caption: Schematic representation of molecular toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the human
  gastrointestinal (GI) tract which act as sensors and are the first responders in
  the major pathway by which the immune system detects infection or damaged tissue.
  Their biological function makes them attractive targets for designing various biotherapeutic
  molecules for such disorders as inflammation, infections, autoimmunity, allergies
  and cancer.
