caption: 'Different mechanisms of crosstalk between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
  (PDAC) cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). (A) Communication
  between PDAC cancer cells harboring mutant KRASG12D and CAFs can occur via a reciprocal
  signaling network. (B) PDAC cancer cells with mutant p53 (p53 mut), which exhibit
  persistent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  and enhanced activity of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway, influence
  CAFs in a paracrine manner or through exosome secretion, stimulating the deposition
  of extracellular matrix (ECM). (C) CAFs can also secrete paracrine factors acting
  on cancer cells that lead to an upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) and STAT3 signaling and finally to PDAC progression and chemoresistance.
  Both CAF-secreted factors and direct PDAC–CAF interactions can further induce PDAC
  stem cell features, thereby promoting self-renewal capacity and invasiveness. Abbreviations:
  sonic hedgehog (SHH); insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1); insulin-like growth factor
  1 receptor (IGFR1); growth arrest-specific gene 6 (GAS6); tumor necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α); transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β); leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).'
