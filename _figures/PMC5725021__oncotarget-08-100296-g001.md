caption: Tamoxifen is demethylated to N desmethyltamoxifen (NDM) mainly by CYP3A4/5.
  A relatively smaller proportion of tamoxifen is converted by CYP2D6 to 4-hydroxytamoxifen
  (4-OH tamoxifen). NDM is metabolized to endoxifen by CYP2D6, and 4-OH tamoxifen
  is metabolized to endoxifen by CYP3A4 []. In addition to these enzymes, various
  CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C9, etc.) are involved in the metabolism of tamoxifen.
  Tamoxifen and its metabolites are further inactivated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases
  (UGTs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs) [, ].
