caption: TgATS1-iKO parasites were grown in the presence of 12C-glucose or U-13C-glucose
  in the presence or absence of ATc. Glucose is metabolized via the parasite glycolytic
  pathway into dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). These
  precursors are imported into the apicoplast via the apicoplast phosphate transporter
  (APT). PEP can then be transformed into acetyl-CoA via the action of the apicoplast
  pyruvate kinase (PK) and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Acetyl-CoA serves
  as a substrate for the FASII pathway to generate growing acyl chains on an acyl
  carrier protein (ACP) scaffold. Glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P) can be generated from
  imported DHAP by the apicoplast glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpda), or potentially
  by an as yet unidentified cytosolic G3P dehydrogenase (G3PDH). Both labelled and/or
  unlabelled G3P and FA can be used as a substrate by the apicoplast TgATS1 (glycerol
  3-phosphate acyltransferase) to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). These LPA species
  can potentially be exported from the apicoplast towards the ER to be assembled into
  phospholipids (PL) and/or have its FA elongated via the three ER elongases (ELO).
  In order to assess ER elongation, TgATS1-iKO parasites were grown in the presence
  or absence of ATc together with 12C-acetate or U-13C-acetate, which is metabolized
  to cytosolic acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). Collectively, this strategy
  enabled the determination of (i) apicoplast FASII-generated FA products, (ii) products
  assembled via TgATS1, and (iii) PL species generated via the apicoplast. Total lipid
  extracts from TgATS1-iKO parasites grown in the described conditions were analyzed
  by two mass spectrometry techniques. GC-MS was used for the measurement of total
  FA profiles and LC-MS/MS was used to determine the relative amounts of 13C incorporation
  into individual PL molecular species. In the cartoon, unlabelled and labelled moieties
  are shown in black and red, respectively.
