caption: 'Genes frequently mutated in colorectal cancer and their relationships with
  miRNAs. Genes frequently mutated in CRC (highlighted in orange) regulate and are
  regulated by miRNAs. Oncogenic miRNAs are depicted in blue, tumor-suppressive miRNAs
  in red, and miRNAs with reported pleiotropic effects in purple. Direct relationships
  are shown with solid lines, while indirect relationships are illustrated with dotted
  lines. The Wnt pathway is augmented by miR-135b, miR-21 and miR-155, and inhibited
  by miR-34a, miR-29b/c. Downstream of Wnt, MYC transcriptionally activates the miR-17-92
  locus, but represses expression of miR-15, miR-26 and miR-30. KRAS augments expression
  of miR-31. MYC and KRAS promote cell cycle progression (CC, circular arrows). In
  the PI3K pathway, which is negatively regulated by PTEN, miR-135b is augmented by
  PI3K inhibition of FoxO transcription factors (FOXO1 and FOXO3A), which represses
  cell cycle progression. MiR-221, miR-21 and miR-17/106 enhance activation of PI3K
  signaling by repressing negative regulators of this pathway. MiRNAs also modulate
  inflammatory pathways mediated by the transcription factors NFΚB and STAT3 by directly
  inhibiting IL-6 (via Let-7 miRNAs, which are inhibited by LIN28B) or the IL-6 receptor
  (via miR-34 and miR-125b). MiR-221/222 and miR-29b/c can also augment this pathway
  via indirect stimulatory effects on IL-6, NFΚB, and STAT3. The TGF-β pathway, which
  is important for repressing cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression is
  also antagonized by several miRNAs, including miR-17/106, miR-135b, and miR-20a
  through effects on TGFBR2 and SMAD4. The miRNA miR-93 can stimulate the TGF-β pathway
  by repressing the inhibitory SMAD7, although the effect of miR-93 is inhibitory
  of Wnt signaling through inhibition of SMAD7, which can augment nuclear accumulation
  of β-catenin. Lastly, several miRNAs have effects on EMT in CRC tumorigenesis, with
  miR-15/16 and miR-34 (which are transcriptionally activated by TP53) inhibiting
  this process, while miR-21 enhances EMT. References for the effects of these miRNAs
  can be found in  or in the main text. Official human gene symbols and full names:
  APC, adenomatous polyposis coli or WNT signaling pathway regulator; CTNNB1, β-catenin;

  viral oncogene homolog or proto-oncogene and GTPase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
