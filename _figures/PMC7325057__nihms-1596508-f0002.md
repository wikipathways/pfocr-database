caption: Aerobactin biosynthesis is catalyzed by four enzymes. A. IucD and IucB catalyze
  the sequential hydroxylation and acetylation of the N6 amino group of lysine to
  produce N6-acetyl-N6-hydroxylysine (ahLys). B. Two molecules of ahLys are then sequentially
  installed on the primary carboxylates of citrate to form aerobactin. C. The two-step
  reaction catalyzed by IucA involves the initial adenylation of citrate to form the
  citryl-AMP intermediate. This reacts in a second partial reaction with the α-amino
  group of ahLys to form the biosynthetic intermediate harboring a single ahLys adduct.
