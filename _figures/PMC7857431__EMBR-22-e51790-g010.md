caption: PenG induces ETC dysfunction during transition of cell shape from rod to
  spheroplast, resulting in the production of ROS. Hydrogen peroxide illegitimately
  induces the Fur regulon, resulting in the upregulation of iron acquisition systems,
  resulting in enhanced iron influx and lethal oxygen radical generation. VxrAB dampens
  this response by downregulating iron acquisition genes, in addition to its primary
  role as a positive regulator of cell wall synthesis genes. SO, superoxide.
