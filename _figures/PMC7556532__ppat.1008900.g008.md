caption: HER2 interacts with all members of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) receptor
  family to form heterodimers. In TAM receptor-mediated cellular entry, EBOV particles
  attach to the cell surface by binding to a TAM receptor (e.g., TYRO3) via the serum
  protein GAS6 (1). HER2 also interacts with the virus-bound TYRO3, forming a HER2/TYRO3/EBOV
  complex on the cell surface (2). The formation of this complex leads to HER2 phosphorylation
  (either autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by an as yet unknown cellular factor)
  and the phosphorylation of TYRO3 by HER2 (3), leading to downstream activation of
  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway (HER2-mediated AKT1 activation) (4) and subsequent induction
  of macropinocytosis (5). After internalization of the HER2/TYRO3/EBOV complexes
  into early endosomes via macropinocytosis (6), the complexes are disassociated,
  and only EBOV particles are delivered to late the endosomes/lysosomes, where later
  events such as membrane fusion occur. HER2 and TYRO3 are most likely recycled back
  to the cell surface.
