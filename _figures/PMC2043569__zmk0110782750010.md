caption: Proposed regulatory links between the SAPK and the cell integrity pathways
  by protein phosphatases (shaded figures) during growth and osmostress. Pyp1p, Pyp2p,
  and Ptc1p protein phosphatases are negative regulators of MAPK Sty1p and MAPK Pmk1
  activities, whereas Pmp1 only dephosphorylates MAPK Pmk1p (⊥, inhibition). The expression/synthesis
  of the shared phosphatases is in turn under Sty1p/Atf1p-dependent and Sty1p/Atf1p-independent
  (X-dependent) regulation. The size of the discontinuous arrows indicates the relative
  transcriptional reliance. The question mark shows that the corresponding transcription
  factor is unknown. For more details on abbreviations and symbols, see .
