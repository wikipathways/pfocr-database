caption: A proposed model of anticancer effects using CCBs combined with chemotherapy
  to induce cell death on chemoresistant lung cancer cells. Administration of VER
  or DIL induces autophagy; and death ratios of chemoresistant cells were significantly
  increased when VER combined with chemotherapy. Both caspase-dependent and independent
  cell death mechanisms contribute to the anticancer effects of VER/chemotherapy.
  Knockdown of ATG5 by shATG5 reduced caspase-dependent cell death. Whereas, accumulation
  of autophagosomes by VER/chemotherapy or CQ results in cells to be burst in a caspase-independent
  pathway of cell death.
