caption: Members of the RB pathway that are expressed in hESCs are shown. CKIs (INK4
  family and Cip/Kip family) are expressed at low or undetectable levels. In contrast
  to mESCs where RB family members (RBf) are thought to be always hyperphosphorylated
  (P represents a phosphorylated residue), RB is found in a hypophosphorylated state
  in G1 in hESCs and becomes hyperphosphorylated for the rest of the cell cycle. Increased
  size of the Cyclin/CDK complexes reflects an increase of Cyclin E and Cyclin A protein
  levels and activity near the G1/S transition.
