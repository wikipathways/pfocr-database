caption: Summary of proposed role for Foxa2, Nodal and Hh signalling pathways in ventral
  CNS development. The model is based upon data in this paper and in other papers
  cited in the text. Nodal signalling induces MFP through Madh/Smad and FoxH1/Fast/Sur
  transcription factors. This occurs in the absence of Foxa2 function, implicating
  other factors downstream of Nodal in the earliest induction of floorplate identity.
  Nodal signalling induces foxa2 expression in MFP and Foxa2 function is required
  for differentiation of these cells. Hh genes are among those requiring Foxa2 function
  for maintained expression. However, as Hh genes are initially expressed in mol-/-
  embryos, we suggest that other transcription factors, including Madh2/FoxH1, contribute
  to the presence of Hh proteins in the ventral neural tube. The only known role for
  Hh proteins in the MFP is to maintain expression of differentiation markers. Hh
  signals working through Gli proteins induce foxa2 expression in the LFP. Foxa2 activity
  is required for proper formation of the LFP and this is likely to be due both to
  non-autonomous roles (e.g. regulation of Hh production in the MFP), and activity
  within the LFP itself. Hh activity also spreads further to induce and pattern adjacent
  ventral CNS cell types, including cranial motoneurones and serotonergic raphé neurones.
  In the absence of Foxa2 function, Hh activity leads to ectopic dorsal expression
  of several Hh pathway target genes. This implies that Foxa2 may also negatively
  regulate the dorsal spread of Hh activity within the ventral CNS.
