caption: p53 signaling pathway. In unstressed conditions, p53 has a short half-life,
  being normally kept at low levels by MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is itself
  a transcriptional target of p53, inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity and targeting
  it for proteasomal degradation via polyubiquitination (Ub). p53 is activated by
  stress stimuli, such as DNA damage, which activate the upstream kinases ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR), leading
  to p53 phosphorylation by checkpoint kinase (CHK)1 and CHK2. Other cellular stresses
  include hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or oncogene activation, which dislocate p53
  from the regulation of inhibitors (e.g., MDM2) through post-translational modifications
  (PTM), like phosphorylation (P) and acetylation (Ac), inducing stabilization, rapid
  accumulation, and activation of p53. Molecular chaperones, including Heat Shock
  Proteins (HSPs), through transient cyclic bind-unwind-release reactions, assist
  p53 to adopt its proper tertiary and quaternary structure and carry out its tumor
  suppressor activities. Depending on the stimulus, cell context, or PTM pattern,
  active p53 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several target genes involved
  in the control of major cellular processes, including cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA
  repair, autophagy, senescence, metabolism, metastasis, and angiogenesis. p53 also
  plays transcription-independent mitochondrial roles, as it can directly bind to
  BAX/BAK, resulting in their activation and initiation of apoptosis; p53 can also
  bind to BCL-2/BCL-xL, inhibiting their anti-apoptotic functions, through the disruption
  of inhibitory complexes between BCL-xL/BCL-2 with BAK/BAX, which results in mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), cytochrome c (cyt c) release, and subsequent
  apoptosis.
