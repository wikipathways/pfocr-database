caption: 'Cellular regulation of NRF2 under normal and stressed cellular conditions:
  NRF2 is recognized as master regulator of cellular redox homeostasis. Under basal
  conditions, NRF2 remains bound to an adaptor protein KEAP1 and is maintained at
  a low level in the cytoplasm through ubiquitination followed by proteosomal degradation.
  Under stressed conditions NRF2 is instead released from KEAP1 then translocate and
  accumulate in the nucleus where it binds to the ARE sequence. Activation of the
  NRF2-ARE pathway triggers the transcription of multiple genes involved in the expression
  of antioxidants, efflux transporters, phase I & II enzymes, glutathione and ATP
  synthesis, etc.).'
