caption: The gut–brain axis communication is bidirectional and mediated by several
  pathways. This communication is performed through hormonal (hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
  axis), metabolic (short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitters), and immunologic
  pathways. Moreover, the gut microbiome interacts with the brain through the enteric
  nervous system and vagus nerve, which can be influenced either by the gut microbiota
  itself or indirectly through a local effect on the pathway by neuroactive compounds
  (eg, noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine, tryptophan, and short-chain fatty acid).
