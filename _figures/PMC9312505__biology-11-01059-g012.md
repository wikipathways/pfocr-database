caption: 'HSC internalization of ABs generated from alcohol- and HIV-exposed hepatocytes
  induced ROS and IL6-mediated HSC activation. The mechanistic steps include: 1. Both
  the alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde, and HIV trigger hepatocyte apoptosis. This
  leads to the generation of HIV and MDA-containing hepatocyte ABs which express PtylS.
  2. HSC internalizes HIV and MDA-containing ABs through Axl, a PtylSRR, with the
  help of the two bridging molecules, Gas 6 and protein S. 3. The release of HIV proteins,
  HIV gag RNA and MDA into HSC by internalized ABs triggers intracellular ROS generation.
  This ROS mediates JNK activation, which leads to the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2
  pathway. 4. Nuclear translocation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 induced the biosynthesis
  of profibrotic genes. 5. The delivery of HIV and MDA into HSC by internalized ABs
  induced IL-6 synthesis required to activate the JAK-STAT3 pathway. The activated
  STAT3 leads to the biosynthesis of profibrotic genes. 6. Activation of profibrotic
  genes in HSC promotes liver fibrosis development.'
