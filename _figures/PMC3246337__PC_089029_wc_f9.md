caption: A Proposed Model Illustrating the Interaction between Ethylene Signaling
  and Auxin Biosynthesis in the Regulation of Root Elongation.Ethylene acts to stabilize
  EIN3 through its canonical signaling pathway, and the accumulated EIN3 transcription
  factor activates the expression of several auxin biosynthetic genes, including WEI2,
  WEI7, TAA1, and TAR2. WEI2 and WEI7 are required for Trp production, while TAA1
  and TAR2 (and probably other TARs as well) convert Trp into IPyA, which eventually
  leads to the synthesis of IAA and the inhibition of root elongation. In addition
  to promoting ethylene biosynthesis, IAA is also able to enhance EIN3 stability probably
  by repressing EBF1/2-mediated EIN3 degradation, forming a positive feedback loop
  between ethylene signaling and auxin biosynthesis. Kyn has been identified in this
  study as a small compound that competitively and selectively inhibits the family
  of TAA1/TARs.[See online article for color version of this figure.]
