caption: Roles of FFA2 in immune cell populations. In neutrophils, activation of FFA2
  triggers chemotaxis and potentially promotes neutrophil survival or apoptosis, promotes
  superoxide production (in crosstalk with P2Y2R) and the production of the cytokine
  IL-1β. Complementing this action, in ILC3 cells, activation of FFA2 leads to an
  upregulation of IL-1R, which is in turn activated by IL-1β to produce IL-22. FFA2
  activation also directly leads to IL-22 production via the Akt/ERK1/2- signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3– RAR-related orphan receptor γ t axis in these
  cells. In dendritic cells, activation leads to the production of BAFF and A2ALD1a2,
  the latter of which catalyses the production of retinoic acid, which along with
  BAFF promotes B-cell differentiation into plasma cells. FFA2 may also be involved
  in IgA/IgG release via an unknown mechanism. Activation of FFA2 in type 2 macrophages
  promotes the release of TNFα, as well as bacteriocidal activity through an unknown
  pathway. FFA2 may also function as a coreceptor for the influenza A virus, triggering
  a β-arrestin-1-dependent internalisation of the virus. AKT, protein kinase B; ALDH1A2,
