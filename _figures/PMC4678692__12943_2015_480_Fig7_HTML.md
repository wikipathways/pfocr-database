caption: A summary of the relationships between miR-214, UCP2, beclin-1, LC3-II, Bax,
  Caspase-9, PARP, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR after TAM/FUL treatment. TAM/FUL treatment results
  in autophagy as well as apoptosis. MiR-214 increased the sensitivity of breast cancer
  cells to the 4-OHT/FUL-induced apoptosis through inhibition of autophagy. UCP2 was
  identified to be a direct target of miR-214. Overexpression of UCP2 inhibited TAM/FUL-induced
  cell apotosis by increasing autophagy possibly through activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
  signaling pathway, thereby contributing to endocrine resistance

  and fulvestrant through inhibition of autophagy.
