caption: Lipid metabolism and its predicted regulatory mechanism in C. glutamicum.
  For fatty acid biosynthesis, C. glutamicum uses two type I fatty acid synthases
  (FAS-I), FasA and FasB, in addition to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc), consisting
  of AccBC, AccD1, and AccE. The products of the FAS-I pathway are believed to be
  acyl-CoAs (), which are used for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids and the
  outer layer components mycolic acids. FasB is also involved in the synthesis of
  octanoic acid (C8), a precursor of lipoic acid (). This organism is naturally unable
  to degrade fatty acids, since three genes (gray arrows) responsible for the β-oxidation
  of fatty acids are missing from the C. glutamicum genome (). Based on knowledge
  of related bacteria, acyl-CoAs are thought to inhibit Acc, FasA, and FasB (, ).
  The repressor protein FasR, combined with the effector acyl-CoAs, represses the
  expressions for accD1, fasA, and fasB (, ). Repression and predicted inhibition
  are indicated by double lines. Arrows with solid and dotted lines represent single
  and multiple enzymatic processes, respectively. FadE, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; EchA,
