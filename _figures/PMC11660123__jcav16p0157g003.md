caption: Mechanisms of AIM2 in regulating the development of breast cancer and LUAD
  independent of inflammasome. AIM2 exerts its anti-cancer effects through multiple
  mechanisms, including the promotion of cancer cell apoptosis via modulation of sub-G1
  phase cells and inhibition of NF-κB. Additionally, AIM2 can impede cancer progression
  by downregulating Bcl-xL expression and upregulating Bad and Bax expression, resulting
  in Caspase 3 activation and subsequent PARP cleavage. Furthermore, AIM2 can enhance
  Caspase 3 and DFNA5 expression, leading to breast cancer cell pyroptosis and inhibition
  of tumor growth. Moreover, AIM2 activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway by inhibiting
  mitochondrial fusion, thereby increasing ROS production. Furthermore, AIM2 has the
  capability to activate the JAK/STAT3 pathway, leading to the promotion of M2 polarization
  in macrophages and increased PD-L1 expression, while also inhibiting CD8+ T cell
  infiltration via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Additionally, AIM2 can facilitate the progression
  of LUAD by suppressing the expression of caspase-1 and IL-1β
