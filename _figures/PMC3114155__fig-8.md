caption: Effect of long-term, high altitude hypoxia on the adaptation of uterine artery
  contractions to pregnancy. Pregnancy inhibits the PKC/ERK1/2 signaling pathway,
  resulting in attenuated α1-adrenorecptor (α1-AR)-mediated phasic contractions and
  decreased baseline Ca2+ sensitivity and vascular tone in the uterine arteries. Long-term,
  high altitude hypoxia during pregnancy preserves the pregnancy-mediated, low vascular,
  sympathetic reactivity, but increases the baseline Ca2+ sensitivity and vascular
  tone via a PKC/ERK1/2-mediated thin-filament pathway. Broken arrows indicate downregulation.
  Solid arrows indicate upregulation.
