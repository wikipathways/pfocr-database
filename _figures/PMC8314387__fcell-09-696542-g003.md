caption: 'Cross-talks among signaling pathways. (A) PI3K/Akt signaling pathway: PI3K
  is activated to transform PIP2 into PIP3, which promotes the accumulation of Akt
  with the assistance of PDK1 at the plasma membrane. Activated Akt then translocates
  into nucleus to exert its biological function. (B) JAK/STAT signaling pathway: The
  signaling cascade of JAK/STAT signaling pathway including JAK activation, tyrosine
  phosphorylation, and STAT recruiting. Then, the STAT is transported to nucleus to
  regulate gene transcription. (C) TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway: Activated TGF-β binds
  to its receptors and thus phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3. Smad2/3 then forms an
  oligomeric complex with Smad4, which translocates into the nucleus to regulate the
  transcription of target genes. (D) Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway: The Wnt binds
  to the frizzled receptor, which works together with the LRP5 and LRP6 co-receptors
  to inhibit the ubiquitination of destruction complex. Therefore, the degradation
  activity of β-catenin is limited, causing the accumulation of β-catenin, which translocates
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate the transcription. (E) Notch signaling
  pathway: Upon the combination of the receptor Notch, and the ligand JAG and DL,
  Notch transforms to the activated form NICD, which enters the nucleus to regulate
  the expression of downstream targets. (F) TGF-β directly activates PI3K and subsequently
  stimulates Akt production. (G) TGF-β can activate both JAK and STAT, and the activation
  of JAK subsequently stimulates the phosphorylation of STAT3. (H) The activation
  of the TGF-β/Smad pathway stimulates MAPK, while MAPK directly induces the phosphorylation
  of the linker of Smad3, thereby promoting the transcriptional activity of Smad.
  Extracellular MAPK activation can stimulate latent TGF-β in mesangial cells via
  TSP-1 or AP-1. (I) TGF-β pathway activates Wnt pathway by downregulating the level
  of Wnt antagonist DKK1. β-catenin can bind with Smad3, promoting the transcription
  of Smads. (J) TGF-β pathway upregulates the ligand of Notch, such as JAG, to transform
  Notch to NICD. NICD can interact directly with Smad3, which is enhanced by TGF-β
  administration. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate;
