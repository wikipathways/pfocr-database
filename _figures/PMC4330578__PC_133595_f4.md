  vascular patterning by , PIN7 transcription is promoted by cytokinin response. In
  the model of vascular tissue formation by , cytokinin inhibits the localization
  of PIN on the membrane independently of cytokinin response. Furthermore, in this
  model, there is an additional regulation on PIN polarity whereby auxin in neighboring
  cells polarizes auxin toward the membrane. In both models, the PINs transport auxin
  out of the cell and therefore reduce auxin concentration within the cell (dashed
  lines) and auxin inhibits cytokinin response (either through AHP6 or other as yet
  unidentified components). The regulation of cytokinin synthesis by auxin (via ARF5,
  TMO5, LHW, and LOG4) is a linear pathway, and as such De Rybel et al. didn’t model
  the components individually. However, the complete pathway is shown alongside in
  blue, so that the reader can see how these components are included within the regulatory
  network.
