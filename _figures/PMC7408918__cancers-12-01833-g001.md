caption: Androgen at supraphysiological level (SAL) induces cellular senescence through
  the PI3K/Src/Akt/mTOR pathway. In the cytoplasm, androgen receptor (AR) forms a
  complex with heat shock proteins (HSPs). Activation of the AR is triggered by binding
  of androgens (AR agonist) to the receptor. Androgen-activated AR dissociates from
  HSPs, and subsequently mediates AR signaling. (1) The majority of activated AR forms
  homodimer and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to androgen response
  element (ARE) at the promoter of the target genes and mediates transcription. (2)
  A minor fraction of activated AR remains in the cytoplasm, interacts with and functions
  through several signaling molecules, e.g., Src, PI3K/Akt, S6, Ras/Raf1, MAPK/ERK.
  Interestingly, co-treatment of SAL with inhibitors of PI3K (3-MA), Src family members
  (PP2), Akt (Akti), or mTOR (Rapamycin) inhibits senescence induction. This indicates
  that Src/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in SAL-mediated cellular senescence in
  PCa cells.
