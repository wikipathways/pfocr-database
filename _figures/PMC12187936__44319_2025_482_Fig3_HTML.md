caption: '(A) Bacteria residing in tumors can promote anti-tumoral immunity through
  various mechanisms. (1) CD8+ T-cell activation: Lactobacillus reuteri and Fusobacterium
  nucleatum enhance CD8+ T-cell activity by releasing the metabolic products (postbiotics)
  indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) and butyric acid, respectively. I3A activates the aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor (AhR) in CD8+ T cells, stimulating interferon gamma (IFN-γ) production
  and improving anti-PD-L1 therapy efficacy. Butyric acid, on the other hand, triggers
  a signaling pathway involving TBX21 (T-bet) in CD8+ T cells, resulting in PD-1 suppression
  and increased T-cell effector activity. (2) Modulation of major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) class-I expression: a postbiotic derived from Lactobacillus paracasei
  elevates MHC class-I expression on cancer cells, promoting the recruitment and activation
  of antigen-specific T cells, ultimately enhancing anti-PD-1 immunotherapy efficacy.
  (3) Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) induction: Helicobacter hepaticus drives
  the formation and maturation of tumor-associated TLSs enhancing anti-tumoral immunity
  through CD4+ T follicular helper cells and B cells, leading to tumor growth control.
  (4) Improvement of antigen-presenting capacities: Bifidobacterium boosts antigen-presenting
  capabilities of dendritic cells (DC) through STING signaling, promoting a favorable
  response to anti-CD47 immunotherapy. (B) Tumor-resident bacteria can favor pro-tumoral
  immunity in several ways. (1) iNKT conversion to a pro-tumoral phenotype: Porphyromonas
  gingivalis and F. nucleatum modulate iNKT cell activity. P gingivalis hampers iNKT
  cytotoxicity by upregulating the chitinase 3-like-1 protein (CHI3L1), leading to
  reduced expression of cytotoxic cytokines. (2) Macrophages recruitment: F. nucleatum
  favors infiltration of macrophages via CCL20 and their polarization to the pro-tumoral
  M2 phenotype. (3) Recruitment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN): P. gingivalis
  and F.nucleatum drive the accumulation of TANs within the TME. P. gingivalis induces
  the upregulation of neutrophil-attracting chemokines and the release of neutrophil
  elastase (NE) by TANs, promoting cancer development'
