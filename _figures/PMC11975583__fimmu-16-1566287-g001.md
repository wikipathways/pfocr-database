caption: Schematic diagram of curcumin treatment improving skin damage caused by UVB
  irradiation. Curcumin intervention significantly enhanced the YAP signaling pathway,
  led to increased mitochondrial autophagy, and inhibited the IL-18 pathway, thereby
  combating UVB-induced oxidative and inflammatory damage
