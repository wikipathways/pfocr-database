caption: RANKL/RANK/OPG is the most important signaling pathway regulating osteoclasts
  formation. The interaction between RANK and RANKL (which can exacerbate this effect
  in the presence of M-CSF) promotes the recruitment of the TRAF family bridging proteins,
  one of which TRAF6 contributes to OC formation and activation of the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, leading to the transcription of genes involved in OC formation and OC production.
  OPG is a decoy receptor that binds RANKL and can block the binding and activation
  of RANK and RANKL, reducing OC production. TNF-α/NF-κB is an inflammatory signaling
  pathway. In the presence of TNF-α, NF-κB pathway is activated, OC production is
  increased, and the interaction between RANKL and RANK is enhanced, which results
  in activation of the downstream signaling pathways. In addition to the above-mentioned
  effects, TNF-α also synergizes with RANKL and directly promotes OC production. In
  the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, the expression of genes involved in OC formation
  leading to the development of mature OC.
