caption: P450 isozymes contributing to reaction steps of each terbinafine N-dealkylation
  pathway have been identified and scaled based on reaction efficiency and relative
  abundance in human liver microsomes to model contributions in adult human liver
  conditions. Higher contributions for individual isozymes relative to others are
  indicated by larger font size and boldness for reactions in Pathway 1 (red), Pathway
  2 (blue), and Pathway 3 (green).
