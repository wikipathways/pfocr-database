caption: The core regulatory machinery of the PHO pathway consisting of the CDK complex
  and the transcription factor Pho4 is conserved across the fungal species shown.
  However, evidence of Pho2 coregulation is absent in the fungal pathogens analysed.
  Pho4-dependent genes were assigned to GO groups with only the most abundant groups
  displayed in the analysis. Data for the comparison were assembled from Ogawa, 2000
  (S. cerevisiae) []; Ikeh, 2016 (C. albicans) []; He, 2017 (C. glabrata) []; and
  Toh-e, 2015 (C. neoformans) []. GO annotation for C. neoformans JEC21 is publicly
  available at http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=jec21&sort=score and https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Cryne_JEC21_1/Cryne_JEC21_1.home.html.
  Phosphate homeostasis-related genes in C. neoformans (blue) were manually annotated
  based on S. cerevisiae GO groups. GO groups in common are color coded. Note for
  C. neoformans that “transmembrane transport” is a child GO term for “transport”
  emphasizing the role of Pho4-dependent nutrient transport in this pathogen.
