caption: The mevalonate pathway supports mitochondrial function by providing ubiquinone
  and heme A that support the electron transport chain and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) for GTPases that promote survival. Cancers that have lost p53 function (p53
  LOF) depend on the mevalonate pathway to support pyrimidine synthesis through the
  ubiquinone-reducing, dihydroorotate (DHO) dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme. Statins
  induce the production of reactive oxygen species. A MEK-NRF2-mediated compensatory
  increase of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, xCT, provides resistance to oxidation
  by supporting glutathione synthesis, which can be prevented by combining statins
  with the clinical MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. Furthering oxidative phosphorylation
  (Ox Phos) dysfunction with Ox Phos inhibitors synergize with statins to induce cell
  death. GPX4 and FSP1 depend on mevalonate pathway outputs to prevent lipid peroxidation
  and sensitization to ferroptosis. Inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation in blood
  cancers (via statins or GGTIs) results in the increase of p53-upregulated modulator
  of apoptosis (PUMA) in a p53 independent manner. Statin-induced PUMA sensitizes
  to the clinical BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax (Veneto), by disrupting anti-apoptotic
  interactions of BCL-2 as well as MCL-1 Release of the BH3 activator, BIM, induces
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP) resulting in cytochrome c (Cyto
  C) release and blood cancer apoptosis.
