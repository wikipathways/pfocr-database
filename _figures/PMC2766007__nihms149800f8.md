caption: Schematic diagram depicting the mechanism of PTxB-mediated desensitization
  of CXCR4. A, SDF-1α binding to the extracellular domains of CXCR4 causes a conformational
  change in CXCR4, enabling activation of associated G proteins. Gαi proteins inhibit
  adenylate cyclase while the βγ proteins trigger an intracellular Ca2+ release. These
  events, in addition to others, result in cellular chemotaxis to SDF-1α. B, Treatment
  with the B subunit of PTx or an anti-CD3 (αCD3) mAb initiates the TCR signaling
  pathway resulting in the activation of many proteins, including a variety of kinases.
  We propose that kinases (PKCs or GRKs) activated by the TCR can phosphorylate CXCR4
  to promote its internalization and uncoupling from G proteins. Subsequently, the
  decreased availability of CXCR4 on the cell surface and/or is inability to couple
  to G proteins results in CXCR4 that cannot respond to SDF-1α. Thus, TCR signaling
  results in a rapid and transient block of chemotaxis to SDF-1α.
