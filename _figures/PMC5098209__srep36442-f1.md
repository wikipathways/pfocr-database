caption: Proteins from pooled H. pylori strains from DU patients or GC patients (n = 5
  per group) were digested and labeled separately with different iTRAQ reagents in
  three independent repeats, then the labeled peptides were combined and separated
  on a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos hybrid mass spectrometer. Increased expression (>1.5-fold)
  in GC-derived H. pylori strains than in DU-derived H. pylori strains and proteins
  related to host signaling by KEGG pathway mapping were used as criteria for selection
  of candidates, and the candidates were validated by RT-PCR and Western blotting.
  The selected candidates were then verified by reaction with patients’ serum samples,
  and a GC-related protein microarray platform was established to perform rapid diagnosis
  testing.
