caption: A model for the biosynthesis, intracellular trafficking, and secretion of
  aflatoxins via a concerted mechanism involving peroxisomes, lipid droplets (LDs),
  and endomembrane components. In this scheme, the caleosin/peroxygenase (CLO/PXG)
  enzyme, located on LDs, is a component of oxylipin metabolism that converts fatty
  acyl peroxides (FA-OOH) to fatty acyl hydroxides (FA-OH). This is part of the oxidative
  signaling cascade that regulates the expression of several components of the aflatoxin
  (AF) gene cluster located in the nucleus. AF biosynthesis begins in peroxisomes
  with the β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) to acetyl-CoA which is then
  converted to the polyketide, Norsolorinic acid (Nor Acid), via polyketide synthase.
  Vesicles and LDs, loaded with Nor Acid, then bud off from peroxisomes (and possibly
  also from mitochondria) and are trafficked via CVT (cytoplasmic vacuole targeting)
  vesicles that contain middle and late aflatoxin enzymes such as Nor-1, Ver-1, and
  Omt-A. The aflatoxin-loaded vesicles fuse with secretory vesicles to form aflatoxisomes
  that can either be recycled via the vacuole or secreted from the cell (black arrows).
  In the alternative pathway that has been elucidated in this study, LDs can also
  become loaded with AF and can then either be recycled via the vacuole or secreted
  from the cell (red arrows). Silencing of the AfCLO gene results in the downregulation
  of several key AF gene cluster components, as well as much reduced LD accumulation
  and an almost total cessation of AF biosynthesis and secretion.
