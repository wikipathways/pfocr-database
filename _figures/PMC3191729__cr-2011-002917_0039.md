caption: Schematic representation of the locations in and outside of the cell where
  sphingolipids are metabolized and trafficked. The black dashed lines show the traditional
  biosynthetic pathway beginning with biosynthesis of the lipid backbone in the ER
  and subsequent trafficking through the Golgi for further metabolism, leading ultimately
  to movement to the plasma membrane and other parts of the cell via vesicles and
  transport proteins (e.g., GLTP) or across the membrane via pumps (ABC, etc.). The
  green arrows reflect inward movement of sphingolipids destined to lysosomes or to
  the ER via retrograde motion. The red lines represent additional trafficking of
  sphingolipids; for examples, for autophagosome formation, formation of multivesicular
  endosomes and multivesicular bodies, and fusion with the plasma membrane as shown.
