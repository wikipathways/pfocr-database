caption: The different 2-OGDs involved in flavonoids metabolic pathway. The blue-labeled
  enzymes represent the 2-OGDs in flavonoid pathway. The red chemical bonds indicate
  various types of oxidative reactions. F3H, flavonone 3β-hydroxylase; FNS I, flavones
  synthase I; FLS, flavonol synthase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase; S3H, salicylic acid 3-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase.
