caption: The cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) deregulates intracellular signaling
  pathways in B-lymphocytes in tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent
  manners to initiate the lymphomagenesis of Helicobacter pylori (HP)-dependent gastric
  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The HP protein CagA was translocated
  into B lymphocytes and co-immunoprecipitated with phospho-Src homology-2 domain-containing
  phosphatase (SHP-2), and further activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2-associated
  death promoter (BAD), Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. The tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent
  signaling pathway promotes the proliferation and inhibits the apoptosis of B lymphocytes,
  allowing these B-lymphocytes to acquire an oncogenic survival ability and develop
  hematological malignancies. In contrast, the signaling pathways from the CagA tyrosine
  phosphorylation-independent pathway, including the impairment of p53 and inhibition
  of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT, resulted in the suppression of apoptosis and the inhibition
  of proliferation of B-lymphocytes, respectively. The imbalance between apoptosis
  and proliferation leads to the pathogenesis and development of HP-dependent gastric
  MALT lymphoma.
