caption: Application of spatial transcriptomics to rheumatoid arthritis. Key molecular
  pathways and cell interactions in RA synovium are highlighted. In the lining fibroblast
  region, the FGF10–FGFR1 signaling pathway is enhanced in CD55 + cells especially
  in refractory cases. Activation of these fibroblasts is driven by IL-1β from macrophages.
  TNFRS11A expression is upregulated in lining/ superficial sublining fibroblasts
  of treatment-responsive patients. Patients with refractory RA have increased FAP
  expression in the deep sublining fibroblast region. During inflammation, IL-6/MMP3
  + fibroblasts are located near inflammatory immune cells. During remission, ILC2
  cells are located near CD200 + fibroblasts. The CXCL12–CXCR4 pathway–induced interactions
  between B and T cells, the predominance of central memory cells, and pathways like
  leukocyte migration have been explored. In the lymph nodes, patients had reduced
  lymphatic flow and immunoglobulin switching, which are influenced by interactions
  between macrophages and T cells. RA, rheumatoid arthritis; FGF, fibroblast growth
  factor; IL, interleukin; FAP, fibroblast activation protein-α; MMP3, matrix metalloproteinase
  3; ILC2, type 2 innate lymphoid cell
