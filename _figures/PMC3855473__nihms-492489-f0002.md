caption: Tax-specific noncanonical NF-κB pathway. Noncanonical NF-κB signaling pathway
  is stimulated in B cells by the BAFFR and CD40 signals. This pathway is negatively
  regulated by TRAF3, which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 via
  TRAF2 and induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of NIK. The receptor signals induce
  degradation of TRAF3 and TRAF2, leading to accumulation of NIK and NIK/IKKα-mediated
  p100 C-termimal phosphorylation. The phosphorylated p100 is then processed through
  the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and produce the mature NF-κB2 p52 as a dimer with
  RelB. Under normal conditions, active processing of p100 does not occur in T cells.
  However, in HTLV1 infected T cells, Tax initiates an active noncanonical NF-κB pathway
  by bridging p100 and IKKα. In contrast to the cellular pathway, which is independent
  of NEMO, the viral pathway requires NEMO, which may function as an adaptor for Tax/IKKα
  association.
