caption: Metabolic remodeling of cancer cells. In normal cells (left), a large fraction
  of glucose is metabolized to pyruvate that is almost completely oxidized to CO2
  through TCA (Krebs) cycle and OXPHOS in mitochondria, producing a large amount of
  ATP. Pyruvate is metabolized to lactate only in conditions of limiting O2. Instead,
  most cancer cells (right) convert most glucose to lactate regardless of O2 availability
  (Warburg effect). The increased glucose utilization through glycolysis, associated
  to an increase in glutamine utilization, generates metabolic intermediates used
  for the synthesis of nucleic acids through pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), serine
  biosynthesis pathway (SER) and lipid biosynthesis, providing the building blocks
  for the anabolic needs of cancer cells. In addition, neoplastic cells undergo an
  increase in ROS generation, and therefore increase their antioxidant defenses to
  avoid oxidative damage and maintain ROS homeostasis. GLUTs, Glucose Transporters;
  MCTs, Lactate Transporters; SLCs, Solute Carriers.
