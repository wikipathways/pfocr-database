caption: A model deciphering the signalling pathway hijacked by EspT leading to induction
  of inflammatory responses in macrophages. Translocated EspT activates Rac1 and Cdc42
  leading to bacterial internalization in a microfilament (black dash lines)-dependent
  manner. Activation of Rac1 upregulates COX-2, Il-8 and Il-1β genes expression and
  the secretions of PGE2 and Il-1β through Erk, JNK and NF-κB pathways. The dash red
  lines represent the targets of the specific inhibitors used in this study. EspT
  appears to antagonize the inhibitory impact of immunosuppressive effectors translocated
  by EPEC.
