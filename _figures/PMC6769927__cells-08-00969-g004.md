caption: Effects of the different Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) family members
  on articular cartilage biology and osteoarthritis (OA) development. On the left
  healthy articular cartilage is depicted, on the right osteoarthritic cartilage.
  The middle depicts how TGFβ family members regulate matrix turnover, chondrocyte
  proliferation, hypertrophy-like differentiation, and inflammation. An imbalance
  in these effects of TGFβ family members because of age- and/or inflammation-related
  changes contributes to OA development. ADAMTS5 = A disintegrin and metalloproteinase
  with thrombospondin motifs 5, ALPL = Alkaline phosphatase tissue-nonspecific isozyme,
  BAPX-1 = Homeobox protein Nkx-3.2, BMP = Bone morphogenetic protein, GDF = Growth
  differentiation factor, IL = interleukin, MMP = matrix metalloproteinase, NFκb =
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, PRG4 = proteoglycan
  4, RUNX2 = Runt-related transcription factor 2, SOX9 = Transcription factor SOX-9,
  and STAT3 = Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
