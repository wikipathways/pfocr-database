caption: 'Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) regulation in health and disease and its sleep-linked
  effectors and actions. Physiological regulation of TNF (upper pathway) includes
  dampening of TNF production via negative feedback. In contrast, pathogenic stimuli
  can lead to overwhelming positive feedback (lower pathway). TNF can induce its own
  and other pro-inflammatory cytokines to amplify host-defense reactions to pathological
  challenges. Clinically this positive feedback can lead to a cytokine storm with
  the persistence of intense pathological stimuli. Figure abbreviations: CRH, corticotropin-releasing
  hormone; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid; GHRH, growth-hormone-releasing hormone;
  Glu, glutamic acid; IL, interleukin; NE, norepinephrine; NFkB, nuclear factor kappa
  B; NO, nitric oxide; PG, prostaglandins; sTNFR, soluble TNF receptor; TGFβ, transforming
  growth factor β.'
