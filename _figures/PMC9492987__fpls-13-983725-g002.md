caption: 'Schematic diagram of the metabolic pathway analysis and the relative changes
  in metabolites by water limitation in two different soils. The metabolic pathway
  was modified from the KEGG pathway database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html;
  URL accessed on 17 February 2022). The colored squares (blue to red) indicate fold
  changed normalized by water sufficient condition for each soil nutrient condition.
  #Significantly differed metabolites between NE-WS and NE-WL (p < 0.05, Student’s
  t-test).'
