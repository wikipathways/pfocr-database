caption: Notch4+ regulatory T cells contribute to Th2 immunity to allergens and air
  pollutants. Following uptake of ultrafine particles, alveolar macrophages release
  high amounts of IL-6, which promotes Notch4 expression on induced regulatory T cells.
  Notch4 signaling leads to the activation of the Hippo and of the Wnt pathway. Both
  pathways are sufficient to shift regulatory T cells away from immunoregulation.
  Instead, the Wnt and Hippo pathways activate a Th2 and Th17 program in Notch4+regulatory
  T cells. In addition, the Wnt pathway allows GDF-15 release by these cells, and
  GDF-15 triggers IL-13 release by ILC2. The cytokine milieu induced by Notch4+ regulatory
  T cells allows asthma feature to develop and to maintain.
