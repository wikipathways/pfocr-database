caption: A. H-NOX signaling in V. fischeri in the symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail
  squid E. scolopes. Bacteria encounter NO during colonization of the squid light
  organ. NO-bound H-NOX inhibits autophosphorylation of the associated HK. Through
  an uncharacterized phosphorelay system, the NO-bound HnoX downregulates the expression
  of a gene set containing a Fur-binding motif in the promoter region. A subset of
  genes repress hemin-specific iron-uptake and utilization genes. Downregulation of
  intracellular iron levels in response to NO primes V. fischeri for exposure to ROS
  during the course of colonization.B. Interaction between the H-NOX signaling and
  quorum sensing pathway in V. harveyi. Quorum sensing autoinducers control the activity
  of three sensor HKs (CqsS, LuxN and LuxPQ). Phosphotransfer from all three HKs to
  a single Hpt protein, LuxU, and a RR, LuxO, integrates the quorum sensing signal.
  LuxO controls the expression of small regulatory RNAs Qrr1–5, which in turn repress
  LuxR expression. LuxU is the final transcriptional activator of quorum sensing genes,
  regulating bioluminescence and other communal responses. NO-bound HnoK inhibits
  the activity of the associated HqsK histine kinase. HqsK is capable of also phosphorylating
  LuxU, linking NO sensing to expression of quorum sensing genes.
