caption: XRCC1 is instrumental in base excision repair (BER) of small oxidative lesions
  and a related mechanism for the repair of single-strand breaks (SSB-R), both caused
  by ionizing radiation. Oxidative damage and alkylation leads to small alterations
  of bases that are principally repaired through BER pathway. Damaged bases are recognized
  and excised by glycosylases, such as OGG1, which removes the abundant oxidative
  lesion 8-oxodeoxyguanosine. Excision of the damaged base leaves an abasic (AP) site.
  The DNA backbone adjacent to the AP site is incised by APE1 endonuclease to create
  a single-strand break (SSB). XRCC1 has no enzymatic activity, but is critical as
  a scaffolding protein in BER. It is recruited to the site of damage by the glycosylase
  or by PARP1, which binds the newly created SSB. XRCC1 forms a tight complex with
  LIG3, the ligase that seals the SSB repair intermediate to complete BER. Primary
  SSBs, a common consequence of ionizing radiation, are directly recognized by PARP1,
  which recruits XRCC1-LIG3 to repair the broken strand. PNKP removes 3′ phosphate
  groups that block DNA ligation by LIG3. Polβ may be required to replace missing
  nucleotides at the site of the break.
