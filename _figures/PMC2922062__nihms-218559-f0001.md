caption: Hypothetical model for transcriptional regulation of Tspo in hormone- and
  cAMP- responsive MA-10 Leydig cells, and non-responsive NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Data
  presented in this review identified PKCε as the key regulator of Tspo expression.
  Activation of PKCε, mediated through a MAPK-ERK pathway, targets the AP-1, Ets,
  and STAT3 transcription factors, whose binding sites are localized to the −805/−515-bp
  region upstream of the Tspo transcription start site. Ets and Sp1/Sp3 transcription
  factors play a major role in basal Tspo transcription, and epigenetic modifications
  of Tspo may also play a role in its expression. Upon activation, PKCε is translocated
  to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it interacts with the two primary TSPO-associated
  proteins VDAC and ANT. Cross-talk between PKC and cAMP-dependent protein kinase
  (PKA) is possible. Known interactions are denoted by solid lines and hypothetical
  pathways are denoted by dotted lines.
