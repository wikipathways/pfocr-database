caption: Hippo pathway circuitry in Drosophila and in the mammalian liver. (A) Model
  of Drosophila Hippo signaling. Signaling may be initiated in response to the atypical
  cadherin Fat receptor activation through Ds binding. Signals are transduced through
  the FERM domain-containing cytoskeleton-associated protein, Merlin (Mer) and Expanded
  (Ex), and by Kibra, a protein that interacts with Mer and Ex. The Hippo kinase interacts
  with and phosphorylates the scaffold protein Sav promoting Hippo-mediated phosphorylation
  of the adaptor Mats and the Wts kinase. Wts is thereby activated and phosphorylates
  the transcriptional coactivator Yki. Phosphorylation of Yki induces its cytoplasmic
  retention through 14-3-3 binding. In the absence of Hippo pathway activation, Yki
  is mainly located in the nucleus, wherein it binds and activates various DNA biding
  transcription factors including Sd, Htx and Tsh to induce expression of genes implicated
  in cell growth and survival. B and C components of the Hippo pathway are highly
  conserved in mammals, wherein they have a critical role in proliferative control
  in the liver (mammalian orthologues are indicated with the same colour scheme as
  the corresponding Drosophila proteins). Although the circuitry is incompletely defined,
  it seems that two distinct models either in the oval cells or in hepatocytes can
  be proposed based on recent studies. In both cell types, inhibition of the Yki orthologue,
  Yap, is thought to be a critical output of the pathway. Defects upstream of Yap
  result in nuclear retention of Yap, which functions in association with DNA-binding
  transcription factors, for example, the TEAD domain transcription factors (orthologues
  of Sd) to regulate the expression of genes that control cell growth and survival.
  (B) In hepatocytes, Mst1/2 are required to phosphorylate Mob1. By analogy to Drosophila,
  phospho-Mob1 is likely to facilitate activation of an intermediary kinase, which
  phosphorylates Yap, resulting in both cytoplasmic retention by 14-3-3 binding, as
  well as cytoplasmic degradation after ubiquitinylation. Lats1/2 activity are unchanged
  by Mst1/2 inactivation suggesting the existence of a yet to be defined Mst1/2-regulated
  Yap kinase. The majority of the catalytically active Mst1/2 in the liver is in a
  truncated form that lacks the autoregulatory carboxy-terminus. The upstream activators
  of Mst1/2 are not defined, although Rassf family proteins, could link Mst1/2 to
  extracellular signals facilitating activation before the proteolytic cleavage. Sav1
  does not seem to have a role in Yap regulation in hepatocytes. (C) In oval cells,
  Sav1 controls total Yap protein levels and levels in the nucleus through yet to
  be defined mechanisms. The relationship of Sav1 to the Mst1/2 activation state and
  the phosphorylation of Yap is not clear, although the Mst1/2-controlled phosphorylation
  of Yap-Ser127 is unaffected by Sav1 inactivation. Mst1/2 have not been studied specifically
  in oval cells, however, the increase in oval cells following Mst1/2 inactivation
  indicate an important regulatory role for these kinases in oval cells. The components
  upstream of these pathways are incompletely defined, although cell–cell contact
  is likely to be an important stimulus.

  description: Hippo pathway circuitry in Drosophila and in the mammalian liver. (A)
    Model of Drosophila Hippo signaling. Signaling may be initiated in response to
    the atypical cadherin Fat receptor activation through Ds binding. Signals are
    transduced through the FERM domain-containing cytoskeleton-associated protein,
    Merlin (Mer) and Expanded (Ex), and by Kibra, a protein that interacts with Mer
    and Ex. The Hippo kinase interacts with and phosphorylates the scaffold protein
    Sav promoting Hippo-mediated phosphorylation of the adaptor Mats and the Wts kinase.
    Wts is thereby activated and phosphorylates the transcriptional coactivator Yki.
    Phosphorylation of Yki induces its cytoplasmic retention through 14-3-3 binding.
    In the absence of Hippo pathway activation, Yki is mainly located in the nucleus,
    wherein it binds and activates various DNA biding transcription factors including
    Sd, Htx and Tsh to induce expression of genes implicated in cell growth and survival.
    B and C components of the Hippo pathway are highly conserved in mammals, wherein
    they have a critical role in proliferative control in the liver (mammalian orthologues
    are indicated with the same colour scheme as the corresponding Drosophila proteins).
    Although the circuitry is incompletely defined, it seems that two distinct models
    either in the oval cells or in hepatocytes can be proposed based on recent studies.
    In both cell types, inhibition of the Yki orthologue, Yap, is thought to be a
    critical output of the pathway. Defects upstream of Yap result in nuclear retention
    of Yap, which functions in association with DNA-binding transcription factors,
    for example, the TEAD domain transcription factors (orthologues of Sd) to regulate
