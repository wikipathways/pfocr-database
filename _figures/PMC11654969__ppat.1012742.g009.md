caption: In the presence of CgUlp2, SUMO chains are removed from the target protein
  whereas, in its absence, polySUMOylated proteins are accumulated and targeted for
  protein degradation via STUbL, primarily CgUls1. This is a key contributor to the
  homeostasis of the target proteins. As more polySUMOylated protein accumulates in
  the absence of CgUlp2, in CgulsΔ, it is not degraded. The double mutant Cgulp2ΔCgslx8Δ
  exhibits an increased level of protein degradation possibly because of upregulated
  activity of CgUls1. Following MG132 treatment, degradation of proteins was prevented
  and SUMOylated proteins appeared in Cgulp2Δ and Cgulp2ΔCgslx8Δ mutants and so did
  the improved growth. Based on the experimental validation of quantitative mass spectrometry
  data, ubiquitin-proteosome pathway, purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway, and
  mitochondrial function were found to be significantly impacted in Cgulp2ΔCgslx8Δ
  double mutant. This was followed by the Cgulp2Δ single mutant. We propose that these
  are the primary causes of the increased protein loss and slow growth of Cgulp2ΔCgslx8Δ
  cells at 30°C. The ubiquitin-proteosome pathway components were decreased whereas
  purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway and mitochondrial proteins had increased
  in Cgulp2ΔCguls1Δ due to which restoration of growth and accumulation of polySUMOylated
  proteins was seen in this mutant compared to the Cgulp2Δ mutant
