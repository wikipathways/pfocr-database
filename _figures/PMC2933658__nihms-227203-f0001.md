caption: 'Simplified carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants (). Enzymatic reactions
  are represented by arrows, dashed lines represent multiple enzymatic steps. Substrates
  in red were evaluated in this study. Compounds: GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate;
  ABA, abscisic acid. Enzymes: PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; Z-ISO,
  15-cis zetacarotene isomerase; ZDS, zetacarotene desaturase; CRTISO, carotene isomerase;
  HYD, carotene hydroxylase enzymes, which include ε- and β-ring hydroxylases.'
