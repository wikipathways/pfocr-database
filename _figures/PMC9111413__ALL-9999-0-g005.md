caption: Eicosanoid pathways in viral infections and allergic inflammation of the
  respiratory airways are affected by several groups of medications. Eicosanoids are
  important immune mediators coordinating the inflammatory response to viral infections
  and allergen challenges between bronchial epithelial cells, airway‐resident and
  airway‐infiltrating immune cells. Several groups of drugs used in the treatment
  of allergic diseases and respiratory tract infections interfere with eicosanoid
  production and signaling pathways. Glucocorticoids (GCs) reduce the activity of
  phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and COX‐2, therefore restricting both the upstream substrate
  for eicosanoid production and subsequent enzyme. NSAIDs block COX‐1‐ and COX‐2‐mediated
  synthesis of prostaglandins by both bronchial epithelial cells and immune cells.
  This reduces tissue inflammation and alleviates the symptoms of infection, but at
  the same time affects the antiviral response. LTRAs block eicosanoid leukotriene
  signaling at the receptor level, reducing activation of granulocytes. Biologicals
  used in the treatment of allergic diseases (anti‐IL‐5, anti‐IL‐5Rα, anti‐IL‐4Rα,
  and anti‐IgE) interfere with the eicosanoid signaling in a non‐direct manner, by
  preventing undue activation of eosinophils and Th2 cells, as well as degranulation
  of basophils and mast cells. BAS—basophil; COX‐1—cyclooxygenase 1; CysLTs—cysteinyl
