caption: 'Regulation by zinc of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2
  signaling cascade.Zinc can activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway at various levels:
  (1) by inhibiting phosphatases that are involved in ERK1/2 dephosphorylation, and
  inhibits kinases that indirectly regulate the phosphorylation levels of receptors
  that subsequently activate the ERK cascade; (2) by directly binding to and activating
  receptors (e.g., G protein-coupled receptor 39) which have ERK1/2 as a downstream
  signaling cascade; (3) by activating MMPs, which subsequently cleave and activate
  substrates (e.g., pro-BDNF) releasing ligands (e.g., BDNF) that activate receptors
  upstream from the ERK1/2 cascade.MEK: Mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase;
  MMP: matrix metalloproteinases; BDNF: brain-derived neurotrophic factor.'
