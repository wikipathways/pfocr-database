caption: Effect of tetracyclines on the NF-κB transcription factor pathway. Minocycline
  (Min) and doxycycline (Dox) are capable of inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, acting
  on different points of this activation by inhibiting IκBα (IKK) activation, IκBα
  phosphorylation, degradation and p65, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, leading
  to a decreased pro-inflammatory immune response
