caption: CSCs are an important contributor to tumor chemoresistance because of their
  ability to survive platinum-based chemotherapies. Current platinum therapies target
  the bulk of non-CSC tumor cells, thus reducing tumor mass but leaving behind platinum-resistant
  CSCs. Accumulation of drug-resistant CSCs might explain why the vast majority of
  ovarian cancer patients relapse after chemotherapy and become increasingly platinum
  resistant. Consequently, successful tumor remission requires a dual combination
  therapy that targets and eliminates both CSCs and non-CSC tumor cells.
