caption: Hypothetical disease model of the role of the common epigenetic signature
  in repeat instability and disease phenotype. (A) Disease-causing nucleotide repeats
  typically have higher GC content, more CpG islands and more CTCF sites compared
  to non-disease-causing repeats in the genome. Typically, a TAD boundary will be
  present near disease-causing repeats. (B) Methylation near the nucleotide repeat
  results in increased repeat instability, potentially through a loss of CTCF binding,
  which is also associated with increased repeat instability. Additionally, the mismatch
  repair pathway, of which MSH2 and MSH3 are the main players at repeats, interacts
  with the hairpin structures formed at the repeat region and causes repeat instability.
  The close proximity of methylation and mismatch repair proteins to repeat regions
  could suggest that epigenetics and the mismatch repair machinery play a cooperative
  role regulating repeat instability.
