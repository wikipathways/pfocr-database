caption: Acupuncture holds promise for reducing brain injury of delayed thrombolysis
  by modulating astrocyte polarization and neuroinflammation. It suppresses inflammatory
  cytokine production and C3 expression, thereby alleviating neuroinflammation and
  preserving blood-brain barrier integrity. These effects are primarily driven by
  the inhibition of neurotoxic astrocyte polarization via the ERK1/2-Cx43 signaling
  pathway
