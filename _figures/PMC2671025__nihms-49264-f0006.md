caption: 'Adiponectin signaling and the regulation of mitochondrial function in skeletal
  muscleAdiponectin binding to its AdipoRs activates AMP-activated protein kinase
  (AMPK) and stimulates the phosphorylation of ACC2 and fatty-acid oxidation (Yamauchi
  et al., , ). Adiponectin also activates peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-α
  (PPARα) stimulating transcription of genes in the fatty-acid oxidation pathway and
  decreasing triglyceride content in muscle (Yamauchi et al., , ) and improving insulin
  sensitivity. Independent of changes in transcription and mitochondrial mass, the
  improvements in lipid oxidation occur in less than 6 hr (). Adiponectin activation
  of AMPK by upstream kinase AMPK kinase (AMPKK) activates transcription of myocyte
  enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferative activated
  receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1α), which in turn increases mitochondrial content,
  oxidative capacity, and oxidative-fiber type composition. Central to the development
  of mitochondrial dysfunction is reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which
  reacts with DNA, protein, and lipids leading to oxidative damage. ROS production
  is inversely related to mitochondrial content. Activation of the adiponectin pathway
  reduces the generation of ROS by two processes: (1) Increased mitochondrial content,
  which in turn decreases the workload for each mitochondrion leading to reduced membrane
  potential (←Δψ) and lower ROS production; and (2) adiponectin increases PGC1α activity
  which increases the transcription/activity of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 that decreases
  super oxide radical (O2 •-) ().'
