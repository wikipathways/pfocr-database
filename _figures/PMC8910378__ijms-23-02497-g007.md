caption: Schematic model depicting the FTs redundancy regulating flowering under LD
  condition. The FTs integrate the photoperiodic signal by photoperiod-dependent pathway.
  GmFT5a, GmFT2a, GmFT5b, and GmFT3b function as floral activators complex to redundantly
  transmit flowering information, and GmFT5a plays a decisive role in this complex.
  Floral activators overcome the effects of inhibitors to upregulate the downstream
  flowering-related genes and induce flowering. The sizes of boxes represent the effects
  of FTs in photoperiodic flowering. Arrow and bar-ended represent the promotion and
  inhibition effect, respectively. Dashed lines represent unverified regulatory mechanism.
