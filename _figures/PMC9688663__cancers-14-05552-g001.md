caption: 'Metabolic pathways in B-cell lymphoma. Imported glucose (GLC) is metabolized
  via glycolysis with multiple branching pathways utilizing glycolytic intermediates
  and pyruvate (PYR): glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) can be metabolized via the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) to ribose-5-phosphate (R5P); 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) can
  be used for serine (SER) and glycine (not shown) synthesis and contribute to one-carbon
  (1C) metabolism and the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines; glycolytic pyruvate
  can be converted to lactate (LAC) (while regenerating NAD+) and exported out of
  the cell or metabolized further in mitochondria and enter the tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle as acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA). Glutamine (GLUT) conversion to glutamate
  (GLU) is one of anaplerotic pathways that can feed the TCA cycle. These metabolic
  pathways are regulated at multiple levels and via several modes such as kinase signaling
  triggered by BCR activation (shown in orange) and transcription factor MYC (shown
  as yellow clouds). Other abbreviations used in the figure: Bruton tyrosine kinase
  (BTK), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), hexokinase (HK), phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PHGDH), serine hydroxymethyl transferase 1/2 (SHMT1/2), dihydrofolate reductase
  (DHFR), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), monocarboxylate transporter 1/4 (MCT1/4), lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), glutaminase 1 (GLS1), oxoglutarate
  dehydrogenase (OGDH), individual complexes comprising oxidative phosphorylation
