caption: 'Flux-independent signaling by NMDARs in neurons. (A) Agonist and co-agonist
  binding leads to the dephosphorylation of GluN1 Y837 and GluN2A Y842, resulting
  in clathrin-dependent internalization via the adaptor protein AP-2. High concentrations
  (10 µM) of glycine alone increase the interaction with AP-2, thereby priming NMDARs
  for dynamin-dependent endocytosis upon agonist binding. (B) Agonist and co-agonist
  binding to GluN1-containing NMDARs can stimulate the p38 MAPK in a flux-independent
  manner to promote AMPAR endocytosis, resulting in Ca2+-independent LTD induction.
  (C) Flux-independent signaling by NMDARs regulates spine morphology. In the presence
  of weak Ca2+ entry, NMDARs promote dendritic spine shrinkage by triggering a signaling
  pathway that requires interaction between nNOS and NOS1P, involving p38 MAPK, MK2,
  and cofilin, which promotes actin depolymerization. This signaling pathway is supported
  by mTORC1, which is likely to drive new protein synthesis. In the presence of strong
  Ca2+ influx (highlighted in red), the Ca2+-dependent recruitment of CaMKII leads
  to dendritic spine growth via inducing actin polymerization. (D) Flux-independent
  signaling by postsynaptic NMDARs regulates glutamate release by stimulating Src
  kinase to activate pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels, which clear synaptic anandamide
  (AEA) and prevent AEA-induced activation of presynaptic TRPV1 channels. This causes
  a reduction in [Ca2+]i at the presynaptic terminal and therefore decreases Ca2+-dependent
  glutamate release. By contrast, upon agonist and co-agonist binding, presynaptic
  NMDARs promote glutamate release via the JNK2-dependent signaling pathway. In all
  the panels, the red circle indicates the agonist, whereas the blue circle indicates
  the co-agonist. ↑: increase'
