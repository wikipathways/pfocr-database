caption: Integrated “-omics” analysis reveals global metabolic changes. (A) Cross-correlation
  analysis of identified proteins and metabolites from plasma samples. (B) PPI analysis
  of plasma proteomics findings. Note that PPAR pathway is now listed as one of the
  top pathways. Circular nodes represent the identified up- (red) and down-regulated
  (green) proteins, square nodes represent the KEGG pathway terms, and pentagonal
  nodes represent the identified metabolites. Solid or dashed grey lines between the
  molecules indicate the interaction with bigger and smaller confidence scores, respectively.
  (C) KEGG mapping tools were used to integrate the proteomics and metabolomics data
  sets into the human metabolic reference map (hsa01100). Red and blue represent up-
  and down-regulated, respectively. Lines represent reactions regulated by differentially
  expressed proteins and dots represent metabolites. Blue shading over lipid metabolism,
  galactose metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and energy metabolism serve to highlight
  pathways that are highly represented. PPI, protein-protein interaction; PPAR, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
