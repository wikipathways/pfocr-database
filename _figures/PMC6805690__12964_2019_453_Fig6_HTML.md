caption: Noise-induced bistability and resolution of fate dichotomies. a Integrated
  view of global network topology of Wnt/PI3K/Myc axis following integration of the
  Notch signaling pathway. b It is proposed that Notch signaling input combines enhanced
  autophagic flux with amplifications of translational noise in order to destabilize
  the existing cellular memory (i.e. destabilize thermodynamic stability) and to invoke
  bistability prior to biological decision-making. Resolution of such bistability
  requires integration of exogenous cues that amplify or terminate the Notch signalling
  pathway
