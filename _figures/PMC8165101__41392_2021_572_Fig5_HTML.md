caption: Canonical SMO-dependent hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway. Unliganded PTCH1
  prevents the ciliary translocation of SMO effector protein. GLI2 and GLI3 proteins
  are sequestered in the cytoplasm by SUFU and phosphorylated by protein kinases,
  thereby preventing HH target-gene transcription. HH ligands binding triggers endocytic
  internalization of PTCH1, which results in the accumulation and activation of SMO.
  Active SMO relieves SUFU-mediated inhibition of GLI2 and GLI3. Activator forms of
  GLI (GLI1A/GLI2A/GLI3A) translocate into the nucleus and initiate the transcription
  of target genes. Figure created with BioRender.com
