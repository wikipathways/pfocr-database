caption: 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is associated with GLUT1 overexpression
  and endometrial cancer therapies. HIF-1α is implicated in both GLUT1 expression
  and aberrant PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in tumor microenvironments. In addition
  to hypoxia, HIF-1α can be constitutively induced by oxygen-insensitive pathways,
  such as ubiquitination, acetylation, sumoylation, hydroxylation, and phosphorylation.
  These pathways jointly promote the expression of HIF-1α and further activate the
  downstream genes of GLUT1, including VEGF, EGF, and MMPs. 1) Radiotherapy: curcumin
  inhibits a site overlapping the cytochalasin B of GLUT1 and metabolism-related enzymes.
  OA decreases the expression of many significant factors, including GLUT1, HIF-1α,
  Ki67, and P53. GLUT1-siRNA interferes with the targeted gene, inhibiting the synthesis
  of GLUT1. ABHD 5 plays an oncogenic role in the development of EC, and its knockdown
  can notably suppress ECC proliferation and invasion in vivo. All of them can inhibit
  the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and activate autophagy of endometrial cancer cells (ECCs),
  increasing the sensitivity to radiotherapy. 2) Chemotherapy: olaparib inhibits the
  activity of GLUT1 in plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. BAY-876 can suppress
  cell viability and decrease stemness oncogene (Nanog and c-Myc) expression of ECCs.
  RSV inhibits GLUT1-induced glycolysis in a PI3K/AKT/mTOR-dependent manner, enhancing
  the anti-endometrial cancer (anti-EC) effects of cisplatin and doxorubicin. Curcumin
  inhibits a site overlapping the cytochalasin B of GLUT1 and metabolism-related enzymes.
  Vitamin C inhibits the expression of HIF-1α and GLUT1 in ECCs. 2-DG/19FDG and disulfiram
  show notably antiproliferative and anti-angiogenesis effects by downregulating the
  level of GLUT1. Targeting HtrA3 can enhance the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy
  via the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein cleavage. 3) Hormonal therapy: GLUT1
  participates in regulating PR of ECCs in a PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway-dependent manner.
  Flavones, phloretin, and metformin can greatly increase the sensitivity of hormonal
  therapy in EC by strengthening PR transcriptional activity. This figure was drawn
