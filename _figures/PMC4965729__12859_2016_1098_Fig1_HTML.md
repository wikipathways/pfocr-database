caption: Model of the sensorimotor control with time-delay estimation and sensory
  states predictor. The Plant Box symbolizes a higher level of a sensorimotor system
  such as the eye, associated muscles, sensors, responses, goals and objectives (e.g.,
  minimize retinal slip in VOR). The Controller Box is the neural network responsible
  for achieving the required task in an “optimal” way. Delay Estimator is the circuit
  we are proposing as the brain, or a sensorimotor systems to estimate time delay
  in a sensory and motor pathway. Sate Predictor is where current and “future” sensory
  states are estimated and predicted, respectively, based on the estimated current
  time delay. The “r(t)” is the desired goal, or in the language of control theory,
  the reference trajectory. The “e(t)” is the error difference between the desired
  sensory state and predicted sensory state . The “u(t)” are the motor commands to
  muscles or effector organs. The x(t − τ) are the delayed sensory states. The “x(t)”
  is the actual sensory state. Finally, “τ” is the time delay that could either be
  a natural time delay or a consequence of damage or disease
