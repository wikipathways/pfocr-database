caption: Functional investigation of lncRNAs. (A) lncRNA-gene co-expression network.
  Nodes were lncRNAs (triangles) and genes (circles). lncRNAs and genes were connected
  if they were significantly co-expressed. Red and blue lines represent positive and
  negative co-expressed associations, respectively. Different background color represents
  different pathways where the gene annotated. (B) p53 signaling pathway. Red marks
  represent the genes that were co-expressed with lncRNAs. lncRNA, long noncoding
  RNA.
