caption: 'Experimental hypothesis: CircALG1 relieves the inhibitory effect of miR-342-5p
  on PGF mRNA expression by competitively binding to miR-342-5p and promotes PGF expression
  to result in enhanced invasion of CRC. The high expression of METTL3 in CRC increased
  the m6A modification level of ALG1 pre-mRNA, and then increased the m6A modification
  level of cirALG1. The m6A modification of circALG1 enhances its ability to bind
  to miR-342-5p and promotes circALG1 ceRNA action by enhancing its stability'
