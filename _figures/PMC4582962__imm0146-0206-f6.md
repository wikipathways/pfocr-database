caption: 'Schematic illustrating the immune pathway of the contact sensitivity (CS)
  response with afferent and efferent nerves projecting to and from the brain. Central
  nervous system (CNS) regions found to be activated by the CS response and affected
  by capsaicin pre-treatment. Diagram (not to any scale) showing known and proposed
  connections involved in afferent (red lines) and efferent (blue lines) neural control
  of immunity. C-fibres (red) connected to dendritic cells in the skin (Hosoi et al.)5
  and also with free endings, possibly carrying Toll-like receptors (TLRs), take information
  about antigen challenge to the hypothalamus where it is processed by specific nuclei.
  Motor pathways have been mapped by Denes et al.23 from the insular and pyriform
  cortex, through the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), medulla and
  onward to the spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow. The control pathways to spleen
  and bone marrow are shown as dotted because these are not known to be activated
  in the CS response. Key: IC/PC, insular and pyriform cortex; CoA and CeA, cortical
  and central amygdala; MH, medial habenula; NTS, nucleus of the solitary tract; SG,
  sympathetic ganglia; DC, dendritic cell.'
