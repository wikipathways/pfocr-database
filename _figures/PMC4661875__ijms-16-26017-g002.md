caption: 'The Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways: The intrinsic, or mitochondrial,
  pathway is initiated from within the cell in response to DNA damage, loss of cell-survival
  factors and severe cell stress. Damaged mitochondria release proteins, such as SMAC
  (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase)/Diablo, which counteract the
  effect of IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), which normally bind and prevent
  activation of caspase-3. The extrinsic pathway begins outside the cell through activation
  of pro-apoptotic receptors on the cell surface. Ligand binding causes Death receptors
  to cluster and form a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). This complex activates
  caspase-8, which activates downstream caspases-3 and -7, committing the cell to
  apoptosis. Cellular stress induced apoptosis occurs by a mechanism that involves
  altering mitochondrial permeability and subsequent cytochrome c release and formation
  of the apoptosome, which activates caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 then cleaves caspase-3
  resulting in downstream events involved in cell death. Release of cytochrome c is
  regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins. The released cytochrome c binds to apoptotic
  protease activating factor-1 (APAF1) and activates caspase-9 [].'
