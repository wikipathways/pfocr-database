caption: Antioxidant effect of quercetin on enzyme activity, signal transduction pathways
  and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several conditions and environmental factors
  can increase ROS production. Besides, the mitochondrial electron transport chain
  is an important source of intracellular ROS generation. Flavonoid uptake occurs
  either via passive diffusion through cell membrane, or through membrane bound transport
  proteins []. After entering the cell, quercetin acts through the regulation of the
  enzyme-mediated antioxidant defense system and the non-enzymatic antioxidant defense
  system. Nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (NRF2), AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways induced by ROS
  to promote the antioxidant defense system and maintain oxidative balance can also
  be regulated by phenolic compounds such as quercetin []. Through the neutralizing
  effect of ROS, quercetin can develop important anti-inflammatory effect due to inhibition
  of the Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-KB) pathway, preventing the activation of NRLP3
  inflammasome (shown in B). Through the p53 pathway, ROS induce apoptotic events.
  Therefore, quercetin can prevent apoptosis induced by excess ROS. In addition, it
  enhances the production of Apurinic/apyrimidinic Endonuclease 1/ Redox Effector
  Factor 1 (APE1/Ref1), activation of various signaling events and the NF-E2-related
  factor (NRF2)-mediated activation of genes, containing antioxidant response elements
