caption: 'Akt2 facilitates cell cycle progression by regulating two separate pathways:
  (i) upregulation of Cdk2 and Cyclin D, and (ii) downregulation of p27 at the levels
  of transcription and protein stability through the upregulation of Skp2. In addition,
  Akt2 prevents abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis and pathological autophagy through
  the activation of p70S6K (i.e., phosphorylation at Thr389) and downregulation of
  PCG-1α. Broken lines and arrows are considered to be part of the pan-Akt pathway;
  however, our data suggests that Akt2 is not involved in the regulation of these
  signaling pathways. “×” denotes that these signaling pathways are not affected by
  Akt2 ablation. Solid lines are signaling pathways that have been confirmed by data
  presented in this paper. Arrows and “┴” denote up- and downregulation, respectively.
  ♦ denotes that this signal could cause abnormal mitochondrial biogenesis in the
  absence of Akt2.'
