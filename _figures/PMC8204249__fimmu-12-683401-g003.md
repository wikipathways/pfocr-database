caption: 'Signaling pathways activated by TNF receptors. (A) Bivalent cell-death regulating
  Complex I formed at plasma membrane by TNFR1 but not TNFR2. TNF receptors TNFR1
  (encoded by TNFSF1A) and TNFR2 (encoded by TNFSF1B) are homotrimeric receptors binding
  homotrimeric TNF ligand. TNFR1, unlike TNFR2, contains an intracellular “death domain”
  (DD), which binds homologous DDs on intracellular RIP1, FADD, and TRADD, to compose
  the core of Complex (I) RIP1 recruits the pro-apoptotic RIPK1 kinase, while TRADD
  recruits the anti-apoptotic TRAF adaptor protein family members, which are necessary
  for activation of NFκB and MAP kinase signaling downstream of TNFRs. TNFR2, which
  lacks a “death domain”, can recruit TRAFs directly, but with a lower binding affinity
  than Complex (I) TRAFs can recruit CIAP1 and CIAP2, anti-apoptotic proteins which
  form heterodimers (encoded by BIRC2 and BIRC3). (B) Mechanism of cell death inhibition
  by CIAPs at TNFRs. CIAPs are ubiquitin ligases, which polyubiquinate RIPK1, targeting
  it for degradation. CIAPs can be recruited intracellularly at TNF-bound TNFR1 or
  TNFR2. SMAC/DIABLO is an inhibitor of CIAPs: hence, SMAC/DIABLO mimetics (such as
  LCL-161 and birinapant) are pro-apoptotic. (C) Cell death pathways downstream of
  TNFR1. The uninhibited Complex I (with active RIPK1) promotes formation of the cytoplasmic
  death promoting Complexes IIa and IIb. Both complexes can activate cytoplasmic CASP8,
  the cleavage of which, to an active protease (cCASP8), initiates the apoptotic cascade.
  CASP8 activation can be inhibited by the long form of FLIP, encoded by the NFκB
  target gene CFLAR: a mechanism by which NFκB activation can promote cell survival.
  Complex IIb (containing RIPK3 as well as RIPK1) activates the kinase MLKL, which
  activates the necroptotic signaling cascade. (D) Activation of NFκB by TNFRs. TRAFs
  bound to TNFR1 or TNFR2 recruit TAK1, an essential activator of NFκB signaling.
  TAK1 activates the canonical NFκB pathway by recruiting the IKK complex, consisting
  of NEMO/IKKγ, IKK1, and IKK2. The IKK complex phosphorylates IκB family members,
  dissociating them from NFκB subunits and targeting them for degradation. NFκB, freed
  from IκB, is phosphorylated by both the IKK complex and casein kinase II (CK2),
  which in tandem activate NFκB subunits, which translocate to the nucleus to act
  as transcription factors. Bortezomib (directly) and pevonedistat (indirectly) inhibit
  IκB degradation. Among NFκB target genes are those encoding several cytokines and
  their receptors, as well as both antiapoptotic and pro-apoptotic components of the
  TNFR-NFκB signaling cascades.'
