caption: Schematic representation of CYP2E1-mediated ROS production by ethanol, followed
  by activation of PKCζ/JNK/SP1 pathway for the expression of CYP2E1 (red). Inhibitors
  that inhibit specific pathway of CYP2E1 expression are presented in blue. ARE, anti-oxidant
  response element; Nrf2, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2; SMAF, small molecule
  activation factor
