caption: The insulin signaling pathways were found to be significantly upregulated
  on the gene expression level using the program GenMAPP/MAPPFinder. Analysis criteria
  were set as described in the  section. Underneath each section of the pathway, genes
  found to have an increased expression are depicted in red, and genes found to have
  a decreased expression are depicted in green. Figure adapted from GenMAPP.
