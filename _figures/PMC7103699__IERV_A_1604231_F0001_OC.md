caption: 'Schematic representation to highlight the possible mechanism of action by
  which adjuvants exert their adjuvanticity. Adjuvants can serve as a depot that mediates
  recruitment of APCs or act as a delivery system to facilitate uptake of antigen
  by the APCs. Adjuvants may activate innate immune responses by signaling through
  cell surface CLRs (such as Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Mincle), cytosolic NLRs, cell surface
  TLRs, endosomal TLRs or cytosolic RIG-I and MDA5. Signaling via PRRs may lead to
  the activation of several transcription factors, which results in the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and type I IFNs. Secretion of chemokines
  due to adjuvants may also result in the recruitment and infiltration of more immune
  cells. Adjuvants can activate c-GAS that participates in the STING-mediated IRF3-type
  I IFN pathway. Adjuvants can enhance the expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules
  to mediate efficient presentation of antigen to naïve CD4+ T cells. Depending upon
  the class of adjuvant, cellular (Th1) and/or humoral (Th2) immune responses may
  be induced. Adjuvants also play important roles in GC reaction, affinity maturation
  and long-lived memory responses as a part of humoral immunity.APC: antigen presenting
