caption: Highly glycolytic cancer cells exhibiting a Warburg phenotype ferment large
  amounts of glucose into lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon
  allows rapid ATP production and provides precursors for biosynthetic processes promoting
  cell proliferation. By alleviating PDH inhibition by PDK, DCA fosters the conversion
  of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and activates mitochondrial respiration. The consequent
  allosteric inhibition of glycolysis by ATP reduces glucose consumption and glycolytic
  intermediates levels, thereby decreasing the flux of the pentose phosphate pathway
  along with cellular proliferation. PDH, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase. PDK, Pyruvate Dehydrogenase
  Kinase. G6P, Glucose-6-phosphate. NAD, Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide. NADP,
  Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate. Glut, Glucose Transporter. MCT4, Monocarboxylate
  Transporter 4.
