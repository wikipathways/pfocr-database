caption: (A) The role of JA in plant–virus interactions. Geminivirus C2 binds to CSN5
  and affects the activity of SCFs, thus suppressing the JA response to viral infection
  []; RRSV and SRBSDV infection induces miR319, which reduces the function of TCP21
  and consequently suppressing JA-mediated defense to facilitate virus infection and
  symptom development []; The RSV CP increases the JA level, resulting in the degradation
  of JAZ proteins and the release of JAMYB. JAMYB binds to and activates the AGO18
  promoter, enhancing host antiviral defense by sequestering miR168 and miR528 and
  releasing AGO1 and ROS []. RSV infection also inhibits the BR signaling pathway
  and increases the accumulation of OsGSK2, which interacts with and phosphorylates
  OsMYC2 for degradation and therefore reduces JA-mediated RSV resistance []. (B)
  The role of auxin in plant–virus interactions. The TMV 126 kDa protein interacts
  with IAA26 and disrupts its localization, thus regulating auxin response during
  disease development []; The RDV P2 protein disrupts auxin signaling by interacting
  with OsIAA10, thus causing infected plants to display typical viral symptoms [];
  RSV P2 and RBSDV SP8 target OsARF17 and disrupt its dimerization and DNA binding
  activity, thus manipulating auxin signaling to facilitate infection []. AGO18, ARGONAUTE
