caption: GABBR1/ACHE regulation. (A) In the presence of GABBR1 variant. The autism-associated
  GABBR1 variant may affect levels of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) in the synaptic
  cleft by decreasing either total levels of GABBR1 expression and/or function of
  its gene product, the GABAB1 receptor. Under this condition, the cascade that normally
  downregulates acetylcholinesterase expression may be suppressed. Because of that,
  larger amounts of the enzyme are produced, and the acetylcholine degrades at an
  elevated rate, resulting in less acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and less signaling
  through the cholinergic receptor. (B) In the presence of GABBR1 variant and a dietary
  choline deficiency. When choline levels are deficient, less acetylcholine (ACh)
  is available in the neurons for signaling, and a decrease in cholinergic binding/signaling
  attributed to GABBR1 variant would be exacerbated.
