caption: (A) Comparison of the down-regulated (green) and up-regulated (pink) pathways
  between metacyclic trypomastigotes and cell derived trypomastigotes. Comparison
  of the down-regulated (blue) and up-regulated (orange) pathways between metacyclic
  trypomastigotes and epimastigotes. Comparison of the down-regulated (yellow) and
  up-regulated (red) pathways between metacyclic trypomastigotes and amastigotes.
  (B) Table of down- and up-regulated genes between metacyclic trypomastigotes and
  amastigotes, cell derived trypomastigotes, epimastigotes. The pathway annotation
  pipeline using KAAS for KEGG pathway assignments was used to reconstruct the pathways
  and was modified to include down-regulated and up-regulated genes (Kanehisa & Goto,
  2000).
