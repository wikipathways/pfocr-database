caption: Proposed model of the pathway that controls germ cell proliferation during
  L1 diapause. MDF-1 causes the starvation-induced cell-cycle arrest of PGCs by inhibiting
  the activity of the APC/CCDC20. MDF-1 is a downstream target of AKT-1. Phosphorylation
  of MDF-1 by AKT-1 reduces MDF-1's ability to bind MDF-2. DAF-18 indirectly activates
  MDF-1 by negatively regulating the AGE-1–AKT-1 signalling pathway. MDF-1–FZY-1 may
  not be the sole downstream factor of this pathway; another as yet unknown AKT-1
  target may also regulate germ cell proliferation.
