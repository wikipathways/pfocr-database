caption: 'Common intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways induced by anticancer
  drugs. In the intrinsic pathway, anticancer drugs activate JNK via mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase (MKK)4/7, which phosphorylates the 14-3-3 protein, dissociates
  Bax, and activates Bak. Bax and Bak translocate to the mitochondrial outer membrane
  and release Cyt c. Cyt c then forms apoptosomes containing apoptotic protease activating
  factor 1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase-9, activating the caspase cascade that leads to
  apoptotic cell death. JNK phosphorylates Bid (jBid) and migrates through the mitochondria
  to release second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac)/high temperature
  requirement A2 (HtrA2), which inhibits the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
  (XIAP) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (c-IAP), resulting in the activation
  of caspase-8 and the caspase cascade. JNK also phosphorylates B-cell lymphoma 2
  (Bcl-2) and inhibits its function. In the extrinsic pathway, anticancer drugs activate
  death receptors that recruit the Fas-associated death domain (FADD), tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), and procaspase-8 to form
  a death-induced signaling complex, which in turn activates caspase-8. Caspase-8
  cleaves, generating truncated Bid (tBid), which translocates to the mitochondria,
  releasing proapoptotic proteins such as Cyt c and Smac/HrtA2. JNK activates c-Jun/activator
  protein 1 (AP-1), which induces apoptosis-promoting genes such as Bak, TNF-α, and
  Fas L, in turn activating the caspase cascade leading to apoptotic cell death. Abbreviation:
