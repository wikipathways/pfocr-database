caption: 'Possible mechanisms by which phosphorylation of PAGE4 at T51 could potentiate
  the transactivation of c-Jun but weaken its affinity for c-Jun. (A) By binding to
  c-Jun in its nonphosphorylated form, PAGE4 may preclude c-Jun from interacting with
  an unidentified partner (Factor X) that is critical for its activation of target
  genes. However, upon phosphorylation, PAGE4 dissociates itself or fails to associate
  with c-Jun and binds to Factor X, and the PAGE4/Factor-X complex can now interact
  with c-Jun and potentiate its transactivation of the relevant target genes. (B)
  Alternatively, upon phosphorylation, PAGE4 can dissociate or fail to associate itself
  with c-Jun and thereby facilitate a direct interaction between Factor-X and c-Jun
  to promote the transactivation of target genes. (C) It is also possible that phosphorylated
  PAGE4 facilitates the synthesis of Factor-X, which then interacts with c-Jun to
  facilitate the activation of c-Jun targets. TXN: transcription apparatus.'
