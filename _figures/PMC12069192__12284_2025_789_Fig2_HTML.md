caption: The regulation mechanisms of LMM proteins in rice. The proteins in blue are
  involved in transcription and protein translation; the proteins in red are involved
  in ubiquitin–proteasome pathway; the proteins in yellow are involved in protein
  phosphorylation; the proteins in orange are involved in vesicle trafficking; the
  proteins in green are involved in metabolic pathway; the proteins in purple are
  involved in other regulation pathway; the proteins in indigo blue are involved in
  phytohormone signaling; the proteins in pink represent the interaction factors of
  the LMM proteins. Proteins represented by dashed lines indicate those with unclear
  subcellular localization, whereas proteins represented by solid lines indicate those
  with clear subcellular localization. The dashed arrows indicate that the regulatory
  pathway is unclear. PES, Peroxisomes; MVB, multivesicular bodies; PPB, porphobilinogen;
  HYMB, hydroxymethylbilane; ABAld, abscisyl aldehyde; RCC, red chlorophyll catabolite;
  pFCC, primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolite; Xoc, X. oryzae pv. Oryzicola
