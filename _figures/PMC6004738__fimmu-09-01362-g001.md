caption: 'Age-dependent changes in innate immune pathways in Drosophila glial cells:
  immune deficiency (IMD) pathway (on the left) shows age-dependent activation resulting
  in increased levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in middle and old-aged adults
  in absence of microbial challenge. Mutations in genes encoding specific IMD negative
  regulators namely Dnr1, trabid, Transglutaminase (Tg,) and pirk release the pathway
  allowing activation of Relish and subsequent transcription of downstream genes including
  those encoding AMPs. Aging also affects expression of the phagocytic receptor Draper
  (on the right) leading to inefficient phagocytic capacity of glial cells. Draper
  expression levels in the healthy brain are regulated via phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  signaling activity that mediates TOR-dependent translation of draper mRNA in glial
  cells. Age related decline in the activity of this signaling cascade leads to reduction
  in protein levels of Draper in glia.'
