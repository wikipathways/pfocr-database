caption: Cooperative mechanisms among receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP)-based
  and neurexin-based synapse organizing complexes. (A) Netrin-G ligand-3 (NGL-3) and
  the neurotrophin receptor TrkC bind to distinct domains of PTPσ [the first two fibronectin
  III (FNIII) domains for NGL-3 [] and the Ig domains for TrkC []]. Therefore, NGL-3
  and TrkC could cooperatively regulate excitatory synapse organization through possible
  simultaneous binding to PTPσ. Although domain mapping has not been reported for
  the other RPTP partners, their regulation by meA and meB splicing suggests that
  interleukin-1-receptor accessory protein-like 1 (IL1RAPL1) and interleukin-1 receptor
  accessory protein (IL1RAcP) also bind to the Ig domains. Thus, NGL-3, which can
  bind to all RPTPs, might be rather unique in simultaneously binding to RPTPs along
  with a variety of other postsynaptic partners. (B) NGL-3 and IL1RAPL1 can each bind
  to the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95 [,], and neuroligins bind to the third PDZ
  domain of PSD-95 ([]). Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs) also
  bind PSD-95 [], Thus, scaffolding by PSD-95, which itself forms head-to-head multimers,
  and other members of the MAGUK family, may stabilize many of these trans-synaptic
  complexes and function to transduce the anterograde synapse organizing signal by
  recruiting postsynaptic receptors, other scaffolds, and signaling proteins. (C)
  The most direct known link from RPTPs to neurexins is through liprin-α binding to
  CASK, which in turn binds to neurexins []. However, cultured cortical neurons lacking
  CASK exhibit normal evoked glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission [] and Caenorhabditis
  elegans liprin-α and CASK orthologs Syd-2 and Lin-2 do not colocalize or genetically
  interact [], raising questions about the importance of this link. Another key pathway
  recently identified in Drosophila [] links the neurexin DNrx-1 to the liprin-α DSyd-2
  through DSyd-1, a Rho GTPase-activating protein that contains PDZ and C2 domains
  initially identified from a C. elegans screen for genes contributing to synapse
  development []. It is not yet clear whether Syd-1 directly binds liprin-α or whether
  they interact through simultaneous binding to ERC [].
