caption: A schematic representation of cytosolic RNA and DNA-induced type I IFN signaling
  pathway and its regulators. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize different groups of viral RNAs
  and initiate signaling cascades that begin with prion-like polymerization of MAVS.
  MAVS recruits and activates TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Polyubiquitin chains
  on these ligases are sensed by NEMO through its ubiquitin-binding domains, in turn,
  recruiting IKK and TBK1 complexes to phosphorylate IκBα and IRF3, respectively.
  LGP2 may function as a regulator to modulate the activity of RIG-I and MDA5. Viral
  DNA could activate cGAS and other DNA sensors, which are all proposed to transduce
  signals to the ER-localized adaptor protein STING. STING triggers TBK1‑dependent
  type I IFN response. RNA polymerase III transcribes the DNA into 5'ppp-RNA, which
  triggers the RIG-I pathway. Most of the key molecules involved in the RNA- and DNA-sensing
  pathways can be targeted by E3 ligases, deubiquitinases or regulatory NLRs, which
  negatively (red blunt arrow) or positively (green arrow) regulate type I IFN responses.
