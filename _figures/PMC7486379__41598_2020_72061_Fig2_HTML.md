caption: Genome-wide overview of pathway enrichment analysis Enriched pathways are
  highlighted in yellow. Out of the 27 shown hierarchical clusters, 16 clusters had
  enriched pathways. Immune system, signal transduction, programmed cell death, developmental
  biology, gene expression, disease and extracellular matrix organization pathways
  cluster were the most enriched with numerous pathways.
