caption: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKi) block the activity of cytokines. (A)
  Greater than 50 cytokines signal via the JAK-signal transducer and activator of
  transcription proteins (STAT) pathway and rely entirely on the kinase activity of
  JAK proteins to transmit their signals. JAK inhibitors block the activity of activated
  JAK proteins downstream of cytokine receptor signaling and thus prevent downstream
  activation of STAT proteins. (B) JAK inhibitors are oral medications dosed 1 to
  2 times per day. The levels of drug in the plasma fluctuate throughout the day.
  During peak plasma levels a portion, but not all, of a particular cytokine's activity
  is inhibited. In practice, in this therapeutic range, pathologically elevated cytokine
  activity is targeted while normal cytokine function is relatively spared. Throughout
  the day, the plasma concentration is also frequently subtherapeutic. The specific
  range varies for individual cytokines and the specificity of the JAK inhibitor.
  Upon cessation of the drug, the effect dissipates rapidly.
