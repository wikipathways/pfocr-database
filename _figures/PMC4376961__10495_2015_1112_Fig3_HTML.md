caption: 'A schematic overview of autophagy machinery and its regulation by sphingolipids.
  A  Autophagy induction and nucleation of phagophore membranes (pre-autophagosomal
  structures): in nutrient rich conditions (insulin, growth factors and amino acids),
  the mTORC1 kinase associates with the ULK1 complex to inhibit the initiation of
  autophagy. However, under growth factor deprivation or nutrient starvation, energy
  sensor AMPK activates the ULK1 complex by directly phosphorylating ULK1 and by suppression
  of mTORC1 activity through phosphorylation, and initiates vesicle nucleation. Phosphorylated
  and active ULK1 also promotes phosphorylation of Atg13 and FIP200, and dissociates
  from mTORC1. PI3K-III and VPS34 together with ATG14, AMBRA1, VPS15, and Beclin-1
  form a protein complex (PI3K-III complex) and initiates phagophore formation. Autophagosome
  formation and maturation: Two ubiquitin-like proteins, Atg12 and LC3, are involved
  in double-membrane vesicle (autophagosome) formation, elongation, and closure. Atg12
  is conjugated with Atg5 by Atg7 and Atg10, which then form a complex with Atg16.
  This complex works with Atg7 and Atg3 to conjugate LC3-I with the polar head of
  phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to produce LC3-II, which is specifically located on
  autophagosome structures. Autophagosomes are sequentially fused with lysosomes to
  form autolysosomes. In the autolysosome, the autophagosomal cargoes are digested
  by lysosomal hydrolases and the contents are released for metabolic recycling. B
  Sphingolipids have direct effects on different stages of the autophagy pathway.
  At the initial step, ceramide may stimulate autophagy via PI3K-1/Akt activation
  which suppresses the inhibitory effects of mTORC1 on autophagy. Acid sphingomyelinase-derived
  ceramide also increases autophagy via reducing mTORC1 activity during amino acid
  deprivation in a PP2A-dependent manner. C2-ceramide-induced decrease of mitochondrial
  membrane potential upregulates BNIP3 expression which ultimately leads to induction
  of autophagy through dissociation of Beclin-1 from Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 in a
  competitive manner. Similarly, ceramide-mediated activation of JNK disrupts the
  inhibitory Beclin-1:Bcl-2 complex through direct phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Furthermore,
  ceramide-mediated activation of transcription factor c-Jun may increase autophagy
  activation via upregulation of Beclin-1 and LC3 expression. Ceramide may also activate
  calpain which subsequently cleaves Atg5 to generate a protein fragment that leads
  to suppression of autophagy and apoptosis induction. Mitochondrial ceramide has
  been shown to mediate mitophagy through the direct interaction between ceramide
  and LC3-II'
