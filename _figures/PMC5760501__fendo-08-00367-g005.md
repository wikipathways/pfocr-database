caption: Pathways in the reproductive axis and the critical leptin targets that must
  be activated for reproductive competence. The pathway in green is proposed based
  on the evidence that leptin stimulates activin mRNA (Figure ) and that activin mRNA
  is reduced in leptin receptor (LEPR)-null gonadotropes (). It is also based on evidence
  that restoration of LEPR in LEPR-null gonadotropes results in elevated follicle-stimulating
  hormone (FSH) () as activin is important for FSH synthesis. We propose that this
  well-established FSH-driven pathway provides the stimulation to the follicle that
  results in a rise in estradiol needed early in the cycle to promote responses from
  GnRH neurons and gonadotropes. The red pathway is focused on the well-established
  circuitry in which leptin regulates LEPR-target neurons in the hypothalamus to stimulate
  GnRH neurons. It is based on evidence from key studies showing that restoration
  of LEPR in the PMV improves fertility (, ). The pathway shows that GnRH pulses are
  needed for transcription of Gnrhr mRNA as well as transcription and translation
  of LH and FSH. The blue pathway is based on our recent studies showing that mice
  lacking LEPR in gonadotropes are subfertile () or infertile (Figure ; Table ) and
  have significantly reduced gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) proteins,
  but not mRNA levels (). We hypothesize that leptin plays a direct post-transcriptional
  role in de-repressing mRNA translation by inhibiting miRNAs and/or MSI1, which then
  allows activation of Gnrhr mRNA translation.
