caption: Force on E-cadherin triggers the recruitment LKB1 and the subsequent activation
  of AMPK. Activate AMPK has two effects. First, it stimulates a signal transduction
  cascade that includes Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Y822 vinculin (yellow circle)
  and the subsequent activation of a RhoA-ROCK-MLCK pathway that leads to increased
  MLC phosphorylation and elevated contractility. Second, AMPK stimulates glucose
  uptake and oxidation to ATP to provide energy to allow the actin cytoskeleton to
  reorganized. Both signaling events are necessary for cell stiffening. LKB1=liver
  kinase B1; AMPK=AMP- activated protein kinase; Abl=Abelson tyrosine kinase; ROCK=Rho
  associated protein kinase; MLCK=myosin light chain kinase; MLC=myosin light chain.
