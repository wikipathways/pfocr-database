caption: 'Schematic overview of the GUN1-dependent coordination of plastid and nuclear
  transcriptional machinery in three different scenarios: early stages of chloroplast
  development (a), altered protein homeostasis (b) and altered protein homeostasis
  in the absence of GUN1 protein (c). The role of GUN1 becomes evident when chloroplast
  biogenesis is altered either by chemical treatments (lincomycin of norflurazon)
  or genetic defects that impair plastid protein homeostasis (see panels indicated
  as altered proteostasis) [,,]. Under these conditions, GUN1 has been reported to
  (i) interact with NEP and favour accumulation of NEP-dependent transcripts, including
  ycf1 that encodes the Tic214 subunit of the protein translocon at the inner envelope
  membrane of chloroplasts []; (ii) interact with MORF2, a component of the Editosome
  protein complex, and edit NEP-dependent transcripts, including rpoB and rpoC1, but
  also rps12, rps14, ndhB and ndhD mRNAs []; (iii) interact with cpHSC70-1 and regulate
  plastid protein import (this detail is not shown) []. Overaccumulation of preproteins
  in the cytosol of gun1 cotyledon cells induces the accumulation of cytosolic HSP90
  proteins that favour PhANGs transcription [,]. This could be obtained by either
  26S proteasome-dependent degradation of negative transcriptional regulators or activation,
  through HSP90-promoting folding, of positive ones (transcription factors, TFs).
  It is conceivable that a similar mechanism could be active even at early stages
  of chloroplast development [], to fine-tune the chloroplast and nuclear transcription
  machineries with respect to the developmental needs. However, under these conditions
  the accumulation of preproteins and downstream components of the signalling pathway
  have not been described yet. Note that the thickness and brightness of lines and
  shapes is directly proportional to the activity of the specific process. cTP, chloroplast
  transite peptide; TOC, translocon at the outer chloroplast membrane; TIC, translocon

  and translation rate of plastid-encoded genes.'
