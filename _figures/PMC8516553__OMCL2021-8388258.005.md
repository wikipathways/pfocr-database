caption: The transduction mechanism of the OS-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  in OC. (a) In the absence of the Wnt ligand, the level of intracellular β-catenin
  is controlled by a “destruction complex” formed by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β),
  casein kinase 1 (CK1), adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and AXIN (a cytoplasmic
  protein regulating G-protein signaling) []. The destruction complex ubiquitinates
  and degrades β-catenin, thus preventing it from entering the nucleus to bind to
  the TCF/LEF complex and activate its target genes [, ]. ROS phosphorylate and inactivate
  GSK3β by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and thus inhibiting GSK3β's ability to
  degrade β-catenin [, ]. (b) In the presence of the Wnt ligand, the ligand binds
  to the cell surface receptor encompassing frizzled (FZD) and low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6), leading to their conformational changes [].
  Disheveled (DVL) is then recruited and phosphorylated by FZD. Phosphorylated DVL
  in turn recruits AXIN, which inactivates the destruction complex and promotes the
  accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol []. Subsequently, β-catenin is translocated
  into the nucleus where it displaces Groucho and binds to TCF/LEF members. Together
  with coactivators, the transcription of downstream target genes is initiated [].
  ROS can upregulate the Wnt pathway by oxidizing and inactivating nucleoredoxin,
  which inhibits DVL [].
