caption: 'Outline of HIV-1 env RNA metabolism. Following synthesis, the US/UC form
  of env RNA has two potential fates: (1) undergoing cleavage and polyadenylation
  to generate the US/C form or (2) being spliced to produce S/UC RNA. The ESS3 acts
  at this stage to block both processing events. In contrast, Sam68 selectively promotes
  the formation of the US/C form of env RNA. Once generated, the S/UC RNA can be further
  processed by 3′ end cleavage/ polyadenylation to generate S/C RNA that is subsequently
  transported to the cytoplasm in a Rev-independent fashion. The US/C RNA has two
  possible fates: (1) undergoing splicing to generate S/C RNA or (2) interacting with
  Rev and being transported into the cytoplasm through the Crm-1 pathway. Indicated
  are the identities of the various RNAs observed; unspliced, uncleaved (US/UC); unspliced,
  cleaved (US/C); spliced, uncleaved (S/UC); spliced, cleaved (S/C).'
