caption: A model proposed for the responses of Puccinellia nuttalliana to NaCl based
  on root transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. NaCl is sensed by the salt sensors
  which triggers cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation in the cytosol. Ca2+ activates SOS3 leading
  to the formation of SOS3-SOS2 complex. This complex triggers the activation of downstream
  SOS1. Salt stress induces the activation of NaCl-responsive TFs, important regulators
  of salt responsive genes. TIPs are down-regulated to slow down water efflux from
  vacuoles. PIP2;2 is up-regulated to lower resistance of plasma membrane to water
  influx into the cytoplasm and transport of Na+ ions. Several antiporters, NHX, HKT,
  SOS1, PIP2;2, AKT, HAK, CNGG, and NSCC are differentially expressed to facilitate
  intra- and intercellular K+ and Na+ homeostasis in Puccinellia nuttalliana under
  salt stress. Na+ transport across the plasma membrane driven by the H+ gradient
  occurred by plant proton pumps, H+-ATPase and V-ATPase. Na+ is sensed by sensors
  leading to the enhanced accumulation of ROS. The function of proline accumulation
  under salt stress is to provide osmotic adjustment and scavenging of ROS. Dopamine
  improves the antioxidant capacity by scavenging ROS, regulate the expression of
  SOS1 and activating Ca2+signaling pathway. Phosphatidychlines increased for membrane
  lipid remodeling to regulate fluid and ion permeability and maintain membrane integrity
  under saline environment. Salt stress elevates the level of PA, a direct activator
  of MPK6. MPK6 e is involved in regulating ethylene biosynthesis and phosphorylation
  of SOS1. Amino Acid Permease3 (AAP3) plays a potential role in the uptake and distribution
  of amino acids. L-Proline transport through plasma membrane is achieved L-proline
  transporter (ProT2). SOS—salt overly sensitive, PIP-Plasma membrane intrinsic protein,
  NHX—sodium/proton antiporters, PM-ATPase—plasma membrane ATPase, V-ATPase—vacuolar
