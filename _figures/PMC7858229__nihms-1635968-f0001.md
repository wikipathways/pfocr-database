caption: a) Necroptosis is activated through engagement of death receptors for TNFα,
  Fas-L, and TRAIL. At the membrane, TNFα receptor engagement triggers the assembly
  of Complex I. Within this complex, RIPK1 is regulated by ubiquitination and phosphorylation.
  When RIPK1 is deubiquitinated, it dissociates from Complex I and translocates to
  the cytosol. Additional factors are recruited to assemble Complex IIa or Complex
  IIb/ripoptosome. Complex IIa forms when cells are treated with cycloheximide or
  when NF-κB signaling is inhibited, promotes RIPK1-independent apoptosis when caspase-8
  is active, and is inhibited by cFLIP. Complex IIb/ripoptosome forms when cIAP1/2
  are deleted or inhibited. When caspase-8 is active, this complex promotes RIPK1-dependent
  apoptosis. Conversely, when caspase-8 is deleted or inhibited by cFLIP, this complex
  promotes necroptosis. Inactivation of caspase-8 allows for RIPK1 to associate with
  RIPK3 to form the necrosome, where autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation
  events activate RIPK1 and RIPK3. Activated RIPK3 binds to and phosphorylates MLKL,
  driving its oligomerization. Oligomerized MLKL forms pores in the plasma membrane,
  allowing for the release of inflammatory mediators. b) Receptor binding or intracellular
  recognition of PAMPs and DAMPs leads to activation of various inflammasomes, depending
  on the danger stimuli. Inflammasome activation leads to the cleavage of caspase-1,
  which can then cleave GSMD. Non-canonical inflammasome activation involves activation
  of caspases-4 and −5 (or the murine homolog caspase-11) which can cleave GSDMD.
  GSDMD oligomerizes and forms pores in the plasma membrane, allowing for the release
  of inflammatory mediators. Alternatively, death receptor engagement leads to the
  activation of the apoptosis pathway, leading to caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation.
  Caspase-3 can cleave GSDME, which oligomerizes and forms pores in the plasma membrane
  to allow for the release of inflammatory mediators. GSDMD and GSDME also form pores
  in the mitochondria, which can amplify the cell death pathway.
