caption: Consequence of FA defects. The FA pathway serves during the DNA damaging
  sensing/signaling, DNA damage repair, and eliminating ROS by cooperating with various
  interactors, such as ATM/ATR, Foxo3a/STAT1, separately. Mutations of FA complementation
  groups lead to the FA phenotypes such as congenital abnormalities, cancer, and bone
  marrow failure.
