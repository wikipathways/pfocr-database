caption: A schematic illustration of the role of various noncoding-RNAs in modulating
  the JAK2/STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathway as major regulators of T cell function.
  a) In JAK/STAT pathway, JAKs bind to the receptor, and upon multimerization, upregulation
  of JAK proteins is mediated via trans-phosphorylation. Consequently, JAKs have a
  significant part in STATs phosphorylation. After dimerization of STATs, they translocate
  to the nucleus, where they either activate or suppress several target genes. This
  cascade is remarkably involved in the control of immune responses. Dysregulation
  of JAK-STAT signaling is associated with different immune disorders (, ). Besides,
  REG3A, acts as a key molecule for overexpression of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway which
  effectively contributes to triggering inflammation (). b) The NF-kB canonical or
  classical signaling pathway is initiated from the cell surface receptor of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and PAMPs containing TNFR, TLR and T/B cell receptor. The activation of
  IKK complex is triggered via binding of ligand molecules to transfer the signal
  across the cell surface. This complex generally comprises heterodimer of IKKα and
  IKKβ catalytic subunits and an IKKγ regulatory subunit. The released NF-kB dimers
  (most generally the p50–P65 dimer) could be translocated to the nucleus, and bind
  to DNA to trigger activation of the down-stream gene transcription (–). In addition,
  NF-κB signaling cascade could be regulated via TNFAIP3 through deubiquitinating
  TNFR1-RIP1, IL-1R/TLR4-TRAF6, and NOD2-RIP2 pathways (). Moreover, canonical NF-kB
  cascade could be activated by various members of the TNFRSF including GITR, TNFR2,
  4-1BB, and DR3 but not OX40 in Treg cells and modulates induction of Foxp3, markers
  of Th2/Th17 response (). Mounting studies have revealed that multiple ncRNAs (lncRNAs
  and miRNAs) have an effective role in as major regulators of T cell function through
  regulating the JAK/STAT and NF-κB cascades. As an illustration, recent research
  has detected that downregulation of miR-128-3p could notably reduce the inflammation
  response of rheumatoid arthritis via attenuating the activity of NF-κB pathway and
  promote expression of TNFAIP3 (). Another study has figured out that reducing the
  expression of lncRNA NEAT1 could lead to suppression of Th17/CD4+ T cell differentiation
  via downregulating STAT3 expression in rheumatoid arthritis patients (). Furthermore,
  upregulation of DQ786243 could play a remarkable role in elevating the expression
  level of miR-146a through modulating Foxp3, and thereby suppressing the NF-κB signaling
  cascade in oral lichen planus disease (). Green arrows indicate upregulation of
  target genes modulated via ncRNAs (lncRNAs, and miRNAs), red arrows depict inhibition
  by these ncRNAs. All the information regarding the role of these ncRNAs in modulating
  T call differentiation can be seen in , .
