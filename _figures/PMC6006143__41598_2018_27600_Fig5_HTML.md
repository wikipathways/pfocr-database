caption: Primary metabolic pathway representing distinctive metabolic dys-regulation
  among GO, GD, and healthy control. Pathway is manually re-organized for visual clarification
  and better explanatory overview on based on metabolites that are present at different
  concentrations and mappable into central carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Metabolite
  labeled with red color shows different levels of concentration both in GC and GO
  compared to healthy controls. Metabolite labeled with blue color presents exclusive
  difference in metabolites contents between GO and the healthy control whereas green
  color shows the significantly different abundance only in GD compared to healthy
  controls (p < 0.1). The relative concentrations are present as box-and-whisker plot
  indicating 1 × S.E. and 1.96 × S.E., respectively.
