caption: 'Regulatory programs for plasticity and functional polarization in helper
  lymphocytes. (a) Scheme for functional polarization within adaptive, innate, and
  innate-like helper lymphocytes. Upon activation, naive and progenitor lymphocytes
  (Th0, ILCp, or NKTp) will proceed along a polarization pathway based upon the type
  of infection and microenvironmental cues. Type 1, 2, and 3 immune cells are polarized
  in response to intracellular bacteria or viruses, helminths, and extracellular bacteria
  or fungi, respectively. Based upon danger signals and pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns, antigen-presenting cells release soluble cytokines (on top of cells) that
  activate JAK/STAT signaling through the relevant cytokine receptors. This is followed
  by activation of an LDTF by STAT, as shown, which drives initial stages of polarization.
  Signature TFs and cytokines for the three functional phenotypes are shown. (b) ILC3
  plasticity. Indicated are cell types, transcription factors (inside cells), and
  soluble cytokines (outside cells) thought to be important for stepwise conversion
  of ILC3s to ILC1s. External signals that drive conversion events are indicated above
  the arrows. Abbreviations: ILC1, group 1 innate lymphoid cell; ILCp, ILC progenitor;
  LDTF, lineage-determining transcription factor; NKT, natural killer T; NKTp, NKT
  progenitor; Th, T helper; Th0, naive Th.'
