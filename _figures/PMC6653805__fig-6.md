caption: The role of autophagy in adipocytes–macrophages cross-talk. In physiological
  conditions, autophagy regulates inflammation, ROS levels, and M1 to M2 shift in
  macrophages population. During inflammatory conditions, such as diabetes or HFD,
  autophagy is impaired in macrophages, which impair ROS regulation, cytokine production,
  and M1/M2 ratio. Concomitantly, increased inflammatory cytokines such as IL1β, IL18,
  and TNFα produced by M1 macrophages inhibit Akt signaling pathway in adipocytes,
  resulting in the development of insulin resistance. Leptin produced by adipocytes
  inhibits autophagy, which impact ER stress response and inflammation in adipocytes.
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HFD, high-fat diet; ROS, reactive oxygen species. Color
  images are available online.
