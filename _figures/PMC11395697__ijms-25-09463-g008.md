caption: Tumor–immune interactions and the dynamic interplay between tumor killing
  and immunosuppressive mechanisms. The image presents a comprehensive overview of
  the complex interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, highlighting
  the dynamic interplay between tumor-killing mechanisms and immunosuppressive pathways
  within the tumor microenvironment. Key effector cells like natural killer (NK) cells
  and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can directly eliminate tumor cells through the
  release of cytotoxic granules, while being activated by the presentation of tumor
  antigens by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and the presence of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α, which also enhance the expression of MHC molecules
  and tumor antigens, making them more susceptible to immune recognition. Chemokines
  like CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 promote the trafficking of these effector cells into
  the tumor site, facilitating their antitumor functions. Conversely, regulatory T
  cells (Tregs) and immunosuppressive cytokines like TGF-β, IL-10, and IL-4 create
  an inhibitory environment that dampens the activity of effector immune cells. Myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs) inhibit T cell responses through the production of enzymes
  like arginase (ARG1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), which deplete essential nutrients and induce oxidative stress. Other
  enzymes like indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO)
  deplete the essential amino acid tryptophan, leading to metabolic stress and suppression
  of T cell responses. Additionally, factors like VEGF, COX2, and PGE2 not only support
  tumor growth but also contribute to the recruitment and function of immunosuppressive
  cell types. This intricate balance and crosstalk between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  signals within the tumor microenvironment ultimately determines the overall efficacy
  of the antitumor immune response or the establishment of an immunosuppressive state
  that favors tumor progression, with the balance often tipped towards progression
  in advanced stages of cancer. Figure created using BioRender
