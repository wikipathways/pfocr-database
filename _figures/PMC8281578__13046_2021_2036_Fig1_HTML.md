caption: 'Activating stimuli and molecules involved in the two types of NETosis: lytic
  NETosis (left) consists in a mechanism that effectively kills neutrophils, which
  by breaking down releases the filamentous lattice made of decondensed chromatin,
  histones, and lytic enzymes into the extracellular space. Known activators of lytic/suicidal
  NETosis are PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) and antibodies through binding
  to the Fc receptor; extracellular signals lead to calcium-dependent activation of
  NADPH oxidase and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS cause the activation
  of the PAD4 enzyme and translocation from granules to the nucleus of Neutrophil
  Elastase (NE) and Myeloperoxidase (MPO); combined action of PAD4, NE, and MPO results
  in citrullination of histones, in particular H3, and subsequent chromatin decondensation.
  The nuclear membrane of neutrophils breaks, and the chromatin mixed with enzymes
  and histones is released first into the cytoplasm and then into the extracellular
  space, following the rupture of the cell membrane, forming Neutrophil Extracellular
  Traps (NETs). In vital NETosis (right), the neutrophil remains intact releasing
  the reticulum via a system of vesicles; the latter mechanism appears to be independent
  of NADPH oxidase activation. Microbial infections, especially from S. aureus, recognized
  by Toll-Like Receptor-2 (TLR2) or Complement Receptor and LPS-activated platelets
  that bind Toll-Like Receptor-4 are among the major proven activators of this second
  pathway'
