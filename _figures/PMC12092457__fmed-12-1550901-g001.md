caption: SPC25 is an important part of the NDC80 centromere complex. SPC25 ensures
  the stability of the centromate-microtubule attachment through interactions with
  other NDC80 complex components, thus maintaining chromosome integrity. Its function
  is strictly regulated by multiple layers of transcriptional regulation, post-translational
  modification, and cell cycle dependent interactions. SPC25 not only plays an important
  role in chromosome stability and cell division, but also interacts with a variety
  of key signaling pathways for tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis.
  These pathways include the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, PI3K/AKT pathway, and p53 signaling
  pathway. Thus, dysregulation of SPC25 in various cancers makes it a promising candidate
  for biomarker development and targeted therapy
