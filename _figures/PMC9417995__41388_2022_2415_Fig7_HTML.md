caption: A TRAF4 and SMURF2 oppositely regulate HER2 and downstream AKT/mTOR pathway.
  SMURF2 binds to the HER2 cytoplasmic domain, and directly ubiquitinates it leading
  to HER2 degradation, whereas TRAF4 stabilizes HER2 by degrading SMURF2 and inhibiting
  the binding of SMURF2 to HER2. B TRAF4 upregulation mediates Trastuzumab resistance.
  Upregulated TRAF4 following Trastuzumab treatment protects HER2 receptor and downstream
  AKT/mTOR pathway via accelerating SMURF2 degradation and deportation from HER2.
  C TRAF4 inhibition leads to improved Trastuzumab sensitivity. Increased SMURF2 protein
  level after TRAF4 knockdown or knockout downregulates HER2 and downstream AKT/mTOR
  pathway.
