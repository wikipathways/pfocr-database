caption: Signaling pathways involved in JSRV Env-induced cell transformation. Depending

  in JSRV transformed cells; the PI3K/Akt pathway, the Hyal2-RON pathway, and the
  Ras-MEK-ERK pathway. Signaling through the TLR4-NFkB pathway is also depicted, since
  the JSRV Env interacts with TLR4, though activation of this pathway has yet to be
  formally shown. A fourth pathway; via signaling through Rac1, has recently been
  identified, but less is known about it []. Except for the Hyal2-RON pathway, how
  the JSRV Env engages the Ras-MEK-ERK or the PI3K/Akt pathways is not known. Possible
  interactions, or yet to be identified factors that may be involved in JSRV Env-mediated
  transformation, are indicated with question marks (?). Each pathway involved in
  JSRV Env-transformation leads to the activation of factors involved in cell survival,
  proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. See text for details.
