caption: Refined subnetwork using reconstructed pseudo time-series data (left) compared
  with experimental validated network in () (right). Text label on each edge indicates
  the differentiation pathway used to predict that edge. In the experimental validated
  network, the known relationship between SCL and GATA2 () is not shown; on the other
  hand, NFE2 is only predicted to be positively correlated with GATA2 in ()
