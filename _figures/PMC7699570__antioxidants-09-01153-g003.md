caption: 'Mitochondria as a target of CO action. CO has been shown to preserve mitochondrial
  function at low concentration, including preservation of mitochondrial membrane
  potential which can be disrupted by pro-inflammatory stimuli []. Stimulation of
  various cell types with CO can modulate mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) production, in
  a cell type specific and context-specific manner [,,,,,,]. CO can also modulate
  the activity of mitochondrial hemoproteins, including cytochrome c oxidase (COX).
  At high concentration CO can inhibit mitochondrial respiration, inhibit mitochondrial
  energy (ATP) production [], and also modulate the glycolytic pathway in a dose-dependent
  manner [,]. CO has been implicated in several cellular effects, which include the
  modulation of apoptosis [,] and (inflammasome-dependent) inflammation [,], that
  are mediated by mitochondria-derived soluble factors, including cytochrome-c (Cyt-c)
  and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), respectively. Finally, CO has been shown to act as
  a potent modulator of mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis in various studies [,,,,,,].
  These effects were contingent on the upregulation of regulatory factors: PPAR-γ
  coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), and mitochondrial
  transcription factor A (TFAM) [].'
