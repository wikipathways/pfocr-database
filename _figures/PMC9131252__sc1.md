caption: Illustration of how regulating surface electrical polarization intensity
  on ferroelectric nanocomposite membranes can enhance SHED neurogenic differentiation.
  The neurogenic differentiation of SHED appears to be dose-dependently affected by
  surface charge, accompanied by changes in cell morphology, including increased cell
  spreading area and enhanced neurite length. Further molecular mechanism analysis
  revealed that surface charge stimulates opening of calcium channels on the cell
  membrane, resulting in increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, which
  might lead to activation of pro-neurogenic signaling pathways in SHED including
  the ErbB signaling pathway, cell focal adhesion-related pathways and regulation
  of actin cytoskeleton. On one hand, ErbB-1/2 acts on FAK and downstream Src, triggering
  the mechanosensing pathway RhoA/Rock, increasing Paxillin phosphorylation, which
  in turn might facilitate neurite outgrowths. On the other hand, the PI3K/Akt/mTOB
  signaling pathway is also triggered by ErbB-2/4.
