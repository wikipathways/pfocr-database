caption: Schematic map of phenolic biosynthesis pathway involved in wheat grains during
  the grain filling stage. The 1 × 6 heat map represents normalized relative metabolite
  abundance of grains at a different stage. Red color represents higher abundance,
  and green color represents lower abundance. HPm-20, HPm-30, and HPm-M are samples
  from cultivar HP512 at 20 days after anthesis (DAA), 30 DAA, and maturity, respectively.
  ZM-20, ZM-30, and ZM-M are samples from cultivar ZM22 at 20 DAA, 30 DAA, and maturity,
  respectively. Metabolites in black color represent significantly expressed metabolites.
  The gene number in black color represents the biosynthesis process, which is catalyzed
  by the enzyme encoded by this gene. The gene number in red color represents a significant
  correlation between this gene and its nearby metabolite. CAD, Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase;
