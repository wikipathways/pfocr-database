caption: The potential mechanism of MCP-1-promoted tumor development. MCP-1 can not
  only utilize monocytes, Treg cells, endothelial cells and fibrocytes but also act
  on tumor directly to affect tumor development. The precise mechanism of MDSC transforming
  into TAM is not clear. TAM advances tumor development in many respects, including
  EMT, angiogenesis and tumor stromal formation. Treg cells and tumor cells can induce
  the process of EMT through IL-33/NF-κB and ERK/GSK-3α/Snail, respectively. MCP-1
  facilitates tumor proliferation, migration and angiogenesis through specific pathways,
  such as ERK/GSK-3β/Snail for migration, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR for angiogenesis. In addition,
  MCP-1 also promotes tumor angiogenesis by acting on endothelial cells via the PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway and suppressing TNFSF15. MCP-1 is also a promoter for fibrocytes
  that synthesize tumor stromal. Notably, MCP-1 is the engine for tumor development
  and shutting off the engine will inhibit this process. TNFS15, tumor necrosis factor
  superfamily-15; TAM, tumor-associated macrophage; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor
  cell; MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition;
  Treg, regulatory T lymphocyte.
