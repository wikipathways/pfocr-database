caption: Stromal cellular signaling facilitates leukemic stem cell (LSC) survival,
  quiescence, and drug resistance. LSCs engage in bidirectional crosstalk with multiple
  BM cellular constituents. E-selectin expressed on the surface of endothelial cells
  interacts with CD44 on LSCs to drive LSC homing and retention in the protective
  BM microenvironment, sheltering LSCs from therapeutic insults. Furthermore, endothelial
  cells also release microRNA (miRNA)-containing extracellular vesicles to further
  enrich the quiescence phenotype of LSCs. Osteoblasts primarily release proinflammatory
  cytokines that lead to the transcription of genes implicated in LSC survival, self-renewal,
  and quiescence. Mesenchymal stromal cells are known to physically transfer mitochondria
  to LSCs via nanotubes to repair and replace damaged mitochondria with new ones inside
  LSCs, potentially helping LSCs evade apoptosis. Mesenchymal stromal cells can also
  activate pro-survival integrin-mediated signaling in LSCs, involving the PI3K/AKT
  pathway. Moreover, adipocytes assist in the rewiring of LSC metabolism, supplying
  free fatty acids to fuel oxidative phosphorylation, a known metabolic dependency
  of LSCs.
