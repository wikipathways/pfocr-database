caption: Viral infection in (A) D. melanogaster activates the RNAi, JAK-STAT, immune
  deficiency (Imd), and Toll pathways, whereas (B) molluscs rely on the RNAi pathway
  and homologs of an ancient IFN-like pathway. The RNAi involves Dicer-2 cleaving
  viral dsRNA to form siRNAs, which interact with RISC to seek and bind to complementary
  viral mRNA. The JAK-STAT pathway is activated when Upd cytokines bind to Dome, triggering
  JAK, and, subsequently STAT and vir-1, the latter of which may also be upregulated
  by RISC. The JAK-STAT pathway also upregulates PI3K and Akt to mediate TOR, which
  controls the autophagic response. The NF-κB effector genes, which in turn regulate
  cytokine levels and other transcriptional responses, can be upregulated following
  either the Imd or Toll pathway, the latter of which involves the intracellular signaling
  cascade of proteins such as dMyD88, Tube, and Pelle. Modified figure derived from
