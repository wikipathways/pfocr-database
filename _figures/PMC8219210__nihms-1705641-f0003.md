caption: Molecular determinants governing the fertility-immunity axis in invertebrates.
  There is extensive literature documenting the mutual impacts of reproductive activity
  and immunity in invertebrates. Studies in the fruit fly, D. melanogaster (top),
  and the nematode, C. elegans (bottom), have begun to reveal the underlying molecular
  pathways. In D. melanogaster (top panel), major endocrine signaling cascades, the
  juvenile hormone (JH) pathway and the 20 hydroxy ecdysterone (20E) pathway, that
  control growth and maturation, have antagonistic impacts on fertility and immunity.
  JH promotes reproduction and inhibits immunity, along with the conserved growth
  regulator, the insulin/IGF1 signaling (IIS) pathway, whereas, 20E acts as an immune
  activator. The IIS pathway also inhibits immune activity and supports reproductive
  health in C. elegans (bottom panel). Recent studies in worms have also identified
  transcription factors with roles in this relationship. TCER-1, worm homolog of human
  transcription elongation and splicing factor, TCERG1, promotes reproductive fitness
  and represses innate immunity. CEH-60 and UNC-62, worm orthologs of the TALE class
  of homeodomain proteins, PBX and MEIS, act in a complex to mediate fat transport
  into oocytes, and to repress innate-immune genes’ expression, facilitating allocation
  of lipids towards fertility.
