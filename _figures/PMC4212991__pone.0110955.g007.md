caption: SRF can bypass P-gp mediated drug efflux via mechanism(s) that are currently
  unknown. Inside the cell, SRF binds and inhibits microtubule polymerization resulting
  in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. These events, in turn, activate JNK-mediated
  stress-response signaling cascade leading to the phosphorylation and inactivation
  of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and Bad. Consequently, there is loss of mitochondrial
  membrane potential and integrity, release of cytochrome-c, activation of caspase-3
  and eventual cell death by apoptosis. Thus, SRF-mediated cell death proceeds via
  the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
