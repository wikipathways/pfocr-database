caption: Schematic view of the ferroptosis pathway. Ferroptosis pursues upon aberrant
  build-up of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to peroxidation (-OOH) of
  polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Main peroxidation target PUFAs are arachidonic
  acid (AA) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid species within cellular membranes
  leading to membrane destabilisation and rupture. Lipid peroxidation can be triggered
  by cytosolic redox active iron (Fe2+) shuttled into cells bound to transferrin via
  transferrin receptor (TFRC) endocytosis and endosomal release mediated by divalent
  metal transporter 1 (DMT1). In the presence of H2O2, Fe2+ catalyses hydroxyl radical
  (HO∙) generation in a Fenton reaction, which sets of a radical lipid peroxidation
  chain reaction. Lipoxygenase (LOX) can equally catalyse lipid peroxidation using
  Fe2+. As a required prerequisite for ferroptosis, Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain
  family member 4 (ACSL4) and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) generate
  the pool of AA-containing target lipids. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), in turn,
  hydrolyses lipid peroxides converting them into their respective non-toxic lipid
  alcohols (-OH). GPX4 requires glutathione (GSH) as a cofactor which upon its oxidation
  (GSSG) by GPX4 is reduced to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). GSH synthesis depends
  on glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione synthetase (GSS) as well as on
  intracellular cystine shuttled into the cell in exchange for glutamate mediated
  by system xc- (SLC3A2 and SCL7A11/xCT). Independently of GSH, ferroptosis suppressor
  protein 1 (FSP1) generates ubiquinol from ubiquinone which acts as a lipophilic
  radical trapping agent within membranes thereby protecting from ferroptosis. Oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle have both been described
  to be required for ferroptosis triggered by cystine-depletion or system xc- but
  not GPX4 inhibition.
