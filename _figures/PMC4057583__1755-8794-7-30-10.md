caption: Link between NFKBIA and EGFR pathway in Glioblastoma. The relationship between
  EGFR and NF-kB signaling was performed using IPA Path Designer tool. Solid line
  indicates direct biological relationship. Dashed line indicates indirect biological
  relationship. The relationship between molecules were supported by IPA knowledge
  base. EGF signaling to NF-kB is affected by NFKBIA inhibition.
