caption: Leptin and jak-stat in cancer. (A) JAK2/STAT3 signaling and crosstalk in
  cancer. Key regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway are shown via activation or inhibition
  as identified by the Pathway Studio program (Ariadine Genomics, Rockville, MD, USA),
  which shows extensive crosstalk between molecules. Crosstalk and convergence of
  different signaling pathways are necessary for STAT activation of DNA-binding or
  transcriptional activity. The JAK/STAT pathway can regulate a plethora of processes
  including apoptosis, cell differentiation, and angiogenesis, all of which are associated
  with cancer growth and metastasis. The leptin-induced JAK2/STAT pathway plays an
  important role in obesity-related cancers. A detailed description of relationships
  detected is included in the ; (B) The JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Upon binding ligand
  to CK or GF receptor, the receptor-associated JAK becomes activated and mediates
  JAK phosphorylation while also phosphorylating the intracellular tail of the receptor.
  This leads to the recruitment of specific STATs, which are then also activated through
  phosphorylation. Activated STATs are released from the receptor, dimerize, translocate
  to the nucleus, and bind to the DNA-promoter regions of target genes.
