caption: Proposed pathogenic mechanisms of α-syn-related Lewy body formation in PD.
  The failure of clearance of α-syn and/or acceleration of α-syn aggregation is associated
  with failure of protein quality control systems, such as ubiquitin-proteasome system
  (UPS) or lysosomal degradation (e.g., autophagy-lysosomal pathway; ALP). The mitochondrial
  dysfunction caused by genetic and environmental factors, auto-oxidation of dopamine
  (Ox-DA) or decreased antioxidant molecules (e.g., DJ-1) produces unfavorable reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). Overproduction of ROS accelerates α-syn aggregation, and which
  is accelerated by interaction with Aβ and tau oligomers and vice versa.
