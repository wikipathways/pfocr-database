caption: Cerebellum (CB)-specific biological processes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
  brain. a In total, 120 proteins that showed CB-specific alterations were enriched
  for molecular processes in STRING using default setting. Each node represents a
  protein, and proteins involved in b significantly enriched pathways were highlighted.
  c Dysregulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was highlighted by
  pathway analysis, and proteins affected mapped (red star) into the NADH dehydrogenase
  complex in KEGG oxidative phosphorylation map
