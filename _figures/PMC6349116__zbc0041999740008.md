caption: Model of the regulatory cross-talk between the calpain/calpastatin pathway
  and NFI in MG cells. In the cytoplasm, calcineurin is cleaved and activated by calpain.
  Activated calcineurin translocates to the nucleus, dephosphorylates, and activates
  NFI. Hypophosphorylated NFI up-regulates cell migration–promoting FABP7 as well
  as CAST variants that exclude the XL domain and preferentially localize to the cytoplasm.
  NFI also negatively affects the expression of plasma membrane–associated full-length
  calpastatin. As a consequence, calpastatin–calpain interaction at the plasma membrane
  is reduced, calpain remains active, calpain target effectors are cleaved, and MG
  cell migration is enhanced.
