caption: Potential HDAC-mediated Nox expression in hyperglycemia. (A) Hyperglycemia
  may increase the expression of some class 1 HDACs (HDAC 1 and 2), which are suggested
  to complex with transcription factors and facilitate Nox expression. (B) The increased
  expression of Nox isozymes and increased oxidative stress induced by hyperglycemia
  have been implicated in the export of the class 2a HDAC4 from the nucleus. (C) HDAC4
  is suggested to repress Nox expression suggesting a potential feed-forward signaling
  pathway where Nox-derived ROS remove HDAC4 repression of Nox transcription. HDAC,
  histone deacetylase. Color images are available online.
