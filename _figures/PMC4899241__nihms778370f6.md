caption: 'The biological function of extracellular HMGB1 is redox dependent. HMGB1
  contains three cysteines: two in the A box domain (Cys23 and Cys45) and one in the
  B box domain (Cys106). Fully reduced extracellular HMGB1 forms a heterodimer with
  CXCL12, which engages with CXCR4 to activate downstream signaling pathways, such
  as the PI3K pathway, leading to the chemotaxis of leukocytes (). A disulfide bond
  can form between Cys23 and Cys45. This variant of HMGB1 can bind to RAGE () and
  TLR4 () to activate the NF-κB pathway and induce production of proinflammatory cytokines.
  Terminal oxidation of Cys106 to −SO3H restricts the cytokine-stimulating activity
  of HMGB1 and is found after inflammation has resolved (). Abbreviations: Cys, cysteine;
  HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; RAGE, receptor
  for advanced glycation end products; TLR4, Toll-like receptor-4.'
