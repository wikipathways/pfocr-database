caption: 'The central role of Beclin-1 during autophagy. Autophagy phases could be
  divided into: initiation, nucleation and formation of the phagophore, elongation
  and formation of the autophagosome, and fusion with the lysosome to form the autophagolysosome
  for degradation. The initiation step is mainly controlled by the Unc-51 like autophagy
  activating kinase (ULK) complex. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes initiation
  of autophagy activating the ULK complex. Also, mammalian target of rapamycin complex
  1 (mTORC1) inhibits autophagy by regulating ULK1 phosphorylation. mTORC1 activity
  is inhibited by the Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (TSC1, TSC2). AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) positively regulates autophagy by promoting TSC complex. Furthermore,
  tyrosine kinase receptors constitute upstream regulators of mTORC1 by promoting
  Akt activity, which inhibit TSC, by means of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) production by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) class I. The tumor suppressor
  phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) promotes this signaling. Once the autophagic
  induction has been triggered, the class III PI3K complex allows the formation of
  the phagophore. The Beclin-1 complex is constituted by Beclin-1, ATG14, vacuolar
  protein sorting 34 (Vps34), vacuolar protein sorting 15 (Vps15) and autophagy protein
  1 (AMBRA1). This complex I specifically focuses Beclin-1 on autophagic functions.
  Cell death induction by cell death receptor activation leads to caspase-8 cleavage,
  which ultimately inactivates Beclin-1 so that cells can undergo apoptosis. Beclin-1
  interactions with Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bim prevent its association with the
  pre-autophagosomal membrane, blocking autophagy. This inhibition could be reversed
  by high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase 1 (JNK), Noxa,
  BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) and death-associated
  protein kinase (DAPK) related signaling. Beclin-1 also displays non-autophagic properties
  when assembled into the Beclin-1 complex II, in conjunction with UV radiation resistance
  associated (UVRAG), BIF-1, AMBRA1, Vps34 and Vps15. In this complex, Beclin-1 participates
  in the endosomal pathway of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), transferrin
  receptor type 1 (TFR1) and HER2. Receptors could be internalized into endosomes
  and sorted to multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). Together with phosphatidylinositol
  3-phosphate (PI3P) production and recruitment of hepatocyte growth factor tyrosine
  kinase substrate (HRS). Beclin-1 promotes degradation of receptors after fusion
  with lysosomes. Otherwise, in the absence of Beclin-1, receptors would be recycled
  to the plasma membrane to promote survival. Beclin-1 pivots between both complexes
  to promote anti-tumoral functions. Other two complexes participate in the elongation
  of the pre-autophagosomal membrane: the LC3 conjugation system and the ATG12-ATG5
  system. After formation, the autophagosome fuses with lysosomes, where syntaxin
  17 (STX17) plays a major role.'
