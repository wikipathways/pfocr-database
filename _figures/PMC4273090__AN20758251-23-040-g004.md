caption: Possible pathway of activation of the store-operated calcium channels with
  different reversal potentials in SKN- SH Htt138Q-1exon STIM1 (-) cells. In this
  scheme, it is shown that activation of all types of store-operated channels could
  be observed under conditions of a large quantity of the STIM1 protein, resulting
  in average I-V curves of these currents with a medium reversal potential (A). Suppression
  of the STIM1 protein could lead to preferential activation of one type of store-operated
  channels with a high (B) or low (C) reversal potential. It also could lead to activation
  of an equal quantity of both channels with low and high reversal potentials (D).
  Channels with a high reversal potential are represented by blue ovals and a blue
  line on the plot. Channels with a low reversal potential are represented by red
  rectangles and a red line on the plot. Activation of both channel types is shown
  as black lines on the plots. Reversal potentials are shown by dotted lines of the
  corresponding colors
