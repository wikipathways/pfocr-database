caption: Signaling to eukaryotic translation initiation and elongation factors. mTOR
  signaling, in combination with the PI3K pathway, activates the translation of rapamycin-sensitive
  mRNAs. In the presence of sufficient nutrients to fuel protein synthesis, mTOR and
  PI3K signaling activate the S6Ks, and one or more unknown kinases, to effect phosphorylation
  of the ribosomal S6 protein, eIF4B, eIF4GI, and the 4E-BPs. In response to agents
  that raise intracellular Ca2+ (such as glutamate or NMDA), a specific Ca2+/CaM-dependent
  kinase effects the phosphorylation of eEF2 to inhibit elongation. mTOR signaling
  has been reported to inhibit eEF2 phosphorylation (possibly via inhibition of the
  eEF2 kinase), and thus, to increase elongation rates. Phosphatases have been implicated
  in the dephosphorylation of several translation effectors, but are not depicted
  in this figure.
