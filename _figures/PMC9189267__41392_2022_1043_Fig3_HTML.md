caption: The sophisticated associations of SARS-CoV-2, host system, and cell pyroptosis.
  Activated TLRs, TNFR, and IL-1R1 pathways induce NF-κB activation to promote pro-inflammatory
  cytokines production including pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, procaspase-1, and NLRP3. The
  PAMPs and DAMPs caused by SARS-CoV-2 immediately activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
  to cleave procaspase-1 that subsequently cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Meanwhile,
  caspase-1-cleaved GSDMD inserts into the membrane to form pores, leading to cell
  pyroptosis and contents release. SARS-CoV-2 N protein, NSP5, NSP1, and NSP13 inhibit
  infected cell pyroptosis via impeding the caspase-1 or GSDMD. On the contrary, more
  commonly, SARS-CoV-2 promotes cell pyroptosis in various ways. SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a
  and N protein directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. The ion imbalance caused
  by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and E protein and lysosomal dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2
  ORF3a, ORF7a, and NSP16 both promote the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In addition,
  the MAVS pathway activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mitochondria damage and
  the activation of NF-κB and IRF. Besides, SARS-CoV-2-related ROS production and
  mtDNA release also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Meanwhile, dsDNA and mtDNA-induced
  AIM2 inflammasome and LPS-induced caspase-4/5/11 also induce cell pyroptosis. From
  the perspective of the host, the Ang II-AT1R axis and the MBL-MASP-mediated complement
  system are involved in infected cell pyroptosis. SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory
