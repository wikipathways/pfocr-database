  representation of a M. truncatula symbiotic nodule primordium, including selected
  known components of the Rhizobium Nod factor signaling pathway (Nod Factor Perception/Lys-M
  Kinase receptor [NFP/LYK], Does Not Make Infections/Calcium Calmodulin Protein Kinase
  [DMI3/CCaMK], Nod factor Signaling Pathway2 [NSP2]) and of the cytokinin signaling
  pathway (Cytokinin Response1 [CRE1], Response Regulators []). New genes identified
  in this study as acting downstream of the CRE1/ cytokinin pathway are also indicated:
  the miR171 h isoform targeting NSP2 and the new direct cytokinin targets bHLH476
  and CKX1. Proven interactions are indicated by full lines, and putative interactions
  by dotted lines.Orange indicates epidermis, green indicates cortex, yellow indicates
  endodermis, red indicates pericycle, brown indicates stele, and blue indicates nodule
  primordium.'
