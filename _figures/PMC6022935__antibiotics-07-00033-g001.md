caption: Streptomyces lividans major secretory route (Sec pathway). The secretory
  protein precursor is targeted to the membrane translocation complex by SRP, which
  is a GTP-dependent process, that requires the help of the FtsY receptor. When the
  signal peptidases (exemplified by the major signal peptidase, SipY) act, the SRP
  components are released to be used again. The extracellular presence of incorrectly
  folded mature proteins triggers the expression of the CssRS two-component system,
  which, in turn, induces the synthesis of the three HtrA-like proteins that are working
  cooperatively and degrades the incorrectly folded extracellular proteins. The acquisition
  of an active, correctly folded structure may need the action of enzymes involved
  in the formation of disulfide bonds (Dsbs) and/or peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases
  (FKBP-like).
