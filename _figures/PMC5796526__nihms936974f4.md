caption: (a) (Left) DBF4-dependent kinase (DDK) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
  activities promote origin firing. DDK phosphorylates the minichromosome maintenance
  2-7 complex helicase (MCM), and CDK phosphorylates Treslin. These phosphorylations
  promote recruitment of cell division cycle 45 (CDC45) and other pre-initiation complex
  (pre-IC) factors to activate the helicase.(Right) ATR may suppress origin firing
  through at least two distinct pathways. The first is through phosphorylation and
  stabilization of myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL). This promotes
  MLL association with chromatin where it methylates histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4me). This
  chromatin modification blocks CDC45 loading onto nearby origins. The second pathway
  is through ATR-dependent activation of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which negatively
  regulates CDK-dependent phosphorylations at origins, thereby blocking the loading
  of CDC45 and other pre-IC factors. CHK1 also directly phosphorylates Treslin, which
  limits CDC45 binding to origins. (b and c) ATR allows local dormant origins to fire
  in response to replication stress. (b) When a replication fork is stalled, nearby
  dormant origins fire to help complete DNA synthesis in its vicinity. At the same
  time, cells also block origin firing in later replicating regions. This prevents
  the accumulation of additional replication stress and the potential depletion of
  replication factors or nucleotides. (c) It is unclear how ATR allows dormant origins
  to fire locally. One proposed mechanism involves inhibition of CHK1 activity in
  the vicinity of the stalled polymerase. ATR activated at the stalled fork can phosphorylates
  MCM2 locally, primarily at nearby unfired origins. MCM2 phosphorylation creates
  a docking site for polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which suppresses activation of CHK1
  and allows recruitment of CDC45 to nearby origins.ORC, origin recognition complex
