caption: Glycolysis generates various metabolic intermediates that support cell growth
  and provide metabolites for secondary pathways. Glucose metabolism produces pyruvate,
  regardless of oxygen availability. In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the TCA
  cycle and participates in OXPHOS. In contrast, under low oxygen conditions, cells
  undergo anaerobic glycolysis, resulting in the production of lactate as a byproduct.
  AML cells heavily rely on glycolysis, making them particularly vulnerable to treatment
  with glycolytic inhibitors. The glycolytic inhibitors are indicated in the red boxes.
