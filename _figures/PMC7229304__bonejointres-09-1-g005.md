caption: Applications of mechanotransduction. a) Shockwaves induce hyperpolarization
  of the cell membrane with subsequent induction of the osteogenic growth factor,
  transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), as well as synthesizing oxygen free
  radicals. b) Vibrations and nanovibrations enhance the oscillatory fluid flow in
  the interstitial fluid of the lacuno-canalicular (LC) network, increasing the fluid
  shear forces that stimulate integrin receptors. Upregulation of integrin activity
  stimulates Sonic Hedgehog pathways and Rho A pathways leading to upregulation of
  osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OCN), osteonectin (ONN), and Osterix (OSX) proteins.
  c) Electrical stimulation can increase the influx of calcium through voltage-gated
  ion channels, modulating calmodulin kinase (CAMK) pathways leading to increased
  expression of the osteogenic gene Runx2 and OSX. d) Ultrasound waves enhance integrin
  receptor activity, stimulating cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway synthesis via protein
  kinase B (AKT), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and extracellular-signal related kinase
  (ERK) pathways. This leads to the upregulation of osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein
  and insulin growth factor. RhoA, Ras homolog family member A.
