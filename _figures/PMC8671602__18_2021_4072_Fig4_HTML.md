caption: DExD/H-box helicases regulate the NLR signaling pathway. Activated inflammasomes
  could cleave Pro IL-1β and Pro IL-18 into mature IL-1β and IL-18. DExD/H-box helicases
  could also regulate NLRP3, NLRP9b, and NLRP6 inflammasomes and the NLRP6/MAVS signaling.
  The green arrow indicates the interaction between DExD/H-box helicases and adaptors
  and promotes signaling. P, phosphate; ISRE, IFN-stimulated response element; ASC,
  the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD
