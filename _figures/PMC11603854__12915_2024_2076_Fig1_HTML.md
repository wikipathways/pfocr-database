caption: 'The current concept of the signaling pathway underlying the β-adrenergic
  regulation of CaV1.2 in cardiomyocytes. The cascade is initiated by the binding
  of an agonist (e.g., epinephrine or norepinephrine; depicted as a small green circle)
  to a β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) which, in turn, activates the G protein Gs by catalyzing
  GDP-GTP exchange at the Gαs subunit followed by separation of the latter from the
  Gβγ subunit. The GTP-bound Gαs, alone or in concert with Gβγ, activates adenylyl
  cyclase (AC), promoting the conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP activates PKA, causing
  the dissociation of its regulatory (RS) from catalytic (CS) subunits. CS phosphorylates
  several targets including CaV1.2α1 and CaVβ subunits, but the most important target
  in CaV1.2 regulation appears to be the Rad protein. Phosphorylation of Rad removes
  the constitutive inhibition that it exerts upon channel activity, through separation
  of Rad from CaVβ. According to the classical prevalent scheme: before activation,
  the PKA holoenzyme is associated with the CaV1.2α1 subunit via an AKAP protein that
  strongly binds PKAR (the binding main sites for most AKAPs are in the dCT of CaV1.2α1);
  however, as detailed in the text, AKAPs are probably not strictly required in cardiomyocytes.
  The scheme also shows the auxiliary subunits of CaV1.2 and the cytosolic domain
  of CaV1.2α1: N-terminus (NT), C-terminus (CT) (with dCT colored dark mustard), and
  intracellular loops (shown in light gray). Also indicated are the approximate CT
  proteolytic cleavage site (scissors), major PKA phosphorylation sites in the CT
  (S1700 and S1928), and the DCRD, CBS, and PCRD domains'
