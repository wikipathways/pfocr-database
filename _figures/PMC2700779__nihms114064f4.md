caption: Schematic diagram illustrating a possible pathway by which hypoxia, chronic
  inflammation, and IGFBP-3 inhibit adiponectin transcription. Reduced adiponectin
  levels contribute to the development of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome,
  increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In obesity, adipose
  tissue exists in a hypoxic state of chronic inflammation. Both hypoxia and the pro-inflammatory
  cytokine TNF-α inhibit adiponectin expression.Rosiglitazone activates RXR-α-PPAR-γ
  heterodimers bound to a PPRE in the adiponectin promoter to stimulate adiponectin
  transcription. We show that an hypoxia-mimetic agent (cobalt chloride), TNF-α, and
  IGFBP-3 inhibit rosiglitazone-stimulated adiponectin transcription. Although the
  inhibitory effects of hypoxia and TNF-α may be direct, we hypothesize that IGFBP-3,
  whose transcription is induced by hypoxia and TNF-α [; ; ; ; ; ], may mediate their
  inhibition of adiponectin transcription by binding to RXR-α [], disrupting RXR-α-PPAR-γ
  complexes so that they cannot activate the PPRE in the adiponetin promoter.
