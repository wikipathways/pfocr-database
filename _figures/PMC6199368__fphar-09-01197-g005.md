caption: Hypothetical model to sensitize GC. DNA damage caused by CDDP leads to activation
  of NER, XPC is already in the nucleus and proteins XPA and XPD translocate to the
  nucleus to repair the lesion. Resistant cells repair properly the DNA and survive,
  however, if repair is not efficient, the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is induced
  by Mcl-1 degradation and Bid and Bad induction. Option 1 (red circle) proposes the
  inhibition of XP proteins, and option 2 (green circle) proposes the use of BH3 only
  mimetics.
