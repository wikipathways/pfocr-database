caption: Possible biosynthetic pathways of PGL and PGLN (Spot-1) molecules in Thermus
  thermophilus HB8. The details of the pathway without PGLN were drawn in the page
  version PWBA0004 of the ThermusQ website []. The black arrows are the paths drawn
  in ThermusQ. The red arrow is the predicted path based on the current study. (For
  interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred
