caption: 'The metabolic pathway of the glutathione biosynthesis via l-Ser, l-Cys and
  Gly biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. First, 3-phospho-glycerate (3PG) dehydrogenase
  encoded by SER3 and SER33 converts 3PG to 3-phospho-hydroxypyruvate (3PHP) using
  the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a cofactor. Second,
  3-phosphoserine aminotransferase encoded by SER1 transfers an amino group from l-Glu
  to the 2-oxo group of 3PHP and produces l-O-phosphoserine (LPS) and 2-oxoglutarate
  (2OG). Finally, phosphoserine phosphatase encoded by SER2 dephosphorylates LPS to
  l-Ser. The produced l-Ser is further metabolized to l-Cys and Gly by cystathionine
  β-synthase encoded by CYS4 and serine hydroxymethyltransferase encoded by SHM2,
  respectively. Other abbreviations are as follows, 5,10-CH2-THF: (6R)-5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate;
  ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ATP: adenosine triphosphate; NADH: reduced form of nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; Pi: phosphate; H2S: hydrogen sulfide; THF: tetrahydrofolate.'
