caption: 'Simplified illustration highlighting the potential role of phytochemicals
  in inhibiting inflammation-induced tumors. Tumor-associated inflammation can be
  significantly reduced by specifically targeting inflammatory cytokines. Levels of
  MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, COX-2, and PGE2 can all be lowered by phytochemicals,
  including quercetin, resveratrol, curcumin, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin gallate
  (EGCG), and lycopene demonstrating their anti-inflammatory capabilities in the context
  of chronic inflammation. These effects lead to the regulation of the PI3K/Akt, NF-κB/STAT3,
  and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways by these phytochemicals, which could inhibit
  cancer initiation, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Abbreviations:
  PGE2, prostaglandin E2; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases;
  MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; STAT3, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3; TNF-α, receptor-associated factor-α; IL, interleukin; PI3K,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B; TME, tumor microenvironment'
