caption: 'The signaling pathways involved in the pathophysiological development of
  OA, along with their corresponding targeted therapeutic drugs. During OA progression,
  pyroptosis in articular tissue cells is regulated through multiple molecular targets.
  Exposure to PAMPs or DAMPs initiates TLR-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  and Caspase-1. Subsequently, Caspase-1 and Caspase-4/5/11 cleave GSDMD to generate
  GSDMD-NT that oligomerize on plasma membranes, forming transmembrane pores. This
  process facilitates the proteolytic maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-1β and IL-18, ultimately triggering pyroptosis. The NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  is potentiated through ROS accumulation mediated by USP25/TXNIP and miR-665/MyD88
  axis, which can be pharmacologically suppressed by pioglitazone and PD184352 via
  Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Multiple regulatory pathways including IRF1/GBP5, NEK/OGT,
  miR-25-3P/CPEB1, miR-155/Smad2, and LKB1/AMPK converge on NLRP3 to modulate CC pyroptosis.
  Additional modulators such as miR-326/HDAC3/STAT1, Metrnl/PI3K/AKT, TGF-β/Smad2/3
  signaling, along with pharmacological agents ursolic acid, loganin, and α-solanine,
  exert regulatory effects through NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway manipulation. Mechanical and
  biochemical stimuli demonstrate protective potential: ATP and moderate intensity
  exercise activate P2X7R ion channels, witch subsequently activate AMPK/mTOR-mediated
  autophagy for NLRP3 inflammasome component degradation. HMGB1 and AGN regulate FLS
  pyroptosis through HIF-1α/NLRP3 signaling. Macrophage pyroptosis is modulated by
  GYY4137 via NF-κB/NLRP3 axis, while pharmacological inhibitors Degrasyn and Ac-YVAD-cmk
  specifically target NLRP3 and Caspase-1 respectively to suppress this process. (Created
