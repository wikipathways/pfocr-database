caption: Inflammation and mitochondrial oxidative stress in response to hypoxic condition.
  During hypoxia, Hypoxic-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1α) stimulates the transcription
  of target genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress-transcription factors.
  Moreover, HIF-1α increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) levels,
  activating nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB)
  transcription factor, stimulating the inflammasome genes expression, including NOD-,
  LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein (NLRC)4, NLRP3, and interleukin 1β (IL1β)
  genes. Ultimately causing oxidative damage to the mitochondrial membrane, this event
  affects the membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation, and mtDNA, resulting in mitochondrial
  dysfunction. The FosfoInositide-3-Kinasi (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT)-mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway upregulates HIF-1α during hypoxia.
