caption: Mitochondrial regulation of HSCs. HSCs exhibit an immature mitochondrial
  network with globular mitochondria and primitive cristae. They rely heavily on glycolysis
  and display a low metabolic profile and OxPHOS activity accompanied by low mitochondrial
  ROS levels, mass, and membrane potential. During transition from quiescent to active
  cycling, HSCs increase their mitochondrial activity and potential to meet the increased
  demands of cycling cells for energy and metabolic bioproducts. During active cycling
  and divisions, suppression of the mitochondrial activity and activation of the p53
  pathway are however required for HSCs to retain their self-renewing potential. By
  contrast, more committed progenitors display a mature mitochondrial network with
  the tubular mitochondria filled with a high number of regular cristae. Moreover,
  they exhibit high mitochondrial OxPHOS activity accompanied by high membrane potential,
  ROS generation, and mass. Ex vivo reprograming of more committed progenitors to
  actively dividing HSCs and their expansion are tightly linked to remodeling of a
  primitive mitochondrial network with low mitochondrial OxPHOS activity, increased
  glycolysis, and activation of the p53 pathway.
