caption: Schematic drawing showing the TNF-driven survival and apoptosis balance.
  TNF signaling induces controlled cell death through the caspase activation cascade.
  This is counteracted by a survival pathway acting through a TRAF2-driven and NF-kB-mediated
  transcription of antiapoptotic proteins including members of the c-IAP family (c-IAP1
  and 2 and Survivin) acting on the effector caspases 3 and 7 or members of the Bcl-2
  family acting on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by blocking the release of
  cytochrome c. TNFR = tumor necrosis factor receptor; TRADD = TNFR associated death
  domain; FADD = FAS associating protein with death domain.
