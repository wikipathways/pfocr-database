caption: 'Roles of auxins and cytokinins in legume-rhizobia symbiotic interactions.
  The scheme represents an early rhizobial infection event in a legume (Medicago truncatula)
  root leading to the formation of an indeterminate nodule. Rhizobia produce specific
  Nod factor signaling molecules as well as auxin and cytokinin hormones. A major
  contribution of Nod factor signals in establishing rhizobial infection events (i.e.,
  symbiont recognition, infection thread formation and progression) in root hairs
  has been demonstrated, whereas cytokinins produced by rhizobia may only have a minor
  contribution, and a role for a WT-level bacterial production of auxins remains to
  be established. Plant and/or bacterial hormones lead to the activation of cytokinin
  and auxin responses in infected epidermal cells, respectively, monitored by Type
  A RRs (RRA) genes or the TCS (Two Component output Sensor) cytokinin-response marker
  and the GH3 (Gretchen Hagen3) auxin responsive gene or the DR5 auxin-response marker.
  The activation of cytokinin responses in the root epidermis may lead to an inhibition
  of Nod factor signaling and/or rhizobial infections whereas the activation of auxin
  responses may promote rhizobial infections. The activation of these root epidermal
  cytokinin responses depends on the CRE1 (Cytokinin Response 1) receptor (LHK1, standing
  for Lotus Histidine Kinase1, being its functional homolog in Lotus japonicus) whereas
  the activation of the auxin epidermal responses depends on ARF16a (Auxin Response
  Factor 16a, a transcription factor). A cytokinin response is additionally activated
  in dividing cortical cells and nodule primordia, also depending on the CRE1 (LHK1)
  receptor, promoting nodule organogenesis even in the absence of symbiotic signals
  (rhizobia or Nod factors). An activation of auxin responses is observed in the cortex
  downstream of the CRE1-cytokinin pathway, involving local changes in polar auxin
  transport associated to the activation of specific flavonoid metabolite production
  and changes in PIN (PIN-formed) auxin-eﬄux carriers expression and accumulation.
  Ultimately, the activation of these auxin and cytokinin responses is linked to modulations
  of the cell cycle leading either to infection thread formation (epidermis) or cell
  divisions (cortex). It remains open if the auxin and/or cytokinin hormonal pools
  may, in addition to originate from plants and/or bacteria, accumulate upon rhizobial/Nod
  factors activation specifically in the infected epidermis, in the activated cortex,
  or in both root tissues. In addition, divergences in these hormonal responses are
  observed between determinate and indeterminate nodule types (e.g., L. japonicus
  versus M. truncatula model legumes), notably regarding the role of CRE1 versus LHK1
  cytokinin receptors in regulating infections in the epidermis, the involvement of
  polar auxin transport in root inner tissues, and the contribution of a local auxin
  biosynthesis in these different root tissues. Dark green: root hairs and epidermis;
