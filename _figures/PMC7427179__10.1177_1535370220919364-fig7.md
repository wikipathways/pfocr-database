caption: Schematic model of the protective mechanism of valsartan against HG-induced
  PF in PMCs. Valsartan significantly inhibits HG-induced ECM accumulation in the
  peritoneum, which manifests as decreased expression levels of α-SMA and collagen
  I. These effects are correlated with a decrease in the expression of the mTORC1
  pathway, which is mediated by the downregulation of p-mTOR, p-4EBP1, and p-S6K1
  levels. Overall, valsartan exerts an obvious protective effect against HG-induced
  PF, which is partly due to the inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway in PMCs. (A color
  version of this figure is available in the online journal.)
