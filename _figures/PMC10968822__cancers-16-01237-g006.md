caption: 'YY1 regulation of PD-L1: Transcriptional. YY1 regulates PD-L1 transcriptionally
  through binding to the promoter region found on the PD-L1 CD274 gene. It is also
  regulated via the p38/MAPK/JNK pathway which upregulates YY1. This causes increased
  YY1 binding to the PD-L1 promoter and an increase in PD-L1 expression. This interaction
  leads to cancer progression and T-cell exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.
  The red and blue lines represent the DNA helix'
