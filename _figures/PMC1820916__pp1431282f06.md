caption: Hypothetical model to explain the role of GSNOR in incompatible interactions
  and SAR. Pathogen recognition initiates H2O2 and NO bursts by activation of NADPH
  and iNOS, respectively. NO, H2O2, and SA act synergistically in triggering HR and
  other defense responses (; ). Different branches, which are SA dependent or independent,
  and mediated or not by NPR1, lead to amplification of the initial signal and effective
  activation of downstream defense responses (; ; ; ). Key regulators of NO and GSNO
  levels, which are mutually influenced, are the enzymes involved in NO synthesis
  and in GSNO catabolism, respectively (; ). Whereas it is well established that GSNO
  acts as an NO donor, the role of GSNO as a NO sink is controversial and it is still
  unknown if GSNO acts as a NO donor in these processes, or if it is a bioactive molecule
  in itself. GSNOR activity is the main regulator of intracellular GSNO and SNO levels
  as well (; this work), with an emerging pivotal role in regulating important processes
  such as plant resistance or the ethylene pathway (). We propose that down-regulation
  of GSNOR, with its concomitant increments of intracellular SNO levels enhances plant
  immunity. Maintaining appropriate levels of GSNO is also important for SAR. There
  is no induction of iNOS in the systemic leaves after challenging the plants with
  avirulent bacteria, but SNO levels rise in those tissues and this is concomitant
  with SAR establishment. GSNOR might have a key role in the regulation of SNO levels
  in the systemic leaves, either because GSNO is the phloem-mobile signal for SAR
  activation and/or because the mobile signal down-regulates GSNOR in the systemic
  leaves, slowing down GSNO breakdown. In favor of the first hypothesis, there is
  evidence that GSNOR localizes into the phloem, and could regulate signal transport.
  However, both hypotheses are not exclusive; for instance, down-regulation of GSNOR
  gene after wounding, both at local and systemic leaves, has been reported ().
