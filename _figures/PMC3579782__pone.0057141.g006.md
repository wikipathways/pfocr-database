caption: 1. In response to increase workload, the SRF mediated IL-6 increasing production
  leads to satellite cells proliferation and first preferentially activate the JAK1/STAT1/STAT3
  pathway leading to the rebuilt of the Pax7(+)/MyoD(−) pool. Like the Notch activity
  for the maintenance of the Pax7(+) SCs, the mitogen activated protein kinase Erk1/2
  cooperates with the JAK1/STAT1/STAT3 pathway to repress early myogenic differentiation.
  2. Later, the decreased Notch activity, the activation of the JAK2/STAT2/STAT3 together
  with multiple pro-differentiating factors (p38, Calcineurin, IGF-1…) activate SCs
  which loose the Pax7 expression (Pax7(−)/MyoD(+)) and start to differentiate. At
  this stage, SCs express late MRFs (Myf5, Myogenin) and then fuse to existing myocytes
  leading to hypertrophy.
