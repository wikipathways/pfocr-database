caption: 'JA biosynthesis and signaling pathway. (A) A simplified JA biosynthesis
  pathway from α-linolenic acid (α-LeA). JA and its derivatives are produced from
  α-LeA through several sequential steps, which are catalyzed by lipoxygenase (LOX),
  allene oxide synthase (AOS), and allene oxide cyclase (AOC) in plastids; OPDA reductase
  (OPR) in peroxisomes; and jasmonate-amido synthetase (JAR1) and jasmonate methyl
  transferase (JMT) in the cytoplasm. (B) A simplified JA signaling pathway. Three
  main components are involved in JA signaling: the COI receptor, the JAZ repressor,
  and the MYC2 transcription factor'
