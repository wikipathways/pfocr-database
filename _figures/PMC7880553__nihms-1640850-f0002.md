caption: 'Figure 2A displays magnitude and significance in linear models of associations
  with four key parameters reflecting myocardial phenotypes, vascular phenotypes,
  and fitness (Year 25 coronary calcification [Y25 CAC]; Year 20 exercise tolerance
  time [Y20 ETT]; Year 25 echocardiographic left ventricular mass by M-mode [Y25 MM
  LV Mass, indexed as described]; Year 25 global longitudinal strain). Associations
  for both HILIC and C8 metabolite modes displayed. Beta coefficients displayed here
  are adjusted for age, sex and race. Red dots signify metabolites statistically significant
  at a 5% false discovery rate (Benjamini-Hochberg). Of note, metabolites associated
  with greater strain (positive beta coefficient), greater LV mass, greater calcification,
  and lower exercise duration (negative beta coefficient) are unfavorable. For example,
  glutamate was associated with adverse phenotypes across four phenotypes. The full
  set of associations across the full range of the measured cardiovascular phenome
  are tabulated in . Figure 2B displays a Venn diagram of metabolites significantly
  associated with four groups of phenotypes: fitness (treadmill time), vascular calcification
  (ln(CAC + 1) at year 25 or ln(AAC + 1) at year 25), LV mass (by either 2D or M-mode)
  and LV strain (longitudinal or circumferential).“Vascular Ca.” indicates vascular
  calcification. Figure 2C display the results of pathway analysis. Figure 2C shows
  set analysis of enriched pathways from 6 sets of HILIC metabolite-linked genes.
  The heatmap color gradient is based on the -log10(empirically determined FDR value)
  of the pathway analysis results for the genes linked to each of the HILIC metabolites
  sets (columns).'
