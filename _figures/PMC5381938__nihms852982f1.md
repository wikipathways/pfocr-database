caption: The nature of recognized tumour antigens, immune cell migration into tumours
  and the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and ligands all provide opportunities
  for biomarker development. CD8+ T effector (Teff) cells are thought to be the major
  type of immune cell affected by the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) immunosuppressive
  checkpoint pathway. In contrast, cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA4)
  predominantly regulates the activity of CD4+ T cells, both effector and regulatory
  (Treg) subtypes. Priming of T cells requires their recognition of processed tumour
  antigens presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as monocytes and dendritic
  cells, through a unique T cell receptor (TCR) that binds to a major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC) molecule and tumour-derived peptide antigens. Such antigens may be
  generated from mutant or non-mutated tumour-associated proteins. Priming of T cells
  generally occurs in lymphoid tissue and CD4+ T cells provide help for CD8+ T cell
  priming in the form of cytokines. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are then activated
  through co-stimulatory pathways such as CD28 B7-1 (also known as CD80) and CD28
  B7-2 (also known as CD86), causing them to proliferate, secrete inflammatory cytokines,
  acquire cytolytic properties and migrate to sites of antigen display, that is, tumour
  deposits. CTLA4 has a major role in regulating the amplitude of CD4+ T cell priming
  and CD4+ T cell help for CD8+ T cell priming in lymphoid tissue. Within hours to
  days, activated T cells also begin to express the co-inhibitory receptor PD1. CD4+
  T helper 1 (TH1) cells and CD8+ T cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME) produce
  interferon-γ (IFNγ), which, on the one hand, activates tumour killing by macrophages
  and antigen display by tumour cells, but, on the other hand, induces PDL1 expression
  by these same macrophages and tumour cells. Tumour-specific PD1+ CD8+ T cells encountering
  PDL1+ cells within the TME (tumour or stromal cells) will be functionally disabled.
  Additionally, CTLA4 expressed by Treg cells in the TME enhances their ability to
  suppress CD8+ T cell-dependent cytokine production and direct tumour cell killing.
  Drugs blocking the immune checkpoints CTLA4, PD1 and PDL1 interrupt these immunosuppressive
  interactions and restore the ability of T cells to eliminate antigen-expressing
  cancer cells.
