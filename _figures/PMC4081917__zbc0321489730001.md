caption: Biosynthesis of C55-P and cell wall peptidoglycan in E. coli. UppS synthesizes
  C55-PP, which is dephosphorylated to monophosphate C55-P by the phosphatase BacA/UppP.
  Subsequently, the sugars-pentapeptide are transferred to C55-P by the enzymes MraY
  and MurG producing lipid I and lipid II, respectively. Lipid II is then translocated
  to the periplasm via flippase (FtsW) for peptidoglycan assembly by the penicillin-binding
  proteins (PBPs). Finally, the peptidoglycan is transferred to the peptidoglycan
  chain, and the C55-P is flipped back to the cytoplasm to repeat the cycle after
  being dephosphorylated by enzymes YbjG, PgpB, or YeiU. The blue question mark denotes
  that it is currently unknown how the dephosphorylated periplasmic C55-P molecules
  return to the cytoplasm in the recycling pathway. The red question mark denotes
  that the function of BacA/UppP in the cytosolic compartment or periplasmic space
  is still unclear. Cell wall active antibiotics are as follows. Bacitracin forms
  a metal-dependent complex with C55-PP and inhibits its dephosphorylation. Tunicamycin
  inhibits the transfer of peptidoglycan precursor (phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide) to
  the C55-PP. Vancomycin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to the two d-Ala
  residues on the end of the pentapeptide chains. Penicillin and moenomycin A (MmA)
  inhibit the penicillin-binding proteins.
