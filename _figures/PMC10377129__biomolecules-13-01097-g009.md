caption: 'The mechanisms of estrogen–succinate–heme metabolism in uterine endometrial
  cancer. (1) Estrogen can inhibit SDHB expression through the PPARγ-SP1-UBC pathway,
  promoting the accumulation of succinate in UEC. The abnormal accumulation of succinate
  promotes heme synthesis and upregulates ER levels, especially those of ERβ. (2)
  Estrogen activates the expression of NCOA1 mainly through ERβ, increasing the synthesis
  of ALAS1. (3) Glycine can be transported into the mitochondria under the mediation
  of SLC25A38 and eventually participate in heme biosynthesis. Estrogen and succinate
  synergistically increase the accumulation of free heme, which promotes the proliferation
  and invasiveness of cells, accelerating the progression of UEC. SDHB: succinate
  dehydrogenase B; PPARγ: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; SP1: specificity
  protein 1; UBC: ubiquitin C; UEC: uterine endometrial cancer; ER: estrogen receptor;
  NCOA1: nuclear receptor coactivator 1; ALAS1: aminolevulinate delta synthase 1;
  SLC25A38: solute carrier family 25 A38.'
