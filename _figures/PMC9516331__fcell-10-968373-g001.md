caption: Genomic and non-genomic estrogen signaling. In the genomic pathway, estrogens
  diffuse across the plasma membrane and bind to estrogen receptors (ER). ERs heterodimerize
  and translocate to the nucleus, inducing the transcription of estrogen response
  element-associated genes. The non-genomic pathway is characterized by a rapid response,
  which modulates cellular enzyme activity and thus, directly affects cell function.
  In this pathway, estrogens bind to ERs associated to caveolae, mainly modulating
  endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. They also can bind to G-protein
  coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) located at the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum,
  to regulate signaling through eNOS, protein kinase A (PKA), and extracellular signal-regulated
  kinases (ERK), also known as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK).
