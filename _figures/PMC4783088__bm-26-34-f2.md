caption: 'Regulation of hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP) expression.   Iron abundance (high Fe) induces bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) binding to their
  receptor (BMP-R) and SMAD-mediated induction of HAMP. Membrane hemojuvelin (mHJV)
  is a BMP co-receptor. Matriptase-2 (MT-2) is active in iron deficiency and hypoxia,
  inhibits BMP signal transmission. Solubile hemojuvelin (sHJV) is cleaved from HJV
  by furine convertase or type II transmembrane serin protease TMPRSS6. It competes
  with sHJV in BMP and has a negative effect on BMP signal transmission. High iron
  concentration causes binding of transferring-iron complex (TR-Fe) to transferrin
  receptor 1 (TfR1). This binding displaces hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE)
  and signals HAMP induction, through interaction with transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2)
  and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) signal pathway.   Inflammation stimulates hepcidin production trough two mediators, interleukin-6
  (IL-6) and activin B. IL-6 binds to IL-6 receptor (IL-6-R) on hepatocyte and activates
  Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT 3)
  signal pathway. Activin B binds to BMP-R and activates SMADs. Both inflammatory
  mediators have a positive effect on HAMP expression. Anemia causes an increase in
  production of erythropoietin that binds to erythropoietin receptor (EPO-R) and down-regulates
  expression of signaling protein CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and hepcidin.
  The mechanisms of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), growth differentiation factor
  15 (GDF15) and twisted gastrulation (TWSG) as HAMP modulators is still controversial.'
