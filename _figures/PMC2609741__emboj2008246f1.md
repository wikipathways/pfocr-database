caption: Biosynthesis pathways for s2T and other sulphur-containing cofactors. (A)
  Biosynthesis of 2-thioribothymidine (s2T) from ribothymidine (rT). We identified
  a new biosynthetic gene, TtuC. The requirement for other proteins or cofactors remains
  to be investigated. (B) Chemical structures of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) and thiamin.
  The molybdopterin (MPT) of Moco and the hydroxyethylthiazole (HET) moiety of thiamin
  are boxed by dotted lines. (C) Comparison of the biosynthesis pathways of sulphur-containing
  molecules (a–c) and the eukaryote-specific ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation system (d).
  In Moco synthesis (a), a thiocarboxylate (MoaD-COSH) serves as sulphur donor. Although
  cysteine desulphurases provide the sulphur atom for MoaD-COSH in E. coli, the in
  vivo sulphur source for MoaD-COSH has not been clarified in humans. In thiamin synthesis
  (b), a thiocarboxylate (ThiS-COSH) serves as the sulphur donor. An acyl–disulphide
  complex of ThiS–ThiF was detected in the E. coli pathway. In s2T synthesis (c),
  we analysed three steps and the intermediates in this study. In the Ub system (d),
  Ub-E1 thioester is formed as an important intermediate. The characteristic intermediates
  are boxed.
