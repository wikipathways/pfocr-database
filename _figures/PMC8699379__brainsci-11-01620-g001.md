caption: 'General proposed pathway influenced by various factors. Physiological concepts
  are applied to formulate the pathway. The proposed mechanism where the COVID-19
  pandemic has caused quarantine response: social isolation conditions have a number
  of health issues associated with stress (highlighted in blue). Loneliness may be
  induced by social isolation, or make an existing loneliness condition worse, and
  is also associated with stress (highlighted in blue). Pre-pandemic factors also
  play a role (highlighted in brown). The resulting stress is associated with a cascade
  of events (highlighted in purple), ending with a link to generalized anxiety.'
