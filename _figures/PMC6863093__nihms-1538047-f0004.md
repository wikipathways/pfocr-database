caption: A. HVEM associates with LIGHT, LTα, BTLA, and CD160 in trimeric confirmations
  when expressed in trans confirmation. LIGHT and LTα associated with CRD1 binding
  domain, while BTLA and CD160 associate with CRD2/3. All ligands associate with HVEM
  in a trimeric confirmation, generating a 3:3:3 complex of 3 HVEM molecules with
  3 BTLA or CD160 molecules and 3 LIGHT or LTα molecules. B. HVEM interacts with coexpressed
  BTLA to from an inert complex when both are expressed in their cis confirmation,
  most commonly on naÏve T-cells. In this formation HVEM can still associate with
  soluble LIGHT or LTα at its exposed CRD1 binding domain, yet no downstream signal
  is generated from the interaction. C. When HVEM is expressed in the trans confirmation
  on the membrane, ligation of LIGHT, LTα, BTLA or CD160 results in TRAF2 recruitment
  within the HVEM expressing cell. TRAF2 activates an IKK complex which in turn activates
  the RelA form of NFκB to promote cell survival. Within BTLA and CD160 expressing
  cells, ligation of HVEM results ITIM phosphorylation, recruiting SHP1 and SHP2,
  ultimately resulting in inhibitory signaling interrupting TCR signal transduction
  via dephosphorylation of PI3k -PKB pathway. Despite apparent absence of intracellular
  signaling motifs, LIGHT ligation of HVEM stimulates CD8+ T-cell expansion.
