caption: Mechanisms of gap filling. A replication fork block leads to Rad6/Rad18-dependent
  PCNA monoubiquitination (A), which targets a specialized polymerase able to insert
  a correct or incorrect nucleotide opposite the lesion (translesion synthesis) (B).
  Alternatively, Rad51 and Rad5 can promote ssDNA gap filling by a mechanism that
  employs the intact sister chromatid to circumvent the lesion through the formation
  and subsequent dissolution of hemicatenanes (C–H). Hemicatenane formation requires
  the ssDNA binding complex replication protein A (RPA), the recombination proteins
  Rad51, Rad52, Rad55, Rad57, the Shu complex, Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of
  Rad55, Rad54, the nuclease Exo1, the polyubiquitin ligase activity of Rad5, the
  DNA bending activity of the high mobility group protein Hmo1, the cyclin-dependent
  kinase Cdc28, and Pol δ, but neither Pol ε nor the TLS polymerases. Dissolution
  of hemicatenanes requires the Sgs1/Top3/Rmi1 complex together with Ubc9/Mms21-dependent
  sumoylation of the DNA repair Smc5-6 complex. An alternative, Rad5-independent,
  Rad17/Mec3/Ddc1-dependent salvage HR pathway, which is inhibited in S phase by sumoPCNA-dependent
  recruitment of Srs2, might be operating through the formation and further resolution
  of HJs (C–I). See text for more details. * It should be noted that Rad51-strand
  invasion does not require PCNA monoubiquitination.
