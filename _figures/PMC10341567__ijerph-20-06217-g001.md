caption: Overview of the main pathways involved in cholesterol transport involved
  in Alzheimer’s Disease. Although not directly illustrated, SREBP2 is activated by
  GSK3B through the Akt pathway. De novo synthesis is indicated by Pathway 1, where
  SREBP2 and SCAP bind to each other and transport cholesterol from the ER to the
  Golgi apparatus. The SREBP2/SCAP complex activates SREBP2, which is involved in
  cholesterol synthesis in Pathway 2. Through Pathway 3, ABCA1 transports cholesterol
  to ApoE, which then transports the cholesterol to LRP1 to become synthesized in
  the neuron by Pathway 4. Pathways 5 and 6 demonstrate CYP46A1 converting excess
  cholesterol into 24S-OHC and then being exported from the neuron, which then crosses
  the Blood Brain Barrier through Pathway 7. Through Pathway 8, BACE1 cleaves APP
  to produce amyloid-beta plaques. When cholesterol is transported to the microglia
  via Pathway 9, TREM2 aids in cholesterol efflux out of the brain
