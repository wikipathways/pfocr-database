caption: Non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) On ligand binding, receptors crosslink
  and the TRAF2:TRAF3:CIAP1/2 complex is recruited to the receptors. TRAF2 ubiquitinates
  cIAP1 and cIAP2, which then ubiquitinate TRAF3 (and TRAF2 to some extent) and stimulate
  its rapid degradation. NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) is released. TPL2 physically
  assembles with IKK and NIK and phosphorylates NIK which then phosphorylates and
  activates IKKα. TPL2 also activates IKKα. IKKα phosphorylates p100. Once phosphorylated,
  p100 is degraded by the proteasome and p52 is released and can dimerize and translocate
  to the nucleus. (B) Dimerization of TRAF3 with TRAF2 allows recruitment of the CIAPs1/2
  ubiquitin ligases, Normally, NIK is bound by this complex and targeted for constant
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. P, phosphate; U, ubiquitin.
