caption: A depiction of the MAPK signaling pathway in the KEGG database. (A) We represented
  proteins or associated complexes that were encoded by PSD risk-related genes with
  a blue background, whereas we used red characters to represent the respective genes
  that encode them and that also contained miRNA target genes composed of miRSNPs
  located within their 3′-UTR regions. (B) Diagram of the schematics of the miRSNP–miRNA–gene–pathway
  axis. We used red lettering to represent high-risk genes and used blue circle to
  indicate their respectively identified regulatory miRNAs. We identified links between
  them seen in the connecting lines and which are indicative of the dynamics of regulatory
  influences of miRNAs upon the genes. The symbol representative of the switch is
  located upon the line showing the trend for mean values of the miRSNPs. We used
  the relatively large-sized circles on the peripheral in order to help denote the
  pathways miRSNPs that may have had important influences by way of their observed
  effects upon the ability of miRNAs to regulate target genes. We used orange-colored
  stars placed below miRNAs in order to represent the literature that reported miRNAs
  that have been characterized to significantly influence the regulation of target
  genes.
