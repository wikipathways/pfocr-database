caption: 'Interplay between innate immunity and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Double-stranded
  (ds) HEV RNA is detected in the cytoplasm by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)
  and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), leading to type I and
  type III interferon (IFN) production. TLR3 detects HEV RNA in the endosomal compartment.
  The protease domain (Pro) of the ORF1 protein inhibits signaling via RIG-I and prevents
  IFN induction by removing ubiquitin from RIG-I and TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK-1).
  Pro and Met can also interfere with the MDA5 signaling pathway. The methyltransferase
  domain (Met) also acts on RIG-I to reduce IFN production, and interferes with ferritin
  secretion to decrease the inflammatory response. The X domain (X) and the capsid
  protein ORF2 inhibit the phosphorylation (P) of IFN regulatory protein 3 (IRF3).
  Conversely, the ORF3 protein stimulates the direct production of type I IFN via
  RIG-I, while ORF3 interferes with TLR3 synthesis. ORF3 and part of ORF1 (methyltransferase
  + Y domain + Protease: Met-Y-Pro) also bind to STAT1 to restrict its phosphorylation
  and the activation of the downstream cascade, thus inhibiting IFN-stimulated gene
  (ISG) expression, including that of “interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide
  repeats 1” (IFIT1) and ISG15. Abbreviations include IKKε: IκB-kinase-epsilon; IRF3,
  7 or 9: IFN regulatory protein 3, 7 or 9; ISRE: interferon-stimulated response element;
  MAVS: mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein; STAT1 or 2: signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 1 or 2; and Ub: ubiquitin.'
