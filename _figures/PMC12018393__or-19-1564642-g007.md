caption: Raloxifene metabolic pathway. The major metabolite of raloxifene, raloxifene-4′-β-glucuronide
  (raloxifene-4′-gluc), is highlighted in red. Another metabolite, raloxifene-6-β-glucuronide
  (raloxifene-6-gluc), is also shown. Raloxifene undergoes extensive first-pass glucuronidation
  into its metabolites upon gastrointestinal tract absorption. The 1A UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
  (UGT) enzyme family are involved in raloxifene metabolism. Raloxifene is converted
  to raloxifene-4′-gluc metabolite mainly through intestinal UGT1A10 and UGT1A8 enzymes.
  The conversion of raloxifene to raloxifene-6-gluc occurs primarily via hepatic UGT1A1.
  The UGT1A9 enzyme has been found to play a minor role in catalyzing the formation
  of both raloxifene-4′-gluc and raloxifene-6-gluc (131–135)
