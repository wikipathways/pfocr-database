caption: The signalling pathway was discovered in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) after
  Sal B treatment. Sal B induces miR-152 up-regulation, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)
  down-regulation, DNA demethylation and gene expression of Patched1 (PTCH1), and
  results in the suppression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover,
  activated HSCs contribute to DNA methylation of PTCH1.

  DNMT1-mediated Patched1 methylation.
