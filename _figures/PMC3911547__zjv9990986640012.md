caption: Schematic diagram depicting the diverse outcomes of KSHV-induced 5LO and
  LTB4 in ECs and the consequences and roles of KSHV in viral pathogenesis. In vitro
  KSHV infection of HMVEC-d involves binding of the virus to cell surface heparan
  sulfate (HS) molecules via its envelope glycoproteins, followed by interaction with
  integrins and cystine transporter (xCT) molecules (). Virus interaction with target
  cell triggers preexisting signal cascades facilitating virus entry and delivery
  of the viral genome into the target cell nucleus and reprograms the host gene expression
  required for various growth, angiogenic, and invasive factors (). Data presented
  here show 5LO being one of the host factors upregulated during later time points
  of de novo KSHV infection of ECs. We also observed high 5LO and LTA4H gene expression
  in TIVE-LTC cells, PEL cells, human KS lesions, and PEL tissue sections. We show
  that in infected cells, 5LO, along with FLAP, catalyzes the synthesis of LTB4 from
  LTA4 utilizing the LTA4H enzyme. LTB4 is released to the infected cell supernatant,
  where it can mediate its downstream effects through either an autocrine or a paracrine
  mechanism on a neighboring infected or uninfected cell via interaction through the
  family of highly conserved seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled rhodopsin-type
  LTB4R (LTB4R1 [BLT1] and LTB4R2 [BLT2]) receptors. The KSHV-induced 5LO/LTB4 cascade
  regulates multiple events involved in KS pathogenesis, such as the balance of TH1/TH2
  cytokines, monocyte recruitment, adhesion, and transmigration. Interestingly, our
  study demonstrated that the LTB4 released into the infected cell microenvironment
  induces the FASN promoter and its gene expression to enhance lipogenesis, another
  pathway to promote viral latency, in the infected cells. In summary, together with
  the downregulation of viral K5, vMIP-1, and vMIP-2 gene expression upon 5LO/LTB4
  inhibition, our study suggests that KSHV hijacks the host cellular machinery and
  manipulates the 5-lipoxygenase/LTB4 pathway to its advantage to aggravate pathogenesis
  and lipogenesis and its persistence in the target cell. Green arrows facing up,
