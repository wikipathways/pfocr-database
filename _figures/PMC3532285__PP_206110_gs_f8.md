caption: Genetic model showing the location of LNP in the nodulation signaling pathway
  in root hairs. Based on the lack of Nod factor-induced calcium influx in the LNP
  antisense line and the retention of root hair deformation by Nod factor and M. loti,
  LNP is proposed to act upstream of SYMRK (mutation of SYMRK did not block calcium
  influx) but downstream of the Nod factor receptors NFR1 and NFR5, possibly influencing
  their output. TFs, Transcription factors. The model is modified from that described
  previously (); the ion channel genes are CASTOR and POLLUX, and the nucleoporin
  genes are NUP133, NUP8, and NENA, as described in the text. The solid lines indicate
  the proposed genetic pathway, and the broken lines show the induced phenotypes.
