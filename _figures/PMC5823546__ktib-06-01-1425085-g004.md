caption: Mechanism(s) of action of curcumin in systemic LPS levels. Oral supplementation
  with curcumin increases the activity of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) enhancing
  luminal deactivation of LPS. De-phospho LPS acts as a TLR4 antagonist further reducing
  LPS-TLR4 interaction and downstream signaling resulting in reduced secretion of
  pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. As a result LPS or IL-1β mediated activation of
  MAPK and subsequent phosphorylation and expression of tight junction proteins is
  attenuated. These modulatory effects of curcumin prevent the disruption of tight
  junction organization and decrease LPS-mediated increase in paracellular permeability.
  Additionally, curcumin is taken up by the intestinal epithelial cells and via binding
  to the vitamin D receptor initiates intracellular signaling events leading to an
  increase in the expression of tight junction proteins that reduce paracellular permeability.
  Luminal LPS is also translocated bound to chylomicrons and curcumin decreases cholesterol
  absorption by reducing the expression of apical cholesterol transporter NPC1L1 resulting
  in attenuated chylomicron secretion. This pathway may represent yet another mechanism
  by which curcumin can decrease systemic LPS levels. All events negatively or positively
  regulated by curcumin are indicated by “-“ or “+” sign in the green circles, respectively.
