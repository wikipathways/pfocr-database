caption: The cGAS-STING pathway in bacterial infection. The cGAS-STING pathway is
  widely involved in various bacterial infections. However, the signaling transduction
  process and outcome upon the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway are different.
  STING is activated by 2’3’-cGAMP produced by cGAS or bacterial CDNs to induce an
  IFN-I response that may be protective or detrimental for the host. STING can also
  influence the infection outcome by mediating other important biological or physiological
  processes like blood coagulation or metabolism independent of IFN-I response.
