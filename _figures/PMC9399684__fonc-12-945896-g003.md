caption: Ion channels develop resistance to chemo-therapy involving cell metabolism.
  Over-expression of TRPC5 leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ which facilitates
  the translocation of β-catenin into the nucleus, and induces ABCB1 (MDR1) expression,
  potentiating resistance to 5-Fu in HCT-8/5-Fu cells. Up-regulated TRPC5 in human
  colorectal cancer cells activates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which has
  been shown to induce GLUT1 expression through its target gene c-Myc, thus exacerbating
  chemo-resistance. Using glycolysis inhibitor of 2DG can significantly increase the
  level of cleaved Caspase-3 in HCT-8/5-FU cells, thereby inducing apoptosis and reverse
  chemo-resistance. ABCB1, ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 1; GLUT, glucose
  transporter; 5-Fu, 5-Fluorouracil; 3-BP, 3-bromopyruvate; 2DG, 2-Deoxy-D-glucose;
