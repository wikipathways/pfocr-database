caption: Hallmarks of senescent CD4+CD28− T lymphocytes. In contrast to their non-senescent
  counterpart, senescent CD4+CD28− T lymphocytes show activation of the DNA damage
  response (DDR) by ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and phosphorylation of H2A
  histone family member X (γ-H2AX). ATM signaling in these cells leads to phosphorylation
  of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and subsequently through a sestrin-mediated
  signaling pathway to p38 MAPK. Senescent CD4+CD28− T lymphocytes also show increased
  secretion of pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic mediators attributed to a senescence-associated
  secretory phenotype (SASP) and upregulated cell cycle inhibitors, such as p16ink4a,
  that block cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S phase. In addition, they
  have lysosomal dysfunction, as evidenced by increased senescence-associated-β-galactosidase
  (SA-βgal) activity, and are highly resistant to apoptosis by upregulating anti-apoptotic
  proteins such as Bcl-2 and cellular Flice-inhibitory protein (c-Flip).
