caption: The domain structure of human CaMKK2 showing the positions of the regulatory
  phosphorylation sites. Autophosphorylation of Thr85 and Thr486 enhance CaMKK2 activity.
  In the S3-node, phosphorylation of Ser137 by CDK5 primes CaMKK2 for subsequent phosphorylation
  on Ser133 and Ser129 by GSK3, which decreases CaMKK2 activity. Phosphorylation of
  Ser100, Ser495 and Ser511 by PKA blocks CaMKK2 activation by Ca2+-calmodulin, and
  promotes the binding of 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, which keep CaMKK2 in an inactive
  state
