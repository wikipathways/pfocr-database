caption: A During resting, approximately 2–5% of cellular glucose enters the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway (HBP) to generate the end product UDP-GlcNAc. B During adaptation,
  high glucose induces genome instability through O-linked-N-acetylglucosaminylation
  (O-GlcNAcylation) of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) and ribonucleotide reductase catalytic
  subunit M1 (RRM1) to direct glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) into
  the HBP. C During hyperproliferation, such as in pancreatic cancer cells, both high
  glucose and high glutamine are required through overactivation/overexpression of
  PFK1, shunting glycolysis into the PPP and HBP to generate energy and biosynthesis
  precursors to meet the needs of cancer cells. G6P glucose 6-phosphate, F6P fructose
  6-phosphate, FBP fructose 1,6-phosphate, GFAT glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase,
  R5P ribose 5-phosphate, PRPP phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, NDP nucleoside diphosphate,
  dNDP deoxynucleoside diphosphates, GlcN6P glucosamine-6-phosphate, UDP-GlcNAc uridine
  diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine.
