caption: Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes composed of several domains with
  distinct functions. They are activated upon detecting various danger signals, such
  as pathogen toxins, nucleic acids, secretion systems, changes in cellular structures,
  metabolic alterations, ionic disturbances, and organelle damage. The PYD domain
  of inflammasomes interacts with the adaptor protein ASC, facilitating the assembly
  of the inflammasome complex. Subsequently, the CARD domain of ASC recruits pro-caspase-1
  to form the complex. In the canonical signaling pathway, inflammasome activation
  results in the self-cleavage and activation of caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then
  cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature, biologically active forms. Additionally,
  it cleaves GSDMD, generating its active N-terminal domain, which oligomerizes to
  form stable pores in the plasma membrane. This pore formation induces cell swelling
  and rupture, leading to inflammatory cell death and the release of intracellular
  substances such as IL-1β, IL-18, HMGB1, and LDH. In the non-canonical signaling
  pathway, LPS directly binds to the CARD domain of caspase-4/5/11, resulting in the
  cleavage of GSDMD. However, GSDMD requires NLRP3 activation to cleave pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18
