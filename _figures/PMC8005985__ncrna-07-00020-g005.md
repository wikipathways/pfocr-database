caption: The regulatory function of main lncRNAs related to cardiomyocyte maturation.
  (A) Zfas1 and Dach1 manipulate the cardiac function by regulating Ca2+ homeostasis,
  proliferation and apoptosis in mature cardiomyocytes. This happened through negative
  regulation of Serca2a through either its expression repression or functional restriction
  and regulating the Hippo signaling pathway. (B) Carl and Mdrl-lncRNAs regulate mitochondrial
  fission and apoptosis through regulating the combination of miRNAs and transcription
  factors in adult cardiomyocytes. Carl lncRNA sponges miR-539 in the cardiomyocytes,
  which in turn upregulates the expression of Phb2 as its target gene. Mdrl-lncRNA
  has direct interaction with miR-361 and downregulates its expression levels, which
  in turn promotes the processing of pri-miR-484 and represses the Fis1 expression.
  (C) Cpr lncRNA attenuates the cardiomyocyte proliferation in postnatal and adult
  hearts through direct interaction and recruitment of DNMT3A protein Mcm3 promoter
  to repress its expression. Sarrah lncRNA regulates cardiomyocyte survival and enhances
  the contractile capacity of adult cardiomyocytes through activating the NRF2 signaling
  pathway. Sarrah directly binds to the promoter region of the Nrf2 gene through RNA-DNA
  triple helix formation and recruits CRIP2 and p300 transcription factors to induce
  its expression. More details are described within the text.
