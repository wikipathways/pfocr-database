caption: 'Main metabolic pathway in the bioactivation and DNA adduct formation of
  BaP in lung. See text for details. CYP, cytochrome P450; mEH, microsomal epoxide
  hydrolase; MPO, myleoperoxidase. Inserts: autoradiographic profiles of DNA adducts
  in lungs formed in mice; the origin, at the bottom left-hand corner, was cut off
  before exposure. Autoradiographic profiles in the lungs are representative of those
  observed in the livers. The arrow shows 10-(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl)-7,8,9-trihydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-BaP
  (dG-N2-BPDE).'
