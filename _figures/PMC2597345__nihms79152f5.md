caption: Possible scheme for ES cell differentiation and the role of specific factors
  in the formation of primitive ectoderm and primary germ layers. A hypothetical primitive
  streak consisting of both posterior and anterior populations is shown, the populations
  of which are based on information from mouse. FGF is shown to play a role in neural
  induction; whereas Wnt, BMP, and activin are all implicated as inhibitors of the
  early stages of this pathway. BMP4 functions to induce posterior mesoderm, while
  a gradient of activin/nodal signaling is necessary for other fate decisions. At
  low concentrations of activin, more posterior-like populations are generated; whereas
  at high concentrations, it induces endoderm, consistent with an anterior primitive
  streak-derived population. This figure has been adapted from [].
