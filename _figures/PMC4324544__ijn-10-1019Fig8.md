caption: 'Anti-cancer mechanism of SurR9C84A (SR9).Notes: SR9 leads to competitive
  inhibition of endogenous survivin expression, which further leads to an increase
  in expression of pro-apoptotic proteins compared to anti-apoptotic proteins in the
  cytoplasm, which in turn induces lowering of mitochondrial potential and depolarization
  of mitochondria. Cytochrome-C is released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm,
  which leads to activation of casapse-3 via caspase-9, which in turn leads to apoptosis
  (intrinsic apoptosis pathway). The CHNP–SR9, on the other hand, causes activation
  of extrinsic apoptosis via activation of death receptors (TRAIL, FAS), which induces
  expression of caspase-7 and -8 that lead to apoptosis.Abbreviations: SR9, cell-permeable
  dominant negative survivin SurR9-C84A; CHNP, chitosan nanoparticles; DNA, deoxyribonucleic
  acid; Cyt C, cytochrome-C; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; Cas, caspase; HSPs, heat
  shock protein; Smac, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases.'
