caption: The proposed metabolic shift during biofilm induction in B. cereus. Most
  genes involved in this predicted metabolic pathway were found to be highly upregulated
  under biofilm induction (in LBGM) compared to non-biofilm induction (in LB) based
  on the results of the genome-wide transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq. The genes with
  different colors represent the difference in fold change in differential expression
  (LBGM versus LB). Dark green stands for highest induction, while dark brown stands
  for strongest repression. Numbers next to the gene name in the parentheses represent
  the fold changes in gene expression.
