caption: LF induces autophagy by activating AMPK and inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway.
  Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) causes oxidative stress-induced cell death and apoptosis.
  LF inhibits cell death and apoptosis by augmenting autophagy and reducing caspase-3.
  Folic acid induces kidney fibrosis, and LF prevents that by inhibiting apoptosis
  and inducing autophagy. TGF-β1 induces fibrosis by increasing the expression of
  PAI-1, CTGF, and collagen-1, and LF inhibits fibrosis by decreasing their expression.
  A high fat and salt condition promotes inflammation leading to kidney damage. LF
  inhibits inflammation and protects against kidney damage by reducing inflammatory
  cytokines. AKT, protein kinase B; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; Bax, BCL2
