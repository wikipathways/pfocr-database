caption: 'The synthesis pathways of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and the primary
  role in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. The microbial transformation of dietary
  fiber in the hindgut leads to the synthesis of the SCFA (mainly acetate, propionate
  and butyrate). The acetate is produced from pyruvate by the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
  or W-L pathway. Propionate is formed from deoxyhexose via the propanediol pathway
  or from phosphoenolpyruvate via the succinate pathway or the acrylate pathway. Butyric
  acid is produced by synthesizing two molecules of acetyl-CoA to yield acetyl-CoA,
  then converted to butyryl-CoA by β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA. PST = phosphotransacetylase;
  AK = acetokinase; W-L = Wood-Ljungdahl; ME-COA = methylmalonyl-CoA; PO = pyruvic
  oxidase; PT = phosphotransferase; BK = butyrate kinase; TCA = tricarboxylic acid
  cycle; MVA = mevalonic acid; β-HBA = β-hydroxybutyric acid; HMG-CoA = β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
