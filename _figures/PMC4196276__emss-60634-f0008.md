caption: However, when tested in clinical trials, TNF-alpha inhibiting compounds were
  not effective against GVHD but could later be repositioned for the treatment of
  Rheumatoid Arthritis (focus pathway). Entourage shows Rheumatoid Athritis as closely
  related to the GVHD pathway (see pathway list on the left). Entourage also reveals
  seemingly contradictory roles of TNF-alpha. It is involved in cell death (Apoptosis)
  and also in cancer (i.e., uncontrolled cell growth) through the MAPK signaling pathway.
