caption: tmTNF-α-induced STAT1-dependent apoptotic signaling via TNFR1. sTNF-α induces
  binding of TRADD to the DD of TNFR1. TNFR1-bound TRADD further recruits TRAF2 and
  cIAP1/2 at the plasma membrane to activate NF-κB pathway. However, after TNFR1 internalization,
  STAT1 binds to TRADD and is phosphorylated at tyrosine 701, which excludes the binding
  of TRAF2 and cIAP1 to TRADD and attenuates NF-κB activation. Meanwhile, TRADD recruits
  FADD and caspase 8 to form DISC in the cytoplasm to mediate apoptosis. In contrast,
  tmTNF-α induces binding of STAT1 to the SD of TNFR1 and STAT1 serine phosphorylation
  at 727. The S727 phosphorylated STAT1 further recruits TRADD to form DISC at the
  plasma membrane to trigger apoptosis, but not NF-κB activation
