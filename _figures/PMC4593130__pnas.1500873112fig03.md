caption: Comparisons between phosphonocystoximic acid and hydroxynitrilaphos biosynthesis.
  (A) Putative gene clusters. The majority of genes are shared between the two pathways,
  with some notable differences. Genes for α-ketoglutarate–dependent dioxygenase (magenta)
  and PnPy decarboxylase (purple) are absent from the phosphonocystoximate gene cluster,
  which instead contains a gene for pyridoxamine-phosphate oxidase (yellow). Half
  of the shared genes encoding the two pathways are inverted relative to each other.
  Other labeled genes putatively encode for PepM (red), mycothiol transferase (blue,
  outlined in red), N-hydroxylase (green), and peptidases (brown). (B) Proposed biosynthetic
  pathways for phosphonocystoximic acids and cyanomethylphosphonic acids. (C) Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway for glucosinolates, adapted from Halkier and Gershenzon ().
  Several intermediates in glucosinolate biosynthesis and metabolism share similarities
  to the compounds from these pathways. Glutathione is the source of Cys (orange)
  in glucosinolate biosynthesis, whereas mycothiol (orange and blue) may contribute
  N-acetylcysteine in phosphonocystoximic acid biosynthesis.
