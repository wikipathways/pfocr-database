caption: 'Prototypical TCS signaling pathway. A variety of extracellular signals are
  detected by the SD, which triggers the membrane-bound HK dimerization. The TM helices
  form four-helix bundles in the HK dimeric states. The signaling mechanism then involves
  the autophosphorylation of HK mediated by hydrolysis of ATP and concomitant phosphorylation
  of a conserved histidine by the catalytic (CA) domain. This then leads to the phosphotransfer
  of the HK phosphoryl group to a cytoplasmatic response regulator (RR) that is composed
  by two domains: the receiver domain (D)—that recognizes and binds to the HK domain—and
  the effector DNA-binding domain (DBD) that modulates the expression of target genes
  and hence the cellular response. Upon phosphorylation, the RR is activated and undergoes
  conformational changes that promote dimerization or more ordered oligomerization
  states that favor the interaction between the RR and bacterial DNA. Alternatively,
  the RR may also act as an enzyme, such as a methylesterase or an ATPase. TCS signaling
  is terminated by dephosphorylation of the RR, which can be auto induced or mediated
  by the HK or by auxiliary proteins. The CA and the dimerization domains are conserved
  and found in all HK, whereas the remaining signaling domains (HAMP, GAF, PAS and
  PHY) are variable.'
