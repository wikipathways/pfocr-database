caption: Overview of Ber-mediated mitohormesis signaling. Ber mainly accumulated in
  the mitochondria after entering cells through organic cation transporter (OTC1/2)
  or passive diffusion. In mitochondria, Ber could target enzymes and other proteins
  associated with the electron transfer chain or mtDNA to disrupt energy homeostasis
  and induce translation stress. This can induce mitohormetic response via (1) ROS-mediated
  redox pathway, (2) AMP/ATP-induced AMPK pathway, (3) NAD+/NADH-mediated Sirtuins
  pathway (i.e., SIRT1), and (4) UPRmt pathway to regulate and maintain mitochondria
  homeostasis for the ability of cells to adapt to adverse circumstances
