caption: Biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria by the polymerase-dependent
  pathway. Many steps of the complex sequences and controls in the biosynthesis of
  LPS in Gram-negative bacteria are similar to those in mammalian glycoprotein biosynthesis.
  The inner membrane serves as the site of glycan biosynthesis, and the membrane-bound
  acceptor is undecaprenol-phosphate (P-Und) having 11 isoprenyl units, which is less
  than those found in eukaryotic Dol. Nucleotide sugars are synthesized in the cytosol
  and used for most glycosylation reactions. As in the N-glycan biosynthesis, the
  first sugar is transferred as sugar-phosphate by membrane-bound WecA to synthesize
  GalNAc/GlcNAc-PP-Und. This step can also be blocked by tunicamycin. It is possible
  that a 4-epimerase is involved. Subsequently, sugars are added individually to form
  the repeating unit of the O antigen. The glycosyltransferases that transfer sugars
  from nucleotide sugars usually have a high specificity for their donor and acceptor
  substrates and are associated with the membrane. After Wzx transports the repeating
  units to the periplasm, they are polymerized by Wzy by addition of repeating units
  to the reducing end of the growing polysaccharide linked to PP-Dol. The O antigen
  can be further processed and modified to form completed O antigens and the biosynthesis
  is usually terminated with Wzz. The O polysaccharide is then transferred to a sugar
  of the core oligosaccharide linked to lipid A by a ligase, forming the LPS, which
  is exported to the outer membrane by the Lpt complex. The O antigenic polysaccharide
  is then exposed to the environment on the outer membrane. Although many bacterial
  enzymes involved in LPS synthesis have been cloned, the individual steps of LPS
  synthesis are not well understood, mainly because of the major challenge to find
  the appropriate enzyme substrates and conditions to assay enzymes. The example shows
  the biosynthesis of the E. coli O104 antigen. The repeating unit tetrasaccharide
  contains the cancer-associated T antigen (Galβ1-3GalNAc), as well as the sialyl-T
  antigen (sialylα2-3Galβ1-3GalNAc). The WbwA sialyltransferase and the WbwB Gal-transferase
  remain to be characterized.
