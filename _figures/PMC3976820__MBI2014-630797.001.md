caption: Activation and regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway. STAT homodimers or heterodimers
  translocate to the nucleus. Cytokines signal by approximating receptors and associated
  janus kinases (JAKs), initiating a cascade of phosphorylation (P). This results
  in the phosphorylation and dimerisation of STATs, which translocate to the nucleus
  initiating gene transcription. In addition to genes involved in survival, proliferation,
  and function, STATs initiate transcription of SOCS. SOCS inhibits cytokine signaling
  by (1) binding to JAKs and directly inhibiting their kinase activity; (2) blocking
  STAT recruitment to the cytokine receptor; and (3) targeting the receptor or its
  JAK for degradation by the proteasome.
