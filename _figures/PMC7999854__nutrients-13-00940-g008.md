caption: 'OCA-reversed bile acid taurocholate linked disordered serum metabolites
  to anxiety-like behavior in HFHS diet mice. Correlation network exhibited that microbial
  metabolites, including bile acid taurocholate and indole derivatives of tryptophan
  metabolites, linked the metabolic disturbance to anxiety in HFHS diet mice, which
  were improved by OCA supplementation. Note: The serum metabolites are color-coded
  according to the KEGG pathway mapping results, and metabolites marked with black
  color are increased, and white are decreased in HFHS diet mice. Positive correlations
  are illustrated as red lines and negative correlations as green lines. Abbreviations:
  HFHS, high-fat high-sugar; OCA, obeticholic acid; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
  and Genomes.'
