caption: Starvation effects on insulin signaling components and JH synthesis in the
  CA of mosquitoes. This scheme summarizes starvation-related changes of insulin/TOR
  pathway components and JH synthesis. Molecules in red color are downregulated (↓),
  while those in green are upregulated (↑). Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and TOR
  are involved in the transduction of insulin signaling in the CA []. A starvation-dependent
  decrease of insulin results in an increase of FOXO signaling that promotes activation
  of transcription of insulin receptor (INSr) and 4E-binding protein (4EBP). Transcripts
  levels for FOXO increase and mRNAs for JHAMT and TOR decrease. JH synthesis decreases,
  while increases of 4EBP inhibit translation and increases of INSr enhance insulin
  sensitivity, from [].
