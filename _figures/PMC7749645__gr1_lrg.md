caption: Convergent type I interferon and proinflammatory cytokine pathways shared
  between SLE and COVID-19. Binding of viral RNA to toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and
  TLR7 induces activation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 and IRF7, respectively,
  which is mediated by several adaptor proteins. Once active, IRF3 and IRF7 translocate
  to the nucleus and induce transcription of interferon (IFN)-α or IFN-β. TLR7 (and
  TLR8) activation also leads to nuclear translocation of NF-κB and induction of proinflammatory
  cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).
  Binding of IL-17, secreted by Th17 cells, to its receptor (IL-17R) activates the
  adaptor protein NF-κ activator (Act1) and TRAF6, inducing the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB. IL-6 binding to its receptor (IL-6R) activates the phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway, in turn activating the mechanistic target of rapamycin
  complex 1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 mediates phosphorylation of S6K (not shown), which promotes
  the formation of the TLR-MyD88 complex and IRF7-mediated production of type I IFN.
  Activated mTORC1 also stimulates transcription of IRF7 mRNA by a 4E-BP phosphorylation-dependent
  mechanism (dashed arrow), and induces NF-κB activity. Type I IFNs, secreted in an
  autocrine and paracrine matter, bind to the IFN-α/-β receptor (IFNAR), leading to
  assembly and translocation to the nucleus of the interferon-stimulated gene factor
  3 (ISGF3), which is composed of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF9. Once in the nucleus, ISGF3
  binds to promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), stimulating their transcription.
  IRF1 is also induced in response to type I IFN, which activates the transcription
  of proinflammatory cytokines. A red X mark is located next to each component of
  the pathway that is impaired by loss-of-function genetic variants (1–7), autoantibodies
  against type I IFN (8), or SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Act1, adaptor protein NF-κ activator;
