caption: Mechanism of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms caused by various nervous
  system diseases. Multiple sclerosis (MS) cause detrusor overactivity (DO) due to
  the suprapontine lesions, axonal loss, novel C-fiber-mediated voiding reflex, and
  reductions in central serotonergic activity and stress hormones. Neuromyelitis optica
  spectrum disorder (NMOSD) causes DO due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Parkinson’s
  disease (PD) causes DO due to the decline in nigrostriatal dopaminergic function,
  frontal lobe executive impairment and REM sleep behavior disorder, and the reduction
  of several inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain. Multiple system atrophy (MSA)
  causes lesions in locus coeruleus, prefrontal-basal ganglia D1 dopaminergic pathway,
  cerebellum, raphe serotonergic pathway, and frontal cortex. SCI leads to DO due
  to the impaired communication between the cerebral and spinal circuits that coordinate
  bladder and urethra activities, suprasacral spinal cord lesions, and emergence of
  a capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber-mediated spinal micturition reflex caused by a reorganization
  of synaptic connections in the spinal cord. Peripheral neuropathy can also lead
  to DO. Dementia affecting the prefrontal cortex might also lead to altered central
  micturition circuit. Other nervous system diseases such as cerebral palsy, pituitary
  adenoma compressing the hypothalamus, skull base chordoma, traumatic brain injury,
  and cerebrovascular accident may. Both frontal cortex and hypothalamus are involved.
