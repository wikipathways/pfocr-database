caption: Schematic illustration of the hypothesized chloroplast pH homeostasis via
  H+ transport pathway involving chloroplast membrane-localized transporters, exchangers,
  and protein complexes under high light conditions (top), low and moderate light
  conditions (middle), and upon light-to-dark transitions (bottom). The number of
  proteins shown does not reflect the molecular stoichiometry between them. Black
  arrows indicate ion/H+ flow. Gray dashed arrows indicate the inductive effect of
  a regulator toward its target transporters. Fully active transporters, exchangers,
  and protein complexes are 100% opaque, whereas their less active or inactive counterparts
  are shown with ~50% opacity. The Cytb6f complex and chloroplast ATP synthase are
  activated by light-induced electron transfer chains and the pmf, respectively, under
  light conditions (top, middle) and are deactivated upon light-to-dark transitions
  (bottom). KEA3 performs little function under high light conditions (top) but more
  function under low and moderate light conditions (middle), as discussed by . We
  proposed that KEA3 also acts to neutralize chloroplast pH upon the light-to-dark
  transition (bottom). FLAP1 potentially regulates an unknown H+ transporter and/or
  exhibits functional interaction with DLDG1 and Ycf10, as suggested previously (;
  ). FLAP1 relaxes NPQ induction and shows higher activity under low and moderate
  light conditions (middle) than under high light conditions (bottom), as discussed
  previously (; ). We proposed that FLAP1 also contributes to the neutralization of
  chloroplast pH upon light-to-dark transitions (bottom). BICAT1 uptakes Ca2+ under
  light conditions (). The bicat1 mutants showed lower NPQ induction (; ), although
  BICAT1 is proposed to transport H+ from the thylakoid lumen to the chloroplast stroma.
  This can be explained by the loss of OEC in the bicat1 mutants, because of the reduction
  in the Mn2+ content of chloroplasts, which suppresses either light-induced electron
  transfer chains or H+ translocation across thylakoid membranes (). Next, BICAT1
  functions under light conditions (top, middle), as shown by . As Ca2+ accumulation
  in the chloroplast stroma contributes to the downregulation of CO2 fixation, because
  of the inhibition of several enzymes involved in the CBB cycle (), and to the transcription
  of plastidial genes via the synthesis of the secondary messenger, guanosine tetraphosphate
  (), BICAT1 is proposed to be deactivated upon the light-to-dark transition (bottom).
  Both KEA1 and KEA2 antiporters are less active under light conditions (top, middle)
  than upon light-to-dark transitions (bottom), as reported previously (). The BICAT2
  antiporter is active under light conditions (top, middle), as reported by . As mentioned
  above, Ca2+ uptake by the chloroplast stroma is essential for the suppression of
  CO2 fixation under stress conditions and upon light-to-dark transitions. Thus, we
  proposed that BICAT2 is activated upon light-to-dark transitions (bottom). DLDG1,
  Ycf10, NHD1, and H+-ATPase are all proposed to contribute to H+ extrusion into the
  cytosol, thus contributing to the maintenance of alkaline pH in the chloroplast
  stroma under light conditions (top, middle). The functions of proteins are deactivated
  upon light-to-dark transitions (bottom). Direct H+ export from the thylakoid lumen
  to the cytosol is proposed to occur upon light-to-dark transitions (bottom) to neutralize
  the luminal pH. This mechanism might occur at contact sites between thylakoid and
  envelope membranes (data not shown) or through vesicle transport from thylakoids
  to chloroplast envelope membranes (bottom).
