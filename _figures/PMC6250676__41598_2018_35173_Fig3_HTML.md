caption: Analysis of heme biosynthesis pathway using genome and transcriptome data.
  This pathway consists of genes that mapped to that of Arabidopsis thaliana col heme
  biosynthesis I embedded within Plant Metabolic Network database. At the genome level,
  all ten genes were present whereas only eight genes (labeled with red box) were
  detected at transcript level for Rafflesia cantleyi. Using our assembled Arabidopsis
  transcriptome, all ten genes required in this process were retrieved.

  Rafflesia cantleyi against photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic representatives
  reveals orthologous systems with potentially divergent functions.
