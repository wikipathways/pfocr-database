caption: 'Bile acid metabolism and enterohepatic circulation. The human liver produces
  0.5 g of bile per day via de novo synthesis. Only 5% of the secreted daily amount
  of bile acids is lost as waste each day. Bile acid synthesis can occur via the classical
  (neutral) pathway or the alternative (acidic) pathway. The classical pathway is
  regulated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the first enzyme and rate-limiting
  step in the pathway, which converts cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol. CYP7A1
  is located in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The alternative pathway’s
  first enzyme is sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), present in macrophages and other
  cells, which converts cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol and is the rate-limiting
  step of the alternative pathway. The classical pathway accounts for 90% of synthesized
  bile acids through a multi-enzymatic step. In the classical pathway, 7α-hydroxycholesterol
  is converted to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) by 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase
  (HSD3B7). The classical pathway then converts C4 to cholic acid (CA) or chenodeoxycholic
  acid (CDCA) by a multi-enzymatic step that includes microsomal sterol 12α-hydroxylase
  (CYP8B1), aldo-keto reductase 1D1 (AKR1D1), 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3αHSD),
  and CYP27A1. The alternative pathway mainly produces CDCA in a multi-step enzymatic
  process that includes CYP27A1, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1), AKR1D1, and 3αHSD,
  among others. CA and CDCA are conjugated with glycine or taurine by bile acid–CoA
  synthase (BACS) and bile acid–CoA: amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAAT) to produce
  the conjugated bile acids glycocholic acid (GCA), taurocholic acid (TCA), glycochenodeoxycholic
  acid, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA). Mice also convert CDCA and ursodeoxycholic
  acid (UDCA) to α-muricholic acid (α-MCA) and β-muricholic acid (β-MCA) by cytochrome
  p450 2C70 (CYP2C70), which can then be conjugated with glycine and taurine. In the
  intestines, bile acids are deconjugated by bacterial bile salt hydrolases (BSHs).
  CA and CDCA undergo 7α-dehydroxylation to form (deoxycholic acid) DCA and lithocholic
  acid (LCA), respectively. 7β-dehydroxylation converts UDCA to LCA. The murine-specific
  bile acids created are murideoxycholic acid (MDCA), ω-muricholic acid (ω-MCA), hyocholic
  acid (HCA), and hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA). Bile acids are further modified by dehydrogenation,
  dehydroxylation, oxidation, and epimerization; more recently, gut microbiota have
  been shown to conjugate amino acids to bile acids, termed microbially conjugated
  bile acids [].'
