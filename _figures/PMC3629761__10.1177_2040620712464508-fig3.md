caption: B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway and potential targets. (A) Signaling
  through BCR leads to downstream activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
  transcription factor, which is a driver pathway in activated B-cell like subtype
  (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Signaling also activates the Akt/mTOR
  and MAP kinase pathways. (B) Targeted therapies in ABC DLBCL to inhibit NF-κB are
  dependent on the presence or absence of activating mutations in CARD11. Tumors with
  activating mutations are likely to require inhibition of downstream targets (e.g.
  NF-κB activation) whereas those with wild type are likely to be sensitive to both
  downstream and upstream (e.g. inhibition of BTK or SYK) targets. (Image courtesy
