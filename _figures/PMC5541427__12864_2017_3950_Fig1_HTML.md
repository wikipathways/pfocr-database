caption: A snapshot of PiiL in group-wise view mode, showing the “cell cycle” pathway.
  Samples are grouped by IDH mutation status, each group represented by a box for
  each gene. The average of beta values of each group defines the color ranging from
  dark blue (unmethylated) through white (half-half) to dark red (methylated). The
  number of samples in each group is shown in parenthesis on top of the pathway panel.
  The panel on the left allows for navigating through the samples. The genes in light
  green did not get any match from the loaded data and the ones in gray do not have
  any CpG site based on the applied filter
