caption: 'Schematic representation depicting IFN‐I production and signaling pathways.
  Pathways are depicted using black arrows between involved cofactors, adaptors, signal
  proteins and enzymes. Two pathways are involved in IFN‐I production: A) TLR‐TRAF3,
  and B) RIG‐1/MDA5‐MAVS, which are blocked by structural and nonstructural SARS‐1
  proteins (blue lines and red x marks). C) A signaling pathway for IFN‐I production:
  IFNARs‐STAT1/2, which is blocked by nonstructural proteins ORF‐3a, ORF‐6, and NSP‐1.
  Simultaneously, inflammatory cytokine production pathways are stimulated through
  the TLR‐MAPK pathway (blue arrows) driving the translocation of NF‐κB or AP‐1 via
  S‐protein, N‐protein, and ORF‐3b.'
