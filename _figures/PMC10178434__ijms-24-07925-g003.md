caption: Ways of NAD+/SIRTs/PARPs interactions in the conditions of the cancer process
  development. A cancer cell exhibits genomic instability and inflammation, resulting
  in DNA damage accumulation and Warburg effect formation. The shift in the NAD+/NADH
  balance during the development of the Warburg effect impacts the functioning of
  other essential cellular structures. Sirtuins respond to elevated NAD+ levels by
  altering their activity, influencing PARP function. However, conflicting literature
  reports indicate that sirtuin overexpression and downregulation both occur in cancer
  cells, leaving uncertainty about their role in tumor growth. Additionally, PARPs
  are activated by DNA damage, leading to a decrease in NAD+ levels and potentially
  inducing energy stress and cell death, which is detrimental to cancer cells. Interestingly,
  SIRT1 can translocate between the nucleus and cytoplasm, with cytoplasmic localization
  in tumor cells increasing cell sensitivity to apoptosis [7,238,239]. This suggests
  that SIRT6 and SIRT7 may play a greater role in the early stages of cancer development
  when interacting with PARPs, and SIRT1 may move to the nucleus depending on the
  signaling pathways predominant in each tumor type. Consequently, reprogrammed signaling
  pathways aim to prevent the activation of apoptosis or necrosis by active PARP function.
