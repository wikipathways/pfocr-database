caption: Therapeutic targeting of glycolysis, lipid and redox metabolism in CSCs.
  Metabolic pathways such those involving glucose, lipids and redox balance are potentially
  targetable in CSCs. (1) Glycolysis. 2-DG represent the most promising therapeutic
  approach to neutralize highly glycolytic CSCs in combination treatments. (2) Lipid
  metabolism. 2M14NQ, SSO and the monoclonal antibodies FA6.152 and JC63.1 can block
  CD36 activity; substances like Etomoxir, Avocatin B or ST136 block fatty acid oxidation
  (FAO) in the mitochondria; FASN can be inhibited by drugs such as Cerulenin, C75,
  C93, EGCG, G28UCM, Orlistat, GSK2194069 or GSK837149A; while HMG-CoAR enzyme may
  be inhibited by either Statins or the combination of Brutieridin plus Melitidin;
  GTPase prenylation pathway in which mevalonate is involved can be targeted by both
  Zoledronic acid and GGTL-298; and different steps of the lipid-mediated cell signaling
  may be blocked with molecules such as S32826, PF8380, Celecoxib, ONOAE-208, Misoprostol,
  PGE1 and ω-3 PUFAs; finally, targeting of the main enzyme of lipid desaturation
  route, SCD-1, can be achieved by CAY10556, SC-26196, SSI-4, A939572 or MF-438. (3)
  Redox metabolism. Antioxidant features of CSCs may be inhibited at different levels
  including SOD and GPX proteins with Disulfiram and/or ATO, respectively; ROS-induced
  NRF2 activity can be neutralized by Disulfiram, ATRA, Brusatol, Apigenin and Trigonelline;
  finally, glutathione synthesis may be inhibited either directly or indirectly by
  blocking GS or GLS enzymes with BSO or a glutamine analog, and a mixture of Zaprinast
  with BPTES or 968 compounds, respectively. 2-DG – 2-deoxy-D-glucose, Pyr – pyruvate,
  LDs – lipid droplets, LPR – lipoprotein receptor, FAs – fatty acids, FASN – fatty
  acid synthetase, HMG-CoAR – 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, SCD-1
  – stearoyl-CoA desaturase, MUFAs – monounsaturated fatty acids, PUFAs – polyunsaturated
  fatty acids, FAO – fatty acid oxidation, TCA – tricarbolxylic acid cycle, CPT1 –
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, GTPase – guanosin triphosphatase, I/Q/II/III/IV/V
  – complexes of the electron transport chain, O2- – superoxide anion, H2O2 – oxygen
  peroxide, SOD – superoxide dismutase, GPX – glutathione peroxidase, ROS – reactive
  oxygen species, NRF2 – nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2, GSH – glutathione,
  Glu – glutamate, Gln – glutamine, GS – glutathione synthase, GLS – glutaminase,
  2M14NQ – 2-methylthio-1,4-naphtoquinone, SSO – sulfosuccinimidyl oleate, mAb – monoclonal
  antibody, EGCG – epigallocatechin gallate, ATRA – all-trans retinoic acid, BSO –
  L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine, ATO – arsenic trioxide.
