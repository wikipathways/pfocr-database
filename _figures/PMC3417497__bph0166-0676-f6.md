caption: Schematic presentation of the signalling pathway involved in isoprenaline-induced
  up-regulation of IL-6 production in NMCFs. Binding of isoprenaline to β2-adrenoceptors
  (β2AR) activates adenylate cyclase (AC), then AC converts ATP to cAMP. Increased
  cAMP binds and activates Epac1, and Epac1 stimulates PKCδ phosphorylation and translocation
  through indirect mechanisms. PKCδ phosphorylates the key player, p38 MAPK, which
  activates transcription factors to stimulate IL-6 transcription and production.
  Kinase inhibitors and molecular biological methods of interfering with signalling
  molecules are also shown in the Figure.
