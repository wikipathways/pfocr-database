caption: Cartoon of glucose metabolism in astrocytes (A, left) and neurons (N, right),
  with extracellular space shown as E. Glucose is accumulated both in neurons and
  astrocytes and metabolized via glucose-6-phosphate to pyruvate and in astrocytes
  also used for glycogen synthesis. Pyruvate is mainly metabolized via pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) that, in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, condenses with oxaloacetate (OAA) to form citrate (pathway shown
  in black). Lactate can also be formed from pyruvate. Some of this lactate may be
  released from the cell, although glycogen-derived lactate may be formed and released
  slowly in vivo. According to some of the authors discussed in the present “perspective”
  release of glycogen-derived lactate may be followed by its uptake into neurons and
  use as an important metabolic substrate for neurons during learning. The postulated
  net flux from astrocytes to neurons has never been proven and a brown question mark
  is shown in the Figure. Citrate is further metabolized via α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)
  to eventually regenerate oxaloacetate, which condenses with another molecule of
  acetyl CoA, and so on. During the process two molecules of CO2 are released. The
  purpose of this cycle is solely generation of ATP. In astrocytes additional pathways
  are also operating (red), which is a major reason for the importance of astrocytes,
  including astrocytic glycogenolysis. Glucose is used for synthesis of glycogen,
  which is metabolized to glucose-6-phosphate (by a different route than glucose and
  therefore selectively inhibitable by DAB), and from there by the same pathway as
  glucose, to pyruvate. Pyruvate can be carboxylated to form a “new” molecule of oxaloacetate,
  which condenses with acetyl CoA to form a “new” molecule of citrate, from which
  α-ketoglutarate and glutamate can be formed and transferred to neurons via glutamine
  release (red). Glutamate released as a transmitter to the extracellular space is
  virtually quantitatively taken up by astrocytes. Eighty-five percent of the accumulated
  amount is converted to glutamine by the astrocyte-specific glutamine synthetase
  and carried back to neurons in the “glutamine–glutamate (Gln–Glu) cycle” where it
  can be re-utilized as transmitter glutamate or converted to γ-aminobutyric acid
  (GABA). The remaining 15% is degraded in astrocytes after conversion by cytosolic
  malic enzyme (cME) to α-ketoglutarate, then to malate, which exits the cycle and
  is decarboxylated to pyruvate. This pyruvate can then be oxidized in the TCA cycle
  via acetyl CoA, and astrocytic formation of glutamate combined with subsequent glutamate
  degradation supplies almost as much energy (ATP) as degradation via PDH. Noradrenergic
  agonists subtype-specifically stimulate glycogen synthesis (via α2-adrenergic receptors)
  and glycogenolysis (via β-adrenergic receptors), as well as pyruvate carboxylase
  activity (via α2-adrenergic receptors). Elevated extracellular concentrations of
  K+ also stimulate both glycogenolysis and pyruvate carboxylation. Lactate can function
  as a pyruvate precursor or product in both astrocytes and neurons, whereas acetate
  is an astrocyte-specific precursor of acetyl CoA, but not a precursor for pyruvate
  carboxylation. However, if both acetate and aspartate (Asp) are supplied (indicated
  in blue), oxaloacetate, formed from aspartate, and acetyl CoA, formed from acetate,
  can sustain net production of citrate, α-ketoglutarate and glutamate. Entry of pyruvate
  or acetate into the mitochondrial TCA cycle requires a transporter, here simply
  indicated as MCT.
