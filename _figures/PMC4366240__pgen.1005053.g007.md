caption: Gene products of Rcade-derived p53-targets are colored. Red and blue represent
  genes positively and negatively regulated by p53, respectively. Oncogenic signals
  activate fatty acid (FA) biogenesis in part through the activation of SREBF1. Typically
  oncogenic signals also stimulate the p53 pathway. In addition to SCD, we found several
  Rcade genes (at least in one condition) involved in this process, suggesting that
  p53 regulates de novo FA synthesis at multiple levels. FA-CoA, fatty acyl-CoA; MUFAs,
  monounsaturated fatty acids.
