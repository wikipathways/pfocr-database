caption: 'A: The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways are both activated
  by upstream receptor ligation and frequently co-regulate many downstream targets
  in parallel. Thus for effective elimination of many cancers or prevention of aging,
  it may be necessary to target both signaling pathways. Activation of these pathways
  could also result in increased transcription of many genes that promote cellular
  growth and malignant transformation. B. Inhibition of mTOR can result in the induction
  of autophagy, which is a very important mechanism of cell death, especially in solid
  tumors. C. As described previously, both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathways regulate the activity of apoptotic proteins by post-translational mechanisms.
  Targeting this pathway may also contribute to the induction of apoptosis. Signaling
  molecules promoting phosphorylation events are indicated in green. Stimulatory signaling
  events are indicted in green lines with a green arrow before the target of the phophorylation.
  Small molecule inhibitors are indicated in red. Inhibitory phosphorylation events
  are indicated in red lines with a block on the end before the target of the inhibition.
  Inhibitory signaling or proapoptotic molecules or inactivated molecules are indicated
  in yellow. A growth factor and a growth factor receptor are indicated in purple.
  Active transcription factors are indicated in purple diamonds. Inactivated transcription
  factors are indicated in yellow diamonds.'
