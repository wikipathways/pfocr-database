caption: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction and ISR: The activation of the integrated stress
  response (ISR) during mitochondrial dysfunction is triggered by various mechanisms.
  The fragmentation of mitochondrial DNA is among the leading causes of mitochondrial
  dysfunction, which is managed by an ISR sensor, protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR).
  Mitochondrial dysfunction during amino acid metabolism is managed by another class
  of ISR kinase- general control nonderepressible-2 (GCN2). The Tri-Carboxylic Acid
  (TCA) cycle is fed via the amino acid degradation during metabolic rewiring stage
  of mitochondrial stress, and the depletion of amino acids results in activation
  of GCN2. During this process, the equilibrium maintenance of reducing equivalents
  is maintained by the malate and aspartate shuttle. Upon induction of mitochondrial
  stress by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), a mitochondrial protease
  known as OMA1 regulates the mitochondrial stress dynamics by cleaving DAP3-binding
  cell death enhancer 1 (DELE1). This subsequently activates heme-regulated inhibitor
  (HRI) after translocating to the cytoplasm. The crosstalk between mitochondria and
  endoplasmic reticulum aids ER to sense the alterations in the levels of calcium
  (Ca2 +), ROS, and changes in energy productions; leading to activation of ER transmembrane
  protein- PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction and the ER-mitochondrial
  crosstalk, these protein kinases phosphorylate eIF2α and inhibit global protein
  translation to mitigate stress and restore the normal homeostasis. Until the stress
  is resolved, a translational shift due to upstream open reading frame (uORF) mediates
  selective translation of proteins such as ATF-4 and usurps the global translation
  to mitigate the stress. ATF-4 along with its other dimerization partners regulates
  amino acid synthesis genes, antioxidant pathways, chaperones and metabolism related
  genes to restore the homeostasis post stress. However, chronic stress results in
  activation of CHOP-mediated apoptotic cell death. Figure was created in BioRender'
