caption: 'Pathological macrophages that promote inflammation or fibrosis have altered
  metabolism as a results of lung injury. The metabolic shift, through hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP), causes changes to the glycosylation of proteins implicated
  in inflammation (p65, c-Rel, STAT3, TNFR1, TLR2, TLR7, CD14, CD147, GLUT1) or fibrosis
  (CD206, CD301, integrins β1-β2). Inflammation can perpetuate injury to the lung
  and promote fibrotic changes. These alterations drive the progression of interstitial
  lung diseases (ILDs), including pulmonary fibrosis and sarcoidosis. While metabolism
  can be regulated by key glycoproteins such as GLUT1 and integrins (bolded), known
  therapeutic targets in ILDs, we propose a novel approach: targeting the glycans
  regulating proteins such as CHIT1, NEU1, and FUTs to address metabolic-driven glycosylation
  in ILDs'
