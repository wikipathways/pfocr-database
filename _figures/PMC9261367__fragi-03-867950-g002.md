caption: Signaling pathways in pathogenic T cells. Several signaling pathways have
  been implicated in mediating pathogenic T cell function in autoimmune tissue inflammation.
  In the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which affects individuals with
  a prematurely aged immune system, mitochondrial-ER communication is faulty due to
  insufficient generation of the amino acid aspartate, resulting in expansion of ER
  membranes and excessive production of the cytokine TNF-alpha. Also, in RA T cells,
  mitochondrial repair is impaired due to lacking activation of AMPK and unopposed
  activation of mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface. Mistrafficking of AMPK to the lysosome
  is a consequence of insufficiency in the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase 1(NMT1),
  which is responsible for posttranslational modification of AMPK. In giant cell arteritis,
  a strictly aging-associated autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease, persistent
  signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway and the CD28 pathway have been mechanistically
  connected to pathogenic immune responses in the inflamed tissues.
