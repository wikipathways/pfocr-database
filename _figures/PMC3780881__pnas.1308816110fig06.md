caption: A schematic model for differential regulation of two hunger-driven appetitive
  motivations. The OA-mediated circuit, regulated by the Pvf2/Pvr signaling pathway,
  selectively controls appetite for readily accessible liquid sugar media. This circuit
  functions independently of the previously identified the dILPs/insulin receptor-regulated
  NPF circuit that selectively promotes appetite for solid sugar media.
