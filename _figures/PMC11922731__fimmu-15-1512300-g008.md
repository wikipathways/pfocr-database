caption: This graphic illustrating the role of the CXCL2/CXCR2/Jun signaling pathway
  in microglia-neuron crosstalk in SAE. Sepsis promoted the activation of microglia,
  which expresses and secreted a large amount of CXCL2. CXCL2 induced neuronal ferroptosis
  by activating the CXCR2/Jun signaling axis of hippocampus neurons, thus aggravates
  cognitive impairment in SAE
