caption: Scheme of processes that maintain a certain receptor density on the postsynaptic
  membrane at the activated synapse. The right hand side shows signaling pathways
  for the regulation of FMRP-dependent translation through PP2A phosphatase and S6
  kinase. On the left is the recycling of receptors through endocytosis (marked in
  light brown). The delay parameters τа and τb describe the time of activation (green
  arrow) and inhibition (dark red arrow) of de novo protein synthesis, τe is the time
  of protein translation and inclusion into the receptor complex (violet arrow), and
  τr is the time the receptor protein is localized in the endosome. The krz constant
  describes the efficiency of receptor recycling, the krx and kdx constants are the
  rates of receptor inclusion into the endosome and its degradation, respectively;
  kdz constant is the rate of receptor proteins degradation in the endosome. mGluR
  (metabotropic glutamate receptor); FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein) –
  dendritic mRNA-binding protein; NRXNs (neurexins) – presynaptic membrane proteins;
  NLGNs (neuroligins), SHANK3 (SH3 domain and ankyrin repeat-containing protein),
  PCD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95), HOMER – postsynaptic membrane proteins;
  PIKE (phosphoinositide-3 kinase enhancer), PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase),
  Akt (protein kinase B), TSC1 (tumor suppressor hamartin), TSC2 (tumor suppressor
  tuberin), Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain), S6 kinase – mTOR (mammalian target
  of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Red color marks the names of proteins whose gene
  mutations are associated with neurodegenerative diseases
