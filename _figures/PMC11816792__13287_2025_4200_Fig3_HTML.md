caption: LncRNAs involved in diabetic foot ulcer healing. Adequate blood supply to
  the damaged tissue in diabetic foot ulcers is one of the most essential wound-healing
  processes, which is promoted by lncRNA H19, LINC01435, MALAT1, and linc00511. LncRNA
  H19 supports angiogenesis through histone methylation mediated by the Enhancer of
  Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and modulation of the HIF-1α signaling pathway. MALAT1 enhances
  VEGF expression, Linc00511 reduces PAQR3 and increases Twist1, and the reduction
  of LINC01435 leads to decreased nuclear translocation of YY1, causing knockdown
  of HDAC8, thereby supporting angiogenesis. To regenerate the damaged tissue and
  return to its normal morphology, some cells involved in wound healing need to migrate.
  lncRNAs H19, MALAT1, and CASC2 promote the migration of these cells. H19 does this
  by inhibiting miR-152-3p and increasing PTEN expression. MALAT1 supports migration
  through the inhibition of miR-374a-5p, and CASC2 by inhibiting miRNA 155, both enhancing
  HIF-1α expression and supporting cell migration and proliferation. The regeneration
  of ECM and extracellular space is another primary step in the wound healing, which
  can be related to lncRNAs URIDS, MALAT1, and H19. Reducing URIDS promotes collagen
  production by increasing Plod1 protein stability. MALAT1 accelerates the expression
  of MFGE8 through inhibition of miR-1914-3p. By recruiting SRF to the CTGF promoter
  region, H19 increases its expression and accelerates cell proliferation, ECM regeneration,
  and diabetic foot ulcer healing. To properly heal wounds, inflammation must be regulated
  alongside other wound healing-promoting factors. LncHAR1B supports diabetic foot
  ulcer healing by increasing BHLHE23, which regulates KLF4, a gene that inhibits
  inflammation
