caption: Schematic representation of MAPK modules and scaffolding proteins of the
  yeast mating (A) and the high-osmolarity signaling (B) pathways. (C) A Ste5/Pbs2
  chimera is capable of responding to a signal for one pathway (α factor) with a response
  appropriate to the other (high osmolarity). Defective binding sites for interacting
  proteins are indicated by crossed bars.
