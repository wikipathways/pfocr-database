caption: Three distinct mechanisms contribute to the EGFR-mediated radioresistance
  in cancer cells (a) In response to irradiation, EGFR activity is induced in a ligand-independent
  manner which in turn leads to activation of downstream signaling which is primarily
  involved in the DNA repair mechanism. The putative nuclear localization sequence
  (NLS) present in the EGFR can be recognized by karyopherin further leading to nuclear
  import. In the nucleus, EGFR physically interacts with the catalytic subunit of
  DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKCs) to regulate the non-homologous end joining
  DNA repair pathway. (b) As a consequence of IR, EGFR autophosphorylates and activates
  its corresponding downstream signaling cascades, such as PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/ERK
  pathways to regulate survival signaling (indirectly inhibiting apoptosis) and directly
  promoting proliferation of irradiated cells. (c) The phosphorylated tyrosine residues
  in EGFR can also function as an adaptor molecule for the JAK/STAT pathway.
