caption: Genome damage affects embryo programming. Both environmental and endogenous
  factors can cause DNA breaks. Double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are mainly repaired
  by the homologous recombination pathway in early developing embryos, have more severe
  consequences on embryo development and viability. If not repaired, DSBs may result
  in cell cycle arrest, cell apoptosis and embryo death. This figure was assembled
  using Biorender.
