caption: Activation of the STAT signaling pathway. STAT activation is induced by the
  binding of ligands, such as growth factors and cytokines to their cognate receptors
  (R) on the cell surface, which initiates the phosphorylation of the critical tyrosyl
  residue of STATs by growth factor receptor Tyr kinases (RTKs) or by non-receptor
  Tyr kinases (NRTKs), such as Jaks, Src or Abelson (Abl) kinase. NRTKs can also directly
  phosphorylate STATs in the absence of ligand-binding to receptors. Tyr-phosphorylated
  and activated STAT monomers engage in reciprocal pTyr-SH2 domain interactions for
  dimerization, and the resulting dimers translocate to the nucleus to regulate the
  transcription of specific genes by binding to specific STAT-responsive promoter
  sequences.
