caption: HDACs and KATs that are involved in adipose tissue regulation. While negatively
  regulating the thermogenic program in brown adipocytes via H3K27 deacetylation,
  HDAC1 can also regulate the BAT-specific gene expression in brown adipocytes by
  the BAT. By controlling differentiation, oxidative metabolism, browning, and mitochondrial
  activity, HDAC3 can control the functionality of adipocytes. Acetylation of DNA
  fragmentation factor subunit -like effector proteins can be reduced by HDAC6 regulation
  of CIDEC. As a result, the storage of lipid droplets is reduced, and the cAMP-PKA
  signaling pathway is activated, increasing the production of UCP1 and promoting
  thermogenesis in BAT. HDAC9 can inhibit the expression of adipogenic genes in preadipocytes
  by downregulating the expression of C/EBP genes, which in turn downregulates the
  expression of adipogenic genes in preadipocytes. Exon-PPAR interaction can be controlled
  by SIRT1, which also reduces lipid synthesis. SIRT3 can control the expression of
  MCUE, increasing ROS generation, enhancing BAT whitening, encouraging the expression
  of PGC-1 and UCP1, which can trigger mitochondrial respiration and controll adaptive
  thermogenesis. HDAC11 can control the expression of PPAR-2, AdipoQ, and Perilipin,
  which decreases lipid droplets and prevents the development of adipocytes. To control
  the development of brown adipocytes, GCN5 can increase PPAR transcription and enable
  the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to PRDM16. The (CBP)/p300 can activate the
  Foxo1 gene to control gluconeogenesis and enhance SREBP-1c acetylation, which in
  turn can boost the expression of the lipogenic gene
