caption: GLP‐1 and Wnt signalling in the regulation of bone formation (A) In the inactive
  state of the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway, Wnt is inhibited by a decoy receptor sFRP, where
  as its co‐receptor LRP5/6 binds to inhibitory protein sclerostin or Dkk. Activated
  GSK‐3β can result in proteosomal degradation of β‐catenin, which then inhibits osteoblast
  differentiation. Specific gene expression of adipocyte differentiation including
  PPARγ, C/EBPα, and LPL and bone formation negative regulatory genes SOST increased
  but bone formation positive regulatory genes including Runx2/cbfa1, OPG, and OC
  decreased. (B) The Wnt/β‐catenin pathway is activated by the binding of the Wnt
  to a co‐receptor complex LRP5/6 and frizzled family member. Disruption of the GSK‐3β
  inhibitory complex stabilizes the β‐catenin, which is then translocated into the
  nucleus and activates transcription. GLP‐1 could also stabilize β‐catenin by binding
  to its receptor and increasing the level of intracellular cAMP. The changes in the
  expression of related genes are the opposite of Figure A. sFRP secreted frizzled
