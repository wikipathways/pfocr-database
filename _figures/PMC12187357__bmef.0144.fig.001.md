caption: Microenvironment drivers of the EMT. The development of therapy resistance
  is significantly impacted by EMT drivers related to the tumor microenvironment,
  including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs),
  changes in the microRNAs, hypoxic conditions, extracellular matrix (ECM), and inflammatory
  and immune cells. These factors trigger various signaling pathways, including TGF-β,
  TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-1β, IL-6, HIFs, NOTCH, and WNT, which induce EMT-related transcription
