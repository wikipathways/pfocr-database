caption: 'The current understanding of the alkannin/shikonin (A/S) biosynthetic pathway,
  together with the effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) on gene
  expression. For differential expression, raw reads were mapped to Lithospermum erythrorhizon
  genome, a sister species to L. officinale with very recent divergence histories
  (divergence time approx. 0.5 million years). Uncharacterized steps in the pathway
  are shown with question marks and dashed arrows. Single and double dashed arrows
  depict one and multiple steps that are unknown, respectively. Coloured letters indicate
  characterised steps. The mean log2 fold-change in expression level of MeJA (red)
  and SA (white) treated roots as compared to control in mevalonate (MVA), phenylpropanoid
  (PHP), and A/S pathway are shown. *Denotes differentially expressed genes at log2fold >|1|
