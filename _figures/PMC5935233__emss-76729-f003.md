caption: Oncogene-induced genomic instability. A, germline mutations in DNA repair
  genes lead to GIN. Activated oncogenes elicit genomic instability by causing defects
  in DNA repair, telomere erosion or replication stress; see text for details. B,
  activated oncogenes induce a multifaceted set of intertwined activities that deregulate
  fork progression leading to under-replicated DNA and genomic instability. In particular,
  through deregulation of the Rb/E2F pathway licensing factors are increased which
  instigates origin re-firing that decreases fork speed in response to head-to-tail
  fork collisions. Deregulation of CDK activity can decrease or increase origin firing.
  In the first case, fork speed is initially increased, but the cell ends up with
  under-replicated DNA due to its inability to rescue endogenous RS by firing dormant
  origins. Increased origin firing raises the possibility of TRCs and simultaneously
  may cause depletion of dNTPs, histones or RPA. Oncogene-induced ROS either increase
  origin firing or oxidize nucleotides that potentially may affect fork progression.
  Oncogenes also increase transcription activity that either directly or through R-loops
  enhance TRCs.
