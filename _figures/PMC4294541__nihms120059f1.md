caption: Proposed model of ADI-induced cell death. Arginine is synthesized in a two-step
  process catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS)
  and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Arginine deiminase (ADI) hydrolyzes arginine
  back into its citrulline precursor (solid arrow). In prostate tumors that lack ASS,
  citrulline cannot re-enter the arginine synthesis pathway (dashed arrow), resulting
  in the depletion of intracellular arginine and the accumulation of citrulline upon
  ADI treatment. ADI treatment leads to a rapid induction of autophagy (4 hours) as
  a protective response to delay apoptosis at 4 days. Prolonged autophagy, however,
  may also contribute to caspase-independent cell death (dotted arrow). Cell death
  can be enhanced using chloroquine (CQ), an autophagic inhibitor, or docetaxel (DT),
  a caspase-dependent apoptotic inducer.
