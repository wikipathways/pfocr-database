caption: 'Model for quantitative regulation by the TCF/β-catenin asymmetry pathway.
  A) SYS-1β-catenin levels are higher in posterior cells where it complexes with low
  levels of POP-1/TCF to activate TFs that can partner with POP-1/SYS-1 in later cells
  to regulate new targets. Quantitative differences in POP-1 and SYS-1 levels due
  to memory of signaling states from previous mitoses further influences target selection.
  B) Proposed model explaining the three categories of TCF targets: targets that require
  TCF for repression and activation have intermediate activity provided by additional
  “context TFs,” targets that require TCF only for activation have low levels of context
  TF activity, and targets that require TCF only for repression have high levels of
  context TF activity.'
