caption: The active roles of transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) during infection may signal
  the host’s metabolic fitness to pathogens. Holo-transferrin (Tf ) binding to TfR1
  reflects systemic iron sufficiency, such that the ligand–receptor complex itself
  might be the entry target and not simply TfR1 alone. Alternatively, other ligands
  (e.g., ferritin, polymeric A1 isotype immunoglobulin, unknown moieties) could participate
  in viral invasion as coreceptors. TfR1 also has iron-independent functions, including
  the activation of signaling pathways that might be involved with infections to suppress
  the cellular stress response. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator
  of energy metabolism, appears to positively regulate TfR1 by maintaining the endocytic
  recycling pathway to guard against receptor degradation and to suppress tristetraprolin
  (TTP) degradation of TfR1 messenger RNA. Thus, cell surface TfR1 reports cellular
  energy status to the virus, reflecting mTOR control.
