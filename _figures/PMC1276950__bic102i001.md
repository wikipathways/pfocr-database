caption: 'The accepted pathway for the synthesis of sLex structures on O-linked glycans
  starts with a common core1 precursor and follows three different directions []:
  the formation of core2-branched sLex is initiated by C2GnT-I (underlined) followed
  by β4GalT-IV, ST3GalT-IV and FucT-VII (underlined). The core 1 precursor can also
  be modified by β3GlcNAcT-3, forming an extended-core1 oligosaccharide, which is
  further galactosylated by β4GalT (probably the β4GalT-I) and fucosylated by FucT-VII
  resulting in the expression of core1-extended sLex structures. No sLex antigen is
  synthesized (chain termination) if the core1 precursor undergoes sialylation catalysed
  by ST3GalT-I and ST6GalNAcT-I.'
papertitle: 'N-glycans of core2 β(1,6)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (C2GnT-I)
  but not those of α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase-VII (FucT-VII) are required for the synthesis
  of functional P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1): effects on P-, L- and E-selectin
  binding.'
