caption: Sources of sphingolipids for the parasite. The biosynthetic pathways for
  sphingolipids in both the host cell and the parasite. (I) Ceramides added exogenously
  to mammalian cells are internalized and become concentrated in the host Golgi apparatus,
  where ceramides are converted into sphingomyelin (SM) or complex glycosphingolipids
  (glycoSL), which may then be delivered to the plasma membrane. (II) In the host
  de novo synthetic pathway, ceramides are produced in the ER. The inhibitor myriocin
  blocks serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), which catalyzes the first step in the
  pathway (CerS, ceramine synthase; Des, dihydroceramide desaturase). Ceramides are
  then transferred to the Golgi either via vesicles or CERT. Within the Golgi, ceramides
  are converted into sphingomyelin by sphingomyelin synthases (SMS) or complex glycoSL.
  (III) In the sphingomyelinase pathway, neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) in the
  plasma membrane catalyze the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramides. The compound
  GW 4869 is a noncompetitive inhibitor of neutral sphingomyelinases. (IV) In the
  salvage pathway, acid sphingomyelinase located in the endolysosomes (E-L) catalyze
  the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramides. (V) The parasite has its own de
  novo synthesis pathway for ceramides and sphingomyelin, inositol phosphoceramide
  (IPC) by IPC synthase (IPCS), and IPC derivatives, based on metabolic labeling studies.
  Arrows in green are the potential host pathways that are diverted by Toxoplasma.
