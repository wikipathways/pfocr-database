caption: '(a) Rats are capable of synthesizing vitamin C from limited substrates,
  providing an inherent resistance to scurvy. The rat-specific enzyme, Gulo, catalyses
  the last enzymatic step of the vitamin C synthesis pathway: L-gulonolactone oxidase
  (EC 1.1.3.8). The human orthologue of Gulo is a non-functional pseudogene (GULOP).
  (b) Gout formation is associated with accumulation and crystallization of urate,
  the end product of purine catabolism in humans. Rats are resistant to gout, because
  urate can be further degraded into allantoin, which is more soluble than urate.
  (c) Most mammals can synthesize the monosaccharide, Neu5Gc, which is known as a
  nonhuman sialic acid that is incorporated into glycoproteins. (d) The human-specific
  enzyme FUT3 synthesizes the Lewisa antigen (Lea) which is involved in Lewis blood
  group determination and is the precursor for the pancreatic cancer biomarker, CA19-9.
  (e) Metabolic tasks simulating the production of primary and secondary bile acids
  were consistent with bile acid species reported in a previous study that compared
  rat and human liver samples (X''s indicate absence of production). (f) Summary of
  rat-specific and shared primary bile acid synthesis routes from cholesterol. Cyp3a18
  was hypothesized as the critical enzyme enabling rats to produce rat-specific primary
  bile acids, which had not been previously described. (g) In the process of ‘bile
  acid recycling'', primary bile acids secreted by the liver into the gut are transformed
  by bacteria and subsequently reabsorbed by the liver. Synthesis of secondary bile
  acids were accounted for in iRno and iHsa by including extracellular reactions associated
  with gut bacteria. Interplay between rat liver and gut metabolism was necessary
  for iRno to simulate the synthesis and secretion of the rat-specific bile acid,
  murideoxycholic acid (MDCA). CA19-9, carbohydrate antigen 19-9; LacCer, lactosylceramide;
  ManNAc, N-acetylmannosamine; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5Gc, N-glycolylneuraminic
  acid.'
