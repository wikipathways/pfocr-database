caption: 'Ethylene signaling participates in microtubule reassembly under salt stress:
  a working model. Cortical microtubules initially depolymerize and then recover themselves
  under salt stress. PHS1-mediated phosphorylation of α-tubulin promotes microtubule
  depolymerization under salt stress. SPR1 is degraded by the proteasome-mediated
  protein degradation pathway, which facilitates salt-induced rapid depolymerization
  of cortical microtubules. Ethylene signaling plays a positive role in microtubule
  reassembly under salt stress. WDL5, as a downstream effector of ethylene signaling,
  promotes microtubule reassembly and salt tolerance in plants. In addition, PA binding
  to MAP65-1 and relocalization of RIC1 favor microtubule reassembly under salt stress.
  Scale bars = 20 μm.'
