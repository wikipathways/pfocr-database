caption: The dysregulated process of de novo fatty acid synthesis in CRC cells. Enhanced
  glucose metabolism drives the production of acetyl-CoA, which feeds into the TCA
  cycle. Citrate is then exported to the cytoplasm, where CL catalyzes its conversion
  back into acetyl-CoA, a precursor for fatty acid biosynthesis. Key enzymes such
  as ACC and FASN drive this process, providing essential lipid components for cell
  membrane formation and energy storage, thereby supporting cancer cell proliferation
  and progression. The figure was generated by using BioRender.com (“Metabolic pathway
  in mitochondria”). LD, lipid droplets; CL, citrate lyase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase; FATP/CD36, fatty acid transporters
