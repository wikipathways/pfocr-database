caption: 'Schematic representation of mechanical stress-related podocyte injury. Angiotensin
  II receptor 1 (AT1 R) upon stimulation causes increased intracellular calcium influx
  through transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6), followed by increased calcineurin
  activity and increased degradation of synaptopodin, an actin-binding protein. Cytoskeletal
  rearrangements are controlled by Rho GTPases: cell division control protein 42 (CDC42),
  Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1), and Ras homolog family member A (RhoA). Mechanical
  stress is sensed and transmitted by B integrins to erythrocyte membrane protein
  band 4.1 like 5 (EPB41L5). EPB41L5 activates intracellular pathways which regulate
  the translation of proteins that influence RhoA activity and cytoskeletal rearrangement.
  Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcription co-regulator factor stimulated by
  EPBB41L5 activity. YAP nuclear translocation results in the translation of proteins
  that regulate podocyte Rho GTPase activity. Membrane proteins like TRPC5/6 also
  can directly regulate the activity of Rho GTPases, other membrane proteins may be
  also involved in Rho GTPase regulation (dashed arrows). Permeability factors (soluble
  urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, suPAR; hemopexin, HPX; and cardiotrophin-like
  cytokine factor 1, CLCF1) interfere with FA; in particular, suPAR binds and activates
  αvß3 B integrin, further modulating cytoskeleton rearrangements via CDC42 and RAC1.
  APOL1 expression increases the linking of suPAR. This figure was created with BioRender.com'
