caption: Expression patterns of genes related to the phenylpropane biosynthetic pathway
  during A. alternata infection. A The synthesis of lignin. B The synthesis of anthocyanin.
  The log2 fold change was colored using Cluster 3.0 (red for upregulated, green for
  downregulated), each horizontal row represents a DEG with its gene ID, and the vertical
  columns represent 2, 3, and 4 DPI from left to right
