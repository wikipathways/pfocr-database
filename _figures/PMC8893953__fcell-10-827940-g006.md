  Chemical structures of the key members of various fat-soluble and water-soluble
  vitamins. (B) Bioinformatic analysis reveals a potential involvement of vitamin
  B6 in epididymal Ca2+ homeostasis. Presented data were originally published in iScience
  () and reanalyzed. Briefly, proteomic analysis the in-gel digested MGP-positive
  32-kDa band was performed with LC-MS/MS analysis (n = 3 rats). The MGP-positive
  32-kDa band in whole epididymis protein lysates underwent proteomic analysis followed
  by GO and KEGG-based bioinformatic analysis and identified 301 genes present in
  all 3 lysates. 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism is one of the primary enriched gene
  clusters, consistent with MGP carboxylation. Other key enriched clusters include
  phagosome and its downstream pathway of antigen processing and presentation, proximal
  tubule bicarbonate reclamation, and metabolic pathways. The cluster of metabolic
  pathways mainly contains sub-clusters for catabolic pathways, including glycolysis
  and gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle and pyruvate metabolism, in addition to a vitamin-B6
  metabolic pathway, suggesting the involvement of vitamin-B6 in the metabolism of
  Ca2+-MGP aggregates. The end products of most of these pathways are substrates for
  oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid elongation. These enriched pathways are
  in consistent with the notion of that chelation activity of carboxylated Ca2+-bound
  MGP contributes to the scavenging of extracellular metabolites, and Ca2+ serves
  as a cofactor in this process. Circle size indicates enrichment degree of each pathway,
  and border width represents the value of statistical significance of the enriched
  gene clusters [-Log (False Discovery Rate, FDR)].
