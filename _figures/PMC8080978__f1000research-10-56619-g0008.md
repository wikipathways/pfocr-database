caption: There are three possible mechanisms (1) SARS-CoV-2 an enveloped single-strand
  RNA virus, virions are internalized probably by receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR)
  family receptor ERBB4 dependent macropinocytosis like SARS-CoV-1 (the process of
  macropinocytosis indicated in magenta circle). The cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2
  involves binding to ERBB4 expressing AEC2 in the plasma membrane, macropinocytosis,
  and cathepsin based cleavage of the spike glycoproteins. The host transmembrane
  serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) for spike priming and cathepsin cleaves spike glycoprotein
  S1 domain, permits fusion with endosomal membranes and release virions genome into
  the host cytoplasm; (2) Single-strand RNA translated polypeptides cleaved by the
  3cLpro of SARS-CoV-2 possibly attached with mitochondrial ERBB4 and involve viral
  replication through MAPK signaling pathway. Then, the cell to cell spread action,
  the replicated SARS-CoV-2 attached to the uninfected AEC2 receptor and then restart
  macropinocytosis; (3) The part of S2 domain presents peptides into antigen-presenting
  cells (APC) to modulate host immune system through NFkB- signaling.
