caption: a Regulation of NRF2 under basal conditions; b NRF2 induction by activators;
  c KEAP1 hypermethylation; d KEAP1 mutation. Under normal conditions, the levels
  of NRF2 protein are kept low by KEAP1 sequestration and by the CUL3 ubiquitin ligase,
  which targets NRF2 for proteasomal degradation. Under conditions of electrophilic
  and oxidative stress, KEAP1 no longer sequesters NRF2, which accumulates in the
  nucleus where it binds to sMaf, leading to the induction of genes driven by antioxidant-responsive
  elements (ARE). In lung cancer, hypermethylation of KEAP1 promoter and/or KEAP1
  mutation prevents NRF2 from being sequestered so that NRF2 is permanently activated
  (switched on) leading to oncogenesis. Alternatively, hypermethylation of the NFE2L2
  gene promoter can lead to the repression of NRF2 expression.
