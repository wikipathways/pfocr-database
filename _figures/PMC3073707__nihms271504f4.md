caption: 'We propose that exposure of pancreatic β-cells to high glucose, palmitate
  or cytokines leads to activation of Tiam1/Rac1 signaling axis culminating in the
  activation of Nox. This, in turn, results in generation of ROS, which adversely
  affect mitochondrial functions leading to loss in membrane potential thus favoring
  cytochrome C release into the cytosolic compartment. The latter promotes the activation
  of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 and associated cleavage of substrate proteins leading
  to the apoptotic demise of the β-cell. Inhibition of Nox by DPI appears to prevent
  such metabolic defects. Potential involvement of Taim1/Rac1 signaling cascade was
  verified by the use of NSC23766, a selective inhibitor of this pathway. It also
  appears that intracellularly-generated CER via the de novo pathway from palmitate
  mediates activation of Tiam1/Rac1 and Nox activation steps since fumonisin B1, a
  selective inhibitor of the ceramide biosynthesis from palmitate largely restored
  palmitate effects []. Furthermore, C2-CER, a cell permeable analogue of CER, mimicked
  palmitate effects []. It is likely that exposure of isolated β-cells to glucose
  also leads to intracellular accumulation of CER via activation of sphingomyelinases
  endogenous to the β-cell. In addition, glucose can directly activate Tiam1/Rac1
  signaling pathway independent of its effects on intracellular CER levels. Our recently
  published evidence indicates that exposure of isolated β-cells to a mixture of cytokines
  [i.e., IL-1β, TNFα and IFNγ] also leads to increase in the expression of p47phox,
  Tiam1/Rac1 activation and metabolic dysfunction []. Together, these data appear
  to implicate critical regulatory roles of Tiam1/Rac1/Nox signaling steps in the
  metabolic dysfunction of the β-cell under the duress of various noxious stimuli.Abbreviations
  used in this figure are: SMase: sphingomyelinase; Tiam1: T-lymphoma invasion and
  metastasis1; DPI: diphenyleneiodonium chloride.'
