caption: The diagram represents a working model of the spermathecal calcium signaling
  pathway. Green lines indicate interactions that promote cell contraction, and magenta
  lines indicate those which inhibit contraction. Dashed lines indicate possible regulatory
  interactions. We propose FLN-1 acts upstream or in parallel to PLC-1 to initiate
  calcium release via ITR-1. FLN-1 also plays a downstream role in contraction and
  maintenance of the F-actin cytoskeleton.
