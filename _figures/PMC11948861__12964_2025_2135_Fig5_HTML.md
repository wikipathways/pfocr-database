caption: Autophagy-mediated other forms of RCD. A Autophagy-mediated ICD. ICD inducers
  initiate the autophagy-dependent secretion of DAMPs (ATP, HMGB1, and CALR) and the
  release of antigens by cancer cells. DAMPs induce the maturation and activation
  of APCs and the antigens are subsequently engulfed by APCs where they can be processed
  via the autophagic machinery for loading onto MHC-I or MHC-II. Then, MHC-I or MHC-II
  is presented to CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, respectively, after which activated T cells
  induce ICD in cancer cells. B Autophagy-mediated NETosis. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway activates Wdfy3-dependent selective autophagy, which mediates NETosis, but
  the essential protein has not yet been confirmed. C Autophagy-mediated pyroptosis.
  miR-637 and miR-34a-5p are involved in the activation of autophagy, which leads
  to LMP and subsequent CTSB leakage, causing NLRP3 inflammasome activation, GSDMD
  cleavage and ultimately pyroptosis. The abovementioned mechanism is shared in different
  cell or animal models. D Autophagy-mediated entosis. The PI3K complex consists of
  Beclin1, UVRAG, and VPS34, and activates the downstream autophagy conjugation system,
  which mediates the recruitment of LC3 into the single-membrane entotic vacuole.
  Then, the cells are internalized into neighboring host cells via the entotic vacuole
  and fuses with lysosomes, thus causing internalized cell entosis. E Autophagy-mediated
  parthanatos. When treating HT1080 cells with oxidative stress, the autophagy cargo
  receptor p62 translocates into the nucleus and forms disulfide-linked conjugates
  (DLCs). The DLCs further accumulates into p62-based aggresome-like induced structures
  (ALISs), which hyperactivate PARP1, and activated PARP1 directly binds to AIFM1,
  leading to its translocation from the mitochondria to the nucleus. Finally, AIFM1
  induces parthanatos in the nucleus. This figure created in BioRender. Huang, X.
