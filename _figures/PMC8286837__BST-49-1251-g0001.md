caption: The UPR sensors, PERK, IRE1 and ATF4 are held in an inactive state via the
  binding of GRP78, a chaperone protein and the master regulator of the UPR. Hypoxia-induced
  ER stress leads to the dissociation of GRP78 from these sensors as GRP78 detects
  and binds to unfolded proteins. Following activation, PERK phosphorylates eIF2α
  to inhibit protein synthesis and allows for the transcription of ATF4 which leads
  to the transcriptional induction of genes associated with apoptosis, autophagy and
  amino acid metabolism. Activation of IRE1 followed by autophosphorylation activates
  its RNase activity leading to the alternative splicing of XBP1u to form XBP1s, a
  transcription factor that controls the transcription of genes encoding proteins
  involved in protein folding. ATF6 is transported to the Golgi upon activation where
  it is processed by S1P and S2P generating a cytosolic fragment (ATF6f) which up-regulates
  the transcription of genes involved in ERAD. Simultaneously, in the cells in S-phase,
  hypoxia leads to replication stress, manifested by stalled replication forks, decreased
  origin firing and an accumulation of single-stranded DNA. Hypoxia-induced replication
  stress activates the DDR pathway which includes both the ATM and ATR kinases. ATM
  and ATR phosphorylate their target transducers including, but not limited to, Chk1,
  Chk2 and p53. The transducers then up-regulate effectors, including genes that play
  a role in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair. The biological endpoints
  of UPR and DDR signalling are shared and focus on resolving the stress, allowing
  the cell time to repair and recover or, in the case of extreme stress and irreparable
  damage inducing cell death.
