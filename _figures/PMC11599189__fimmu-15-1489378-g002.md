caption: The figure illustrates the various functions and molecular interactions of
  circFOXP1 in cellular processes. (A) Epigenetic regulation, showing how circFOXP1
  influences DNA methylation and histone modification by recruiting DNMT1 and KDM5B.
  (B) The role of circFOXP1 in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. (C) Sequestration of
  RNA-binding proteins, demonstrating how circFOXP1 functions by binding to RNA-binding
  proteins. (D) The involvement of circFOXP1 in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt
  signaling pathways. (E) The miRNA sponge function of circFOXP1. (F) The translation
  of circFOXP1 into the protein circFOXP1-231aa via ribosomes. (by Figdraw2.0)
