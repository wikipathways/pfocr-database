caption: 'Life cycle of Zika virus. Zika virus has a single-stranded positive RNA
  genome, which is about 11kb in length and is complexed with the viral capsid protein
  (C) within the nucleocapsid, whereas the outer membrane of the virion is a lipid
  bilayer containing the viral membrane protein (M), and envelope protein (E), as
  shown on the left. Virions attach to the surface of a host cell by interactions
  between viral surface glycoproteins and cell surface receptors and subsequently
  enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis and are internalized into clathrin-coated
  pits (1). Acidification of the endosomal vesicle triggers conformational changes
  in the virion, fusion of the viral and cell membranes, and particle disassembly
  and the genome is released into the cytoplasm (2). The positive-sense genomic RNA
  is translated into a single polyprotein (3) that is processed cotranslationally
  and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteases (4). This cleavage makes
  a total of 10 proteins: 3 structural proteins (C, prM [glycosylated precursor to
  M], and E) and 7 nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).
  The structural proteins are located at the N-terminus of the polyprotein, and the
  nonstructural proteins are found at the C-terminus (shown inset). Genome replication
  occurs on intracellular membranes known as vesicle packages, which facilitate the
  assembly of the viral replication complex containing viral RNA and cellular and
  viral proteins, for example, NS3 and NS5 (5). Replication initiates with negative-strand
  RNA synthesis, and this then serves as a template for the synthesis of multiple
  copies of the positive-strand genomic RNA (6). Virus assembly occurs on the surface
  of the endoplasmic reticulum (7) by budding, and nascent virus particles travel
  along the host secretory pathway through the trans-Golgi network (8), where virion
  maturation occurs followed by release from the cell by exocytosis (9). [Color figure
