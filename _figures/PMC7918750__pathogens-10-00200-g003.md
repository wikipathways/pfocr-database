caption: A model of Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) factors that contribute to latency
  maintenance. Host cell signaling is modulated by HCMV proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs)
  to evade immune detection, limit proliferation, and suppress myeloid differentiation.
  Furthermore, miR-UL148D inhibits activin signaling to limit pro-inflammatory cytokine
  release from the latently infected cell []. Additionally, miR-US5-2 targets the
  transcriptional repressor NGFI-A-binding protein 1 (NAB1) to increase Transforming
  Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) production and secretion, resulting in myelosuppression.
  However, miR-UL22A blocks the TGFβ pathway to protect the infected cell from the
  effects of TGFβ and to maintain viral genomes during latency []. Moreover, miR-US25-1
  also prevents the loss of viral genomes during latency by targeting the GTPase Ras
  homology family member A (RhoA) and inhibiting proliferation of latently infected
  CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) []. HCMV miRNAs are shown in red.
