caption: Apoptosis signaling pathway and its control by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation
  events that promote apoptosis are highlighted in green while those that inhibit
  apoptosis are highlighted in red. Propagation of the apoptotic signal is denoted
  with an arrow. Inhibitory interactions are denoted with bar-headed lines (for example,
  t-Bid/BIM/PUMA inhibit the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins whereas the anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-2 proteins inhibit Bax/Bak activation). The dotted rectangles represent groups
  of Bcl-2 family members with differential binding partners (i.e., Noxa preferentially
  binds to A1 and Mcl-1, whereas Bad/Bik/Bmf/Hrk bind more strongly to Bcl-2/Bcl-w/Bcl-xL).
  See text for further details on the involved kinases and phosphatases.
