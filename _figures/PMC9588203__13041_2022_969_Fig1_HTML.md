caption: 'TREM-1 signaling pathway. Two isoforms of TREM-1 exist: the membrane-bound
  type (mTREM-1) and the soluble type (sTREM-1). mTREM-1 is located on the plasma
  membrane, and its extracellular immunoglobulin(Ig)-like domain is responsible for
  recognizing ligands such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns and danger-associated
  molecular patterns. After activation, the transmembrane (TM) domain transmits signals
  intracellularly by binding to the adapter molecule DAP12. Upon binding, tyrosine
  phosphorylation in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that is
  mediated by Src-family kinases recruits the zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP70)
  and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), thereby initiating a cascade of downstream signalization,
  including the activation of the phosphoinositide phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ), phosphoinositide
  3-kinases (PI3K), Janus kinase (JAK), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  pathways. These pathways induce Ca2+ mobilization, actin cytoskeleton rearrangement,
  and activation of transcription factors, which are responsible for encoding the
  expression of inflammatory mediators. Metalloproteinases (MMPs) can cleave mTREM-1
  into the soluble form, which competes with mTREM-1 for the same ligands and blocks
  mTREM-1 signaling. Decoy peptides that have been developed for the TREM-1 ligand-binding
  domain include LP17, LR12, and M3, while GF9 is an inhibitor that targets the transmembrane
  structural domains of TREM-1. All of these can block mTREM-1 and inhibit the activity
  of the inflammatory pathway. In addition to the inflammatory pathway, TREM-1 induces
  pyroptosis through the NLRP3/Caspase-1 signaling pathway and participates in oxidative
  stress through ROS release. The above pathways together contribute to neuronal damage'
