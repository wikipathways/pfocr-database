caption: Activation of oxidative stress-related pathways by radiotherapy. In response
  to IR, activated ErbB1 and ErbB2 (via interaction with one of the ligand-bound partners)
  induce the subsequent activation of downstream signaling pathways that include MAPK,
  PI3K/AKT and FoxO. The activation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways increases
  the expression levels of Nrf2, thereby activating several antioxidant systems in
  response to oxidative stress. The FoxO-target genes include various genes encoding
  antioxidant proteins, which have a complex role in the induction of oxidative stress.
  It may not only activate the antioxidant system to promote tumor cell survival,
  but also promote apoptosis. NF-κB is another key pathway regulating the fine balance
  of the cellular redox status. The binding of the NF-κB proteins to DNA regulates
  the transcription of various potential antioxidant targets. In addition, IR activates
  the SLC7A11/GPX4 axis, which is considered to be one of the most important means
  of regulating oxidative stress via the ferroptotic pathway. IR, ionizing radiation;
  ErbB, Erb-b receptor tyrosine kinase; FoxO, forkhead box protein O; SLC7A11, solute
