  left side: Immune cells (macrophages, monocytes, T cells, neutrophils and dendritic
  cells) localized in the lungs release specific cytokines and chemokines along with
  high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) during severe COVID-19 pneumonitis. Alveolus
  right side: Molecular mechanism of action of COVID-19 therapeutics include blocking
  the spike binding receptor (Xevudy), terminating viral RNA synthesis (Remdesvir,
  Niramatrelvir, Ritonavir, Molnupiravir). Corticosteroids (Dexamethasone) block transcription
  of glucocorticoid-responsive genes, many of which are pro-inflammatory e.g. Type
  1 interferons. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors that block the signalling pathway (Baricitinab).
  IL-6 signalling can also be targeted (Tocilizumab).'
