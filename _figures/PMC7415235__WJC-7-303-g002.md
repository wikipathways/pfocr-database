caption: 'Key pathways involved in foam cell formation regulated by microRNA. Native
  low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and oxidized LDL is processed in the late endosome/lysosomes
  by lysosomal acid lipase, generating free cholesterol which is stored in the form
  of lipid droplets after esterification via acyl-CoA cholesteryl acyl transferase
  or sterol O-acyltransferase 1 at the endoplasmic reticulum. Cholesterol can be removed
  from the cell by trafficking from the late endosomes, or by hydrolysis of lipid
  droplets and transport to the plasma membrane to be transferred to lipid-poor apolipoprotein
  A-I or nascent high-density lipoprotein via ABC transporters (ATP binding cassette
  transporter A1, ATP binding cassette transporter G1). Inflammatory signalling pathways
  can be activated in foam cells via recognition of oxLDL by toll-like receptor 4
  (TLR4), or by intracellular free cholesterol forming cholesterol crystals, leading
  to the expression and release of inflammatory cytokines. Since their initial discovery,
  numerous miRNA sequences have been shown to play a role in targeting each of these
  key steps in the formation of foam cells. For example, influx of modified lipoproteins
  into macrophages via oxidized low-density lipoprotein (lectin-like) receptor 1,
  cluster of differentiation 36 and TLR4, is reported to be regulated by miR-21, miR-30,
  miR-98, miR-181a, miR-223 and miR-758. The cholesterol efflux pathway is modulated
  by distinct sequences, including miR-19b, miR-20a/b, miR-23, miR-27a/b, mir-155
  and miR-378, while miR-9 and miR-17 regulate the esterification and hydrolysis of
  cholesterol droplets. MicroRNA-181a regulates both lipid metabolism and inflammatory
  response, while let-7g, miR-146a/b, miR125b and miR-155 influence macrophage inflammatory
