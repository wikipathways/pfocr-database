caption: Roadmap of peptide vaccine versus peptide mimic strategies. Pathway A involves
  the design of chimeric peptides comprising the conformational B-cell epitope and
  incorporating a “promiscuous” T-cell epitope. The vaccine is emulsified with an
  adjuvant (nor-MDP) in a vehicle (ISA 720; squalene/arlacel) (C), and used for vaccination.
  When relevant transgenic mice (MMTV/neu) or a syngeneic model) (D1) are available
  for assessing vaccine efficacy, these mice are immunized sc with the chimeric peptide
  vaccine and tumor growths/reductions are monitored over time. Rabbits are used as
  a surrogate model (D2) to develop high affinity antipeptide antibodies which can
  be used to treat transplantable mouse models (SCID) (E1) after tumor challenge.
  Tumor growth is then monitored over time as we have described. The humoral response
  (D3) results in activated B-lymphocyte (D4) and the plasma cell give rise to high
  affinity antibodies (D5) that recognizes the antigen (D6) on tumor cells causing
  cell death through several different mechanisms (D7) (ADCC, Apoptosis, etc). On
  the other hand, Pathway B involves the design of conformational B cell-peptide mimics
  with enhanced proteolytic stability. Because a T-cell epitope is not included, the
  peptide lacks immunogenicity, thus the peptide mimic treatment does not elicit antibody
  production. The peptide mimics are dissolved in PBS and are injected in mice by
  iv treatment (E2) at the time of tumor challenge, and treated repeatedly over several
  weeks until control mice develop large tumors. This strategy allows us to corroborate
  effectiveness of antibody treatment vs. peptide treatment, permitting us to prioritize
  peptide constructs for testing in (i) transgenic mouse models (F); and (ii) human
  clinical trials (G). The peptide mimics bind the receptor (E3) and inhibits signal
  transduction (E4) resulting in tumot cell death.
