caption: Potential anti-inflammatory effects of increased global SUMOylation in the
  intestine. Reported effects of SUMOylation on major inflammatory pathways and effectors
  are summarized on the left. For detailed reviews on SUMO-dependent regulation of
  the interferon or the NFκB pathway, we refer to excellent recent works (, ). Modulated
  expression of inflammatory mediators was reported in the intestines (, ). The right
  panel highlights cellular targets of SUMOylation and the potential effects of increased
  global SUMOylation in controlling exaggerated inflammation. IFN, interferon; PMN,
  polymorphonuclear leukocytes; MΦ, Macrophage; Treg, regulatory T cell; DC, dendritic
  cell.
