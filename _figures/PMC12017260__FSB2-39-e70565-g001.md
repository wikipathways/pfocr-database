caption: Association between NOX1 and NOX2 and the invasive phenotype of colon cancer.
  (A)Less aggressive human colon cancer cells, such as HT29 and Caco‐2, showed high
  levels of NOX1 expression and low levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP‐7) expression,
  along with elevated phosphorylation of AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK). Upon
  treatment with 12‐O‐tetradecanoylphorbol‐13‐acetate (TPA), these cells exhibited
  an induction of NOX2 expression that surpassed that of NOX1. This increase was accompanied
  by enhanced ROS production and a corresponding rise in MMP‐7 expression, as well
  as a decrease in AMPK phosphorylation. These changes were similar to the conditions
  observed in highly aggressive human colon cancer cells, like SW620 and HCT116. (B)
  In contrast, highly aggressive human colon cancer cells, such as SW620 and HCT116,
  showed higher NOX2 expression than NOX1, along with high MMP‐7 expression and decreased
  AMPK phosphorylation. Treatment with specific NOX2 small interfering RNA (siRNA)
  revealed that NOX1 expression was higher than NOX2, leading to a reduction in ROS
  generation and a corresponding decrease in MMP‐7 expression, while AMPK phosphorylation
  increased. This treatment effectively abolished the highly invasive phenotype induced
  by TPA in HT29 cells, indicating that NOX2‐derived ROS production induces an invasive
  phenotype. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between AMPK activity
  and MMP‐7 expression in colon cancer cells. The ROS produced by NOX regulate the
  AMPK/MMP‐7 pathway, which can modulate gene expression in tumor cells, thereby enhancing
  their proliferative and invasive capabilities. This is illustrated in Figure 2
