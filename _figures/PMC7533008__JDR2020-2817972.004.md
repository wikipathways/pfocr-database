caption: 'Diagram of the underlying glucometabolic mechanisms on pyruvate protection
  against diabetic nephropathy. Oral pyruvate enters cytosol via the mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier in diabetic db/db mice. Pyruvate reductive reaction with LDH reaction
  couples the NADH oxidation to NAD+ with increase of NAD+/NADH ratio, prompting glycolytic
  flux at G-3-PD step. Pyruvate also stimulates PK and inhibits AR activities, leading
  to inhibit the HG-promoted sorbitol pathway. All restore the inhibited anaerobic
  glycolytic pathway induced by HG. In mitochondria, pyruvate also reactivates the
  HG-declined PDH by direct inhibition of PDK, increasing PDHa/PDHt ratio and glucose
  oxidative phosphorylation in the TCA cycle metabolism, concomitantly reducing the
  blood glucose level. Oral pyruvate competitive inhibition of AR in sorbitol pathway
  increases NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratios. As a result, it restores the suppressed PPP, leading
  to increase of GSH/GSSG ratios in diabetic kidney. Red color: increase; blue color:
  inhibition; red/blue color: untested.'
