caption: Proposed mechanism by which HN-001 protects against MAFLD in mice. As exemplified
  by compound HN-001, inhibition of PLA2 in hepatocytes or in mice decreases LPC content,
  thus blocking the JNK pathway and ameliorating hepatocyte apoptosis. On the other
  hand, a reduction in LPC inhibits IRE-1α activation, leading to XBP-1 splicing inhibition
  and transcriptional regulation blockade and ameliorating ER stress, hepatocyte apoptosis,
  and inflammation. As a result, MAFLD is alleviated.
