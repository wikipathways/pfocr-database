caption: CRM1 regulates the PI3K signaling pathway in MCL. In normal cells, phosphatase
  and tension homolog (PTEN) can inhibit PI3K activation, resulting in the nuclear
  localization of FOXO transcription factors and P27. In the nucleus, FOXO can activate
  the transcription of genes that promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and P27
  can form complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK2) and cyclins to inhibit E2F-mediated
  transcription, leading to cell cycle arrest. In MCL cells without PTEN activity,
  PI3K/AKT signaling is active, resulting in the AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO
  and P27. The phosphorylation of FOXO promotes its nuclear export in a CRM1-dependent
  manner, thereby preventing the activation of its target gene transcription. AKT
  also phosphorylates P27, which disrupts the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of
  P27 and forces it to remain in the cytoplasm. Thus, CDK2 is no longer inhibited
  and is free to activate E2F1 transcription factors, leading to cell proliferation
