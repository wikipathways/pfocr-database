caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms proposed to explain seizure responsiveness
  to vitamin B6 and the potential link with KCNQ2. Several etiopathogenic mechanisms
  have been proposed to explain the responsiveness of certain neonatal seizures to
  vitamin B6 (VitB6), and particularly to its active form, pyridoxal 5′ phosphate
  (PLP). PLP acts as a cofactor of several enzymes, such as Glutamic acid decarboxylase
  (GAD), regulating the synthesis of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) from Glutamate
  (GLUT). A reduction of PLP may determine an imbalance between these two (in favor
  of GLUT), hence decreasing the seizure threshold. PLP is also involved in the synthesis
  of serine (SER) and glycine (GLY), modulating the serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT) activity; thus, a reduction of PLP may determine lower levels of these two
  amino-acids, whose reduction has been related to epileptic phenotypes. SHMT is involved
  in the metabolic pathway, eventually leading to the formation of the main circulating
  form of folates, the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-mTHF), a reduction of which has
  been reported in some patients suffering from pyridoxine-dependent epilepsies (PDE).
  Furthermore, the reduction of 5-mTHF may fall into another proposed mechanism underlying
  epilepsy, namely oxidative stress, with excessive production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). This may be a consequence of low levels of VitB6 (anti-oxidative
  agent) and, at the same time, a cause of folates depletion. Additionally, ROS contribute
  to the peroxidation of several molecules, also affecting ion channels, hence potentially
  KCNQ2. PLP also acts as an antagonist of specific ion channels, as P2X7R, with a
  possible anticonvulsant effect, which could not occur when PLP levels are low. A
  similar antagonist action on KCNQ2, with possible analogous effects, has been proposed.
  Finally, some drugs, especially antiepileptic ones (AEDs), may be responsible for
  the depletion of VitB6 and, indirectly, hyperhomocysteinemia, which is known to
  lower the seizure threshold. Overall, these mechanisms may explain the responsiveness
  of some neonatal seizures to VitB6 treatment and help shed light on the potential
  link with KCNQ2-related epilepsies.
