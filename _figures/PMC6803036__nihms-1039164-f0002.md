caption: (1A). Marginal zone splenic B cells capture sIgM-antigen/complement C3 complexes
  and (B) migrates into the B cell follicle where it transfers the complexes onto
  CR1/2 expressed by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), where (C) the FDC presents
  antigen to germinal cell B cells in support of T-dependent antibody production.
  (2) sIgM strongly supports IgG response development by additional but poorly understood
  processes. (3) Antigen opsonization by sIgM via complement C1q-mediated uptake by
  macrophages. This process can also be mediated by mannose-binding lectin (not shown).
  (4) Pathogen neutralization to blocking pathogen entry or inducing pathogen aggregations.
  Natural IgM is polyreactive and recognizes conserved antigens, such as phosphorylcholine
  (PC) present in the cell walls of Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as on dead or
  dying mammalian host cells. (5) sIgM can recruit complement components to initiate
  the classical pathway of complement activation, eventually leading to the formation
  of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC) that can result in lysis of the pathogen. (6)
  Although the mechanisms are incompletely resolved, sIgM prevents autoimmune antibody
  formation through multiple mechanisms, including effecting central tolerance induction
  in the bone marrow and through the removal of DAMPS, such as dead and dying cell
  debris. (7) The absence of sIgM causes changes in V-gene usage encoding increased
  self-reactivity.
