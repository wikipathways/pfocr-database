caption: TLR and NLR pathways. The TLR pathway is composed of the conserved domain
  toll-IL-1-resistence (TIR), which senses microbial-associated molecular pattern
  (MAMPs) and interacts with the myeloid differentiation primary-response protein
  88 (MyD88). MyD88 drives signaling through NF-kappa B, by interacting with the IL-1R-associated
  kinases 1, 2, and 4 (IRAK1, 2, and 4), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6),
  TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and the inhibitor of kappa B (IKKa, b, and y),
  promoting the activation of proinflammatory cytokines (left). The NLR pathway can
  be activated by bacterial muramyl dipeptide (MDP), interacting with the leucine-rich
  repeat-containing protein (LRR) present in NOD1 and NOD2 structures. Both NOD1 and
  NOD2 can interact with the adaptor molecule RICK (RIP2) via caspase recruitment
  domains (CARD-CARD) and stimulate TRAF6, which drives the activation of other elements
  of NF-kappa B and MAPK pathways, with the consequent production of proinflammatory
  cytokines (right). Additionally, NOD2 can interact with ATG16L1 and stimulate the
  formation of the autophagosome.
