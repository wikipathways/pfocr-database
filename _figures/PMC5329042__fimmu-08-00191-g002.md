caption: Effect of Salmonella infection in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients.
  In genetically susceptible to IBD patients, many parameters are disrupted. (A) Paneth
  cells have an impaired secretion of antimicrobial peptides showing a decrease in
  the amounts of α-defensins, as well as increased amounts of REGIIIγ, which is associated
  with impaired protection against pathogens. (B) Plasma cells have a polarized antibodies’
  secretion to the production of IgG antibodies targeting the individual’s own microbiota.
  Beside this, the proportions of commensal microorganisms present are unbalanced
  related to a healthy host. Due to this imbalance, there is a decrease production
  of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA), which generates an increase in inflammation. Taken
  together, these effects generate an environment more vulnerable to further infection.
  Furthermore, (C) S. Typhimurium recruits neutrophils to the lumen, which generates
  ROS, producing tetrathionate in the intestinal lumen; this compound is used by Salmonella
  as electron acceptor, which gives advantage to S. Typhimurium over the microbiota.
  (D) Salmonella infection is produced by the entry through DCs interspersed in the
  epithelial barrier or M cells that recognize it through glycoprotein-2, accessing
  to the Peyer’s patches. (E) Salmonella can also get into the epithelial cells forming
  membrane ruffling or through disruptions of tight junctions caused by itself and
  in this case especially in inflamed epithelium of IBD patients. (F) In the basolateral
  side, Salmonella can be recognized by TLR5 stimulating an increased production of
  NF-κβ, which correlates with an enhanced recruitment of neutrophils, finally once
  within the epithelial cells, Salmonella blocks the autophagosome pathway avoiding
  its own degradation.
