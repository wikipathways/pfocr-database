caption: HIF pathway applied in liver fibrosis. During the development of liver fibrosis,
  oxygen mediated metabolic reprogramming occurs in a variety of cells. Abnormal lipid
  metabolism and activation of HIF in hepatocytes mediate the fibrotic pathway and
  the activation of HSC cells. Besides, activated HSCs occur in intracellular metabolic
  reprogramming, and they also mediate the metabolic transformation of other parenchymal
  cells. (A) In hepatocytes, activated HIF-1α or HIF-2α stimulates upregulation of
  Cxcl12 through converting latent TGF-β to active TGF-β. Succinate accumulates in
  hepatocytes due to enhanced fatty acid oxidation, which stabilized and activated
  HIF-1α through impairing PHDs. Expression of Cxcl12 and HIF-1α is involved in activation
  of HSCs. (B) In LSECs, PROX1 inhibites HIF‐1α ubiquitination via a deubiquitinase
  called USP19. A possible loop shows that HIF-1α induces PPARγ expression as a hypoxic
  response, then overexpressed PPARγ will inhibit HIF-1α transcription hypoxia as
  a negative feedback. (C) In activated HSCs, HIF-1 upregulates the GLUT1 and PKM2
  expression in exosomes. Then these exosomes are absorbed by KCs, LSECs, and quiescent
  HSCs, which enhanced glycolysis of these nonparenchymal cells. (D) High-fat diet
  and Apoe knockout are common modeling methods of NAFLD. HIF-1 is also involved in
  metabolic disorder in the development of NAFLD to liver fibrosis. In this process,
  cholesterol load increased mitochondrial dysfunction and iNOS levels, which promoted
  HIF-1 stabilization and transcriptional activity. Then, the abnormal activation
  of HIF-1 promoted the production of iNOS and formed a malignant loop for fibrosis.
  Furthermore, HIF-1 is also involved in the circadian locomotor-related metabolic
  disorders in NAFLD. In CLOCK deficiency, HIF1α binds to the Cd36 promoter, promoting
  CD36 expression and uptake of fatty acids in the liver. High fat feeding and AP
  knockout mice are common modeling methods of NAFLD.
