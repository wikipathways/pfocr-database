caption: Current model of LOX-1-dependent signal transduction. (A) Schematic overview
  of the protein domains of murine LOX-1 indicating positions of the intracellular
  domain (ICD), the transmembrane domain (TMD), the neck domain and the ligand binding
  C-type lectin domain (CTLD). The overall domain structure of human LOX-1 is similar
  to that of murine LOX-1. (B) Binding of oxLDL to LOX-1 at the cell surface induces
  various signaling responses. These activate endothelial cells, can lead to endothelial
  dysfunction and finally promote the development of atherosclerotic plaques. The
  initial mechanisms by which LOX-1 initiates signaling are only partly understood.
  An interaction of LOX-1 with the cytosolic proteins ROCK2 and ARHGEF1 was suggested
  to be involved in triggering signal transduction. However, it is not yet clear how
  precisely these proteins couple to downstream pathways and in light of the pleiotropic
  response it seems likely that further mechanisms are involved here. Different downstream
  axes have been described, which may be significantly interconnected. These include
  the GTPases RhoA and Rac, which have been linked with oxLDL-induced production of
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, activation of the NFκB pathway as well
  as other effector kinases including ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases has been reported.
  Several transcriptional targets, which are upregulated by oxLDL-induced LOX-1 activation,
  were identified such as different cytokines/chemokines, adhesion molecules, and
  members of the matrix metalloprotease family.
