caption: In macrophages, P. gingivalis interacts with CD14 and the TLR2/TLR1 signaling
  complex resulting in inside-out signaling for activating and binding CR3, which
  leads to a relatively ‘safe’ uptake of these organisms by macrophages (; ; ). The
  signaling pathway that activates the high-affinity state of CR3 is mediated by Rac1,
  PI3K and cytohesin 1 (Cyt1) (; ; ). P. gingivalis-activated TLR2/TLR1 also induces
  a MyD88-dependnet pathway that can potentially promote the killing of this bacterium
  (; ). However, by means of its fimbriae, P. gingivalis instigates a crosstalk between
  CXCR4 and TLR2 which interferes with this antimicrobial mechanism(). In this study,
  P. gingivalis was shown to also utilize CXCR4 to induce PI3K-dependent activation
  of CR3, independently of TLR2, which further contributes to its capacity to evade
  killing. CXCR4 exploitation requires fully functional fimbriae, i.e., containing
  both the FimA and FimCDE components, which can directly bind CXCR4 ().
