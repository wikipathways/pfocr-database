caption: NK-CAR designs. Early studies exploring CAR-NK cells used CAR constructs
  optimized for T cell signaling and function (A, B). Later, many investigators begin
  to study costimulatory domains specific for NK cell signaling, such as DAP10, DAP12
  or 2B4 (C, D). DAP10 is the adaptor molecule of NKG2D and acts via a Syk-independent
  regulatory pathway (). DAP12 is the adaptor molecules of NKG2C, NKp44 and activating
  killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) and contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motifs (ITAMs) (). 2B4, an important co-stimulation factor of NK activation,
  contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifs (ITSMs) that recruit adaptor
  molecules such as SLAM-associated protein (SAP) to mediate signal transduction ().
  We design a new CARs that replace ITAMs of CD3ζ with FcϵRIγ and DAP12 (E).
