caption: 'The (3R)-acetoin biosynthesis pathway of C. glutamicum. Genes manipulated
  in this study are indicated in red. The bold arrows indicate metabolic fluxes increased
  by overexpression of the corresponding genes. The gray arrows indicate the reactions
  leading to a byproduct or presumably irrelevant reactions. Deleted genes are indicated
  with crosses. Downregulated genes are indicated with dashed arrows. Abbreviations:
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; DHA, dihydroxyacetone;
  G3P, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetate. Genes
  and their encoded enzymes: alsS, acetolactate synthase; alsD, acetolactate decarboxylase;
  ppc, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; pyc, pyruvate carboxylase; icd, isocitrate
  dehydrogenase; gltA, citrate synthase. pta, phosphotransacetylase; ackA, acetate
  kinase; aceE, E1 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; nagD, putative
  phosphatase; butA, 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase'
