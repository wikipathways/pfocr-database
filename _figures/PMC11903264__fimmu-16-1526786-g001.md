caption: 'Schematic diagram of NLRP3 inflammasome composition and activation after
  ICH. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex typically composed of the
  NLRP3 sensor, the ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein), and the pro-caspase-1
  precursor. NLRP3 is a complex multi-domain protein, consisting of three main components:
  the N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), the central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization
  domain (NACHT), and the C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region. ASC is a protein
  containing an N-terminal PYD and a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (CARD).Pro-caspase-1
  consists of two main domains: the CARD and the caspase activation domain. Upon detection
  of danger signals, the PYD domain of NLRP3 binds to ASC, which in turn recruits
  caspase-1 through its CARD domain, leading to the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  In the priming signals, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are capable of recognizing pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which
  in turn trigger the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway activation.
  The activation of NF-κB promotes its translocation to the nucleus, where it binds
  to DNA, thereby enhancing the transcriptional expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and
  pro-IL-18. During the Activation Signals, the NLRP3 inflammasome activation can
  be initiated by various stimuli, including purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R)-mediated
  potassium efflux, intracellular calcium influx, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
  caused by mitochondrial stress, the secretion of mitochondrial DNA or cardiolipin
  from mitochondria, and the release of cathepsin B following lysosomal rupture. Activation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the autocatalytic maturation of pro-caspase-1
  into active caspase-1, which then cleaves the precursors of IL-1β and IL-18 into
  their biologically active mature forms. This figure was created by Figdraw'
