caption: 'HIV infection causes the persistent activation and immune dysfunction. Effective
  healing is usually characterized by a dominant T helper 1 response, whereas a shift
  of the balance towards T helper 2 cells leads to chronic inflammation, which can
  eventually result in fibrosis. There are two types of macrophage activation, i.e.,
  M1 based on the T helper 1-type response, and M2 that is based on the T helper 2-type
  response. The shift to T helper 2 cells, M2 responses, and platelet activation with
  HIV is involved in fibrotic pathway activation. HIV: human immunodeficiency virus,
  IFN-γ: interferon-γ, IL: interleukin, PDGF: platelet-derived growth factor, Th:
  T helper, TGF-β: transforming growth factor-β, TF: tissue factor.'
