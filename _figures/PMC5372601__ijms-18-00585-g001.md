caption: RAS/RAF/MEK aberrant signaling and mechanisms of resistance to inhibition
  in melanoma. Oncogenic BRAFV600E cells become independent from external growth factors
  (GF) (triangle symbol marked with a X) and other stimuli leading to constitutive
  activation of the MAPK pathway. Increased MAPK signalling (four arrows) eventually
  leads to enhanced gene expression including MAP kinase phosphatases (DUSPs) and
  sprouty proteins (SPRYs). Despite elevation of those important inhibitory regulators
  (T lines) of the MAPK pathway, tumour cells adapt and rely on neighbour pathways,
  such as the PI3K pathway, to grow and survive, Furthermore, negative inhibitory
  mechanisms of the MAPK pathway, including inactivation of BRAF via ERK1/2, are now
  lessened (faded T) due to conformational changes in the BRAF. Conferred mechanisms
  of resistance to BRAF inhibitors including up-regulation of PDGFRB, RAS mutations,
  elevation of CRAF, BRAFV600E amplification, alternative splicing of BRAFV600E, elevation
  of COT (MAP3K8), MEK mutation, PTEN loss, PI3K and AKT mutations were highlighted
  in green.
