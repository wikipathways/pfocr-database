caption: Model of the possible subcellular metabolic flow of the DCA pathway. GFA
  is produced by RdPT1 in the plastid of glandular scale cells and then transported
  to the apoplast for the subsequent DCA synthase reaction. The isoprenoid moiety
  of GFA originates from the MEP pathway, although the detailed mechanism of FPP biosynthesis
  in this pathway has yet to be clarified.
