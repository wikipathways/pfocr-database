caption: The cytotoxic immune synapse. Upon TCR recognition of tumoral antigens, CD8+
  T cells activate cytotoxic mechanisms to kill target cells. The two classical cytotoxic
  mechanisms are represented by the release of cytotoxic granules (CGs), with perforin
  and granzymes released into the synaptic cleft, and the Fas/FasL pathway. Together
  with these well-characterized mechanisms of cytotoxicity, a new mechanism based
  on SMAP release contributes to tumoral cell killing. Signals triggered by the inhibitory
  receptors CTLA-4, PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3 antagonize TCR-dependent signaling, causing
  abnormalities in IS assembly and dysfunctions in the lytic granule transport and
  release.
