caption: 'Schematic presentation of dysregulated metabolism of G1 and G2 MDS myeloid
  lineages. (A) Schematic presentation of the proposed metabolic profile of the G1
  MDS differentiating myeloid precursors with predominant glycolysis, marked ceramide
  and phospholipid accumulation, and blunted mitochondrial function in the field of
  aberrant HIF1 stabilization. Line widths reflect the grade of pathway upregulation
  compared to controls. (B) Schematic presentation of the proposed metabolic profile
  of the G2 MDS differentiating myeloid precursors with abundant glycolysis when compared
  to controls, yet with an evidently improved redox status and functional mitochondrial
  TCA through anaplerotic reductive glutamine carboxylation. Line width reflects the
  extent of pathway upregulation compared to controls. SAM: S-Adenosyl-Methionine;
  2-HG: 2-HydroxyGlutarate; OAA: oxaloacetate; a-Ketoglutarate: a-KG; TCA: Tricarboxylic
  Acid Cycle; HIF-1: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1; Acetyl-CoA: Acetyl-Coenzyme A; and
  SuccinylCoA: Succinyl-Coenzyme A. Green arrows indicate enzyme upregulation by HIF-1,
  while the red line shows enzyme inhibition. G1: Differentiating myeloid lineage
  cells isolated from MDS BM aspirates containing <5% blasts. G2: Differentiating
  myeloid lineage cells isolated from MDS BM aspirates containing ≥5% blasts.'
