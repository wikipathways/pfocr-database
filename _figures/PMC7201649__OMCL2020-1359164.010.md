caption: The results of this study demonstrate that exposure to excess Cu can induce
  hepatic oxidative damage by increasing the levels of ROS and PC, suppressing the
  ability to scavenge free radical and reducing the mRNA levels and activities of
  antioxidant enzymes, which in turn leads to hepatic lesions. The increased levels
  of ROS induced by Cu can impair mitochondrial membrane permeability, resulting in
  the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and hepatic apoptosis. Additionally,
  it has been found that the TNF-R1 signaling pathway is involved in Cu-induced apoptotic
  cell death in the mouse liver ().
