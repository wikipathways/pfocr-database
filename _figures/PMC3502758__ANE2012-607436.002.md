caption: Biosynthesis and relationship of shikimic acid to “alternative aspirins”
  and “vanilloids”. The shikimic acid pathway is a key biosynthetic pathway for several
  phytochemicals known for their medicinal attributes. The Figure illustrates the
  biosynthesis of shikimic acid from pyruvic acid and erythrose and the relationship
  between the acid and its byproducts and intermediates, some of which possess aspirin-like
  effects, like analgesia and desickling of sickled RBCs. Such byproducts/intermediates
  include salicyclic acid derivatives, vanillin, piperine, capsaicin, and cubebin.
  Piperine, capsaicin, and cubebin as byproducts of shikimic acid are the likely antisickling
  agents Niprisan []. It is of note that Ouattara [] had attributed the antisickling
  properties Fagara zanthoxyloides to divanilloylquinic acids.
