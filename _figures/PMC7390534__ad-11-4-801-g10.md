caption: The possible mechanism of artemisinin mediated neuroprotection against Aβ1-42-induced
  injury in neuronal cells and in 3xTg mice. Artemisinin stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  in neuronal cells and the brain of 3xTg mice, which results in activation of CREB/Bcl-2
  survival pathway and inhibit apoptosis pathway. This process may reduce oxidative
  stress, correction of mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, artemisinin also reduced
  the inflammatory release and reduced the deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary
  tangles.
