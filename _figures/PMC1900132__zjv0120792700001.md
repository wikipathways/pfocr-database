caption: HCMV MIE promoter/enhancer and its cis-acting elements. The enhancer is divided
  into proximal (−39 to −299) and distal (−300 to −579) portions. Positions of binding
  sites for the initiator complex, C/EBP, CREB/ATF, Gfi-1, AP1, NF-κB, SP1, YY1, ETS2
  repressor factor (ERF), ETS, serum response factor, RA receptor, and the GAS-like
  complex (, ) are shown relative to the +1 RNA start site (leftward arrow) of the
  core promoter. Binding sites for NF-κB, CREB/ATF, and the combination of SP1, YY1,
  and ERF are nested in the 18-, 19-, and 21-bp repeats, respectively. The SP1 site
  depicted in the proximal enhancer exists as two closely spaced sites that are bound
  in vitro by SP1 or SP3 (). IE2 p86 binds to the cis repression signal (CRS-IE2).
