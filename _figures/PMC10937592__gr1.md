caption: Generation and function of SCFAs.GM converts dietary fibre into pyruvate
  by glycolysis, then converts pyruvate into acetate, propionate, and butyrate through
  acetyl CoA, lactic acid and succinate pathways, respectively. Firstly, SCFAs as
  inhibitors of HDACs regulate inflammatory response of NAFLD. Secondly, SCFAs bind
  to GPR41 and GPR43 to promote intestinal endocrine L cells secretion of GLP-1 to
  restrain hepatic steatosis. Thirdly, SCFAs stimulate brown adipose tissue to improve
  NAFLD. Fourthly, SCFAs regulate liver mitochondrial function to improve NAFLD. Fifthly,
  SCFAs maintain energy circulation of body and promote hepatic metabolic balance.
