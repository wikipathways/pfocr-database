caption: Parallels in haematopoiesis between the Drosophila LG and mammalian bone
  marrow. (A) Schematic representation of a Drosophila third instar larva, illustrating
  the presence of circulating and sessile haemocytes of embryonic origin, and showing
  the position of the larval haematopoietic organ (the LG) along the dorsal aorta.
  T and A refer to thoracic and abdominal segments, respectively, and are numbered
  along the anterior-posterior axis. (B) The primary lobe of the LG consists of the
  PSC (blue), the MZ (yellow; containing haemocyte progenitors) and the CZ (red),
  in which differentiation of plasmatocytes and crystal cells takes place. Lamellocytes
  only differentiate in response to specific immune threats, at the expense of progenitors.
  There also exists a population of intermediate progenitors that have left the MZ
  (found within the orange region). Signalling pathways that are active in the PSC
  and MZ are indicated. Tightly controlled levels of ROS sensitise haemocyte progenitors
  to differentiation. Unpaired 3 (Upd3) is one activator of the JAK-STAT pathway,
  and Serrate (Ser) and Jagged are ligands of the Notch receptor. Their specific roles
  in the niche remain little understood. (C) Schematic representation of the quiescent
  LT-HSCs and primed (activated) ST-HSCs and their niches in mammalian bone marrow.
  Signalling pathways involved in the communication between HSCs and their niches
  are indicated. Common lymphoid and common myeloid precursors are indicated as CLP
  and CMP, respectively. Curved arrows indicate cell-autonomous effects within the
  PSC (B) or in LT-HTCs (C).
