caption: Model showing HIF-1α degradation pathway mediated by Pin1/Gsk-3β. In healthy
  hippocampal neurons Gsk-3β phosphorylates the HIF-1α transcription factor on Ser/Thr-Pro
  motif potentially recognizible by Pin1. After phosphorylation Pin1 is able to recognize
  and bind the cis form of HIF-1α (circle form), and catalyzes its isomerization to
  trans conformation (square). The E3 ligase complex having a structural preference
  for phosphorylated substrates in trans conformation to favors ubiquitination and
  the consequent degradation of the transcription factor via proteasome. In post-OGD
  neurons, instead, Gsk-3β is inhibited by phosphorylation on Ser9, therefore HIF-1α
  is not phosphorylated on Ser/Thr-Pro motif resulting unrecognizable by Pin1. Moreover
  Pin1 itself is inhibited by phosphorylation on Ser16, and its enzymatic activity
  is blocked leading to loss of HIF-1α cis/trans isomerization. HIF-1α is not more
  ubiquitinated and degradated via proteasome, accumulating in its cis conformation.
