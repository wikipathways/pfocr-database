caption: Overview of erythritol synthesis from glycerol in the yeast Y. lipolytica.
  Erythrose reductase (ER) is shown in red, other enzymes are shown in blue. The green
  arrows indicate the involvement in the pentose phosphate pathway. Erythrose reductase
  is responsible for the last reaction in the erythritol synthesis pathway, resulting
  in the conversion of erythrose to erythritol.
