caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) mapped to the plant hormone signal
  transduction pathway according to a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
  enrichment analysis. KEGG terms with a corrected P-value less than 0.05 were considered
  to be significantly enriched by DEGs. Five DEGs, comprising JAZ, MYC2, ARR-A, PR1,
  and PP2C, were screened and transcript levels were upregulated, which are shown
  in red letters on yellow blocks in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway.
