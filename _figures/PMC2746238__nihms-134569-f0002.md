caption: 'A. TMPD stimulates IFNα and IFNß production by immature (Ly6Chi) monocytes.
  The IFN-I inducible chemokine MCP-1 (CCL2) is produced following intraperitoneal
  injection of TMPD and promotes the egress of immature monocytes bearing the markers
  CD11b, Ly6Chi, Mac-3, F4/80, and CCR2 (the receptor for MCP-1) from the bone marrow.
  These cells enter the circulation and are recruited to the inflamed peritoneal cavity.
  In mice treated with TMPD, the Ly6Chi monocytes down-that forms in response to the
  hydrocarbon. These cells persist for ∼3 days before undergoing programmed cell death
  (apoptosis). In mineral oil treated mice, the Ly6Chi monocytes rapidly mature in
  the peritoneum to CD11b+, Ly6C−, Mac-3+, F4/80+ cells with numerous endocytic vacuoles.
  In contrast to TMPD elicited monocytes, these cells do not produce IFNα or ß. B.
  IFN-I and pro-inflammatory cytokine production can be stimulated through four main
  cellular pathways employing different adaptor proteins or signaling intermediates:
  i.e. via TRIF (TLRs 3 and 4), MyD88 (TLRs 7, 8, and 9), IPS-1 (Rig-I like helicases,
  RLH)), and TBK1 (receptor not yet clearly defined). The endosomal recognition of
  unmethylated CpG motifs in DNA by TLR9 or of single stranded RNA by TLR7 or TLR8
  leads to the activation of IFNα and ß gene expression via a pathway involving the
  adapter protein MyD88, several kinases (not shown), and the transcription factor
  interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 7. In contrast, the endosomal recognition of
  dsRNA by TLR3 or cell surface recognition of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) by TLR4
  leads to IFNα and ß gene expression via a pathway involving the adapter protein
  TRIF, kinases, and the transcription factor IRF-3. In addition to the endosomal
  pathways, the recognition of cytoplasmic (viral) dsRNA by the RLH Rig-I or Mda5
  leads to the activation of IFNα and ß gene expression via the adapter protein IPS-1
  and the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7. Cytoplasmic DNA is detected by receptors
  that remain to be fully elucidated and signal via the kinase TBK-1, resulting in
  IFNα and ß gene expression. All these pathways converge on nuclear factor kappa
  B (NFκB). The induction of IFNα and ß by TMPD relies exclusively on the TLR7-MyD88-IRF7
  pathway, whereas the other three pathways are dispensable.'
