caption: The mTOR pathway is the “nutrient sensor” of the cell and proximate targets
  of the pathway are responsible for both TOP and cap-dependent translation of proteins.
  Many of these proteins have been shown to be important in cancer progression, angiogenesis,
  autophagy and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR (via TORC1) following
  the formation of a complex with FKBP-12.
