caption: Schema representing the role of lipid transfer proteins in HCV life cycle.
  HCV virus gains entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent uncoating
  of the viral envelope in the endocytic vesicles results in the release of viral
  genome into the cytoplasm. The viral RNA gets translated on the rough ER leading
  to the biosynthesis of viral polyprotein that is subsequently processed by host
  and viral proteases to yield structural and non-structural viral proteins. Viral
  proteins along with other host factors promote the rearrangement of ER-derived membranes
  to establish the viral replication complex. Recruitment and activation of PI4KIIIα
  at viral replication sites leads to enhanced levels of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
  (PI4P) at replication sites resulting in recruitment of the lipid transfer proteins
  OSBP and CERT to the membranes. OSBP and CERT bind to PI4P via their Pleckstrin
  homology (PH) domains and to the ER anchored vesicle-associated membrane-associated
  protein (VAP) by FFAT motif. Both OSBP and CERT bind to their respective lipid ligands
  (i.e., cholesterol or ceramide) through their lipid binding domains and catalyze
  the transfer of cholesterol and ceramide respectively, in exchange for PI4P between
  the ER and virus replication complex. Nir2 facilitates replenishment of PI4P at
  HCV replication sites by coordinating the transfer of PI from ER membranes, which
  can be further converted to PI4P by PI4KIIIα. The assembly of viral genomic RNA
  into nucleocapsid takes place near the replication complexes followed by subsequent
  morphogenesis into virus particle and secretion through the Golgi secretory pathway
  (Created with BioRender.com).
