caption: Interstitial oedema elicited by extracellular trypomastigotes might offer
  a window of opportunity for infection of heart cells via the endothelin/kinin pathways.
  Despite the scanty presence of parasitized heart cells in the myocardium of chronically
  infected Chagasic patients, we may predict that these pseudocysts occasionally burst
  (right/bottom side of panel), releasing high numbers of pro-inflammatory trypomastigotes
  into the surrounding interstitial spaces. On the left side of the panel, innate
  sentinel cells, such as macrophages and endothelin-positive mast cells, initiate
  inflammation through the sensing of microbial TLR2 ligands shed by extracellular
  TCTs. Following TLR2 signalling, activated mast cells may release ET-1, which then
  amplifies inflammation in an autocrine manner through ETR-driven secretion of histamine
  and TNF-α. Acting synergistically with CXC chemokines, these vasoactive mediators
  activate CXCR2 expressed by neutrophils/endothelium (). We hypothesize that the
  ETR/B2R-driven leakage of plasma increases the concentrations of blood-borne kininogens
  and ET-1 (present at high levels in the serum of Chagasic patients) in the trypomastigote-laden
  infection sites (upper side of panel). T. cruzi trypomastigotes may then exploit
  this window of opportunity to invade cardiovascular cells via interdependent activation
  of ETRs and B2R and/or engaging the inducible B1R pathway (). The extracellular
  parasites may also take advantage of the up-regulated activation of ET-1/ETR pathway
  in parasite-infected cardiomyocytes () to persistently infect cardiomyocytes in
  chronic Chagasic patients.
