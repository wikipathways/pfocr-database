caption: Negative feedback regulates the RAS/MAPK pathway. Although MAPK signaling
  was previously considered linear, autoregulatory negative feedback loops precisely
  control signaling output. MEK inhibitors reduce activity of ERK1 and ERK2 and then
  relieve the feedback inhibition of RAF, resulting in enhancement of RAF kinase activity.
  Likewise, ETS1-targeted therapy may activate ERK1 and ERK2 by inhibiting DUSP6,
  which is an ETS1 transcriptional target
