caption: Schematic presentation of molecular mechanisms by which acidosis controls
  the mTORC1 and eEF2K pathway to shut down protein synthesis and aid cancer cell
  survival. Arrows, positive effects or activation; solid “T” lines, inhibition; dotted
  “T” lines, inhibitory effect that is alleviated upon upstream inhibition.
