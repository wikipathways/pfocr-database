caption: Proposed mechanism of CNTF-induced gliosis in the retina after ONC and Pen1-C6DN
  + siCASP2 treatment. (A) After optic nerve crush alone, the low levels of injury-induced
  CNTF bind to the CNTF receptor and suboptimally activate the JAK/STAT pathway and,
  and hence little or no axon regeneration occurs. (B) After optic nerve crush and
  intravitreal delivery of Pen1-C6DN + siCASP2, however, glial activation occurs in
  response to both injury and the presence of Pen1-C6DN + siCASP2. This gliosis leads
  to CNTF release, which further stimulates reactive gliosis in an autocrine manner,
  enhancing CNTF release. In addition, treatment with Pen1-C6DN + siCASP2 also promotes
  release of proinflammatory cytokines from microglia that stimulate further release
  of CNTF from astrocytes and Müller cells. These high titres of CNTF activate the
  CNTF receptor and promote significant RGC axon regeneration through the JAK/STAT
  pathway. (C) In contrast, blocking the gp130 component of the CNTF receptor with
  MAB228 or blocking the JAK/STAT signalling pathway with AG490 blocks the autocrine
  response, suppresses proinflammatory cytokine-induced CNTF release leading to reduced
  CNTF titres, depressed reactive gliosis and hence RGC axon regeneration is prevented.
