caption: Extra-cellular and intra-cellular signalling regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation
  and cardiac regeneration. The cardiomyocyte cell cycle is under the control of several
  molecular regulators. Growth factors and cytokines acting on cell-membrane receptors,
  including IL-6, neuregulin (NRG1), Fslt1, mechanical stress signals, and modification
  in the extracellular matrix, mediated by the protein agrin (which acts through the
  dystrophin glycoprotein complex, DGC), can all stimulate entry of cardiomyocytes
  into the cell cycle. Three main intracellular signal transduction pathways end up
  in the translocation of positive transcriptional co-activators into the nucleus.
  These are YAP, β-catenin, and Notch intracellular domain (ICD). In particular, YAP
  is maintained inactive through phosphorylation by the Hippo kinase cascade and degraded
  through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin
  is also degraded, in non-proliferative conditions, by a destruction complex including
  GSK-3β, which can be inhibited by the small molecule BIO or by the Dishevelled (Dvl)
  protein. Notch is a cell-membrane receptor that, upon binding to ligands expressed
  by neighbouring cells (in particular Jagged1 in the heart) releases its intracellular
  domain that translocates into the nucleus. Similar to all cell types, the cardiomyocyte
  cell cycle is regulated by a number of positive activators (cyclins/CDKs, E2F transcriptional
  factors) and inhibitors (e.g. the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27).
  Several microRNAs interfere with these pathways by modulating the levels of critical
  regulators in the signal transduction pathways or at the level of cell cycle regulation.
  See text for further details.
