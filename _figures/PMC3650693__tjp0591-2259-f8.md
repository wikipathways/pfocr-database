caption: A, insulin binds to insulin receptor (IR) in the mucosal layer triggering
  the canonical signalling pathway of insulin that in turns activates the PI3K/AKT/eNOS
  signalling pathway promoting nitric oxide (NO) release from mucosa to relax the
  detrusor smooth muscle via cGMP production. B, insulin-resistant bladder exhibits
  ER stress characterized by increased TRIB3 levels that causes AKT inactivation in
  bladder mucosa. The downstream signalling pathway to AKT is impaired in mucosa from
  obese mice resulting in reduced NO release and cGMP production and reduced detrusor
  relaxation. IRS, insulin receptor substrate.
