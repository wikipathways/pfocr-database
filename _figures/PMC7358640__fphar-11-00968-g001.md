caption: Schematic representation of the main calcium signaling pathways through Ca2+
  channels and transporters involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis in mammalian
  cells. The calcium influx pathway from the extracellular space is mediated by the
  combined action of the voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs), the store-operated
  calcium channels (SOCCs) and associated proteins (STIM) and the transient receptor
  potential (TRPs) Ca2+ permeable channels. The calcium release pathway from the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and mitochondria is mediated by the inositol triphosphate receptors
  (IP3R) and the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX), respectively. Furthermore,
  the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter
  (MCU) are the responsible for the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ sequestration into organelles.
  Finally, the Ca2+ extrusion pathway from the cytoplasm is regulated by the plasma
  membrane Ca2+ATPase (PMCA1) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX).
