caption: 'The Greatwall–Endosulfine–PP2A-B55 pathway connects TORC1 with the activity
  of the SBF repressor Whi5. In poor nutrients or in a medium with low CDK ctivity,
  activation of the Rim15–Igo1/2 pathway and subsequent inhibition of PP2A-B55 is
  required for the phosphorylation of Whi5 by Cdk1–Cln3 to initiate activation of
  SBF. Later in G1, expression of Cln1 and Cln2 by SBF, together with Cln3, leads
  to complete phosphorylation and inhibition of Whi5, and permits full activation
  of SBF. START: cell cycle transition in G1 where cells commit themselves to one
  round of cell division. SBF: SCB (Swi4/6 cell cycle box)-binding factor.'
