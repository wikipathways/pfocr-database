caption: Potential effects of the disbalance between mitochondrial electron transport,
  TCA cycle, and β-oxidation on skeletal muscle metabolomics in obesity and type 2
  diabetes (scheme). In the state of decreased contractile activity and excessive
  caloric intake, the suppressed ability of mitochondrial electron transport chain
  to oxidize NADH accompanied by excessive activity of CS in TCA cycle or HAD in β-oxidation
  pathway can lead to abnormally high steady-state concentration of intramitochondrial
  and cytoplasmic NADH. The increased concentration of NADH can impair substrate oxidation
  of 2 key enzymes that control oxidation of glucose and fatty acids, pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDC) and HAD, respectively. Thus the defect in mitochondrial electron transport
  chain can lead to general slowdown of basal metabolism in skeletal muscle, and perhaps
  it can result in decreased rate of ATP generation during contractile activity. Inhibition
  of PDC can divert more pyruvate to oxaloacetate and to citrate that can leak from
  mitochondria to cytoplasm. Excessive cytoplasmic citrate can be a precursor for
  acetyl-CoA and acyl-CoAs. Accumulation of array of metabolite byproducts and the
  products of incomplete oxidation of fatty acids and glucose in skeletal muscle of
  individuals adopting sedentary lifestyle and overeating could be a major cause of
  insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.
