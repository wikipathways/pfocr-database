caption: Genome engineering Drosophila TGF-β/BMP signaling. (A) Overview of the TGF-β/BMP
  signaling pathway, with an emphasis on components that have been modified in this
  study (shown in color). (B) Two-step genome-engineering strategy exemplified with
  Sax. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair was used to replace the target
  sequence with an attP-containing cassette. After removal of the dsRed selection
  marker, the genomic locus was restored with tagged versions of the gene by standard
  ФC31 transgenesis. The mini-white selection marker was excised by Cre recombinase.
  Exact strategies for the other TGF-β/BMP components are depicted in Fig. S1. Note
  that, in the case of Dally, Pent, Tkv and Put, homologous recombination as described
  in Baena-Lopez et al. (2013) was used to generate the attP,KO lines. bp, base pairs;
  CDS, coding sequence; UTR, untranslated region. (C) In-scale overview of tagged
  TGF-β/BMP components to visualize the position of the tag (shown in color) in relation
  to protein domains. At least one but up to five tagged variants are available for
  all components. For simplicity, all components tagged with 3×HA are termed HA-X
  or X-HA. Note the exception of Tkv, for which the 3×HA-tagged version is termed
  Tkv-3×HA, a single HA-tagged version is termed Tkv-HA, and versions tagged with
  a single copy of HA and eGFP are termed Tkv-HAeGFP and Tkv-eGFPHA. Variants marked
  by an asterisk are not viable in homozygosity. Grey rectangles at the glypicans
  indicate the position of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment site.
