caption: Proline biosynthetic pathway in E. coli. The enzyme ProB converts glutamate
  to γ-glutamyl phosphate which is then reduced to glutamic acid 5-semialdehyde by
  ProA. Glutamic acid 5-semialdehyde spontaneously rearranges to form Δ1-Pyrroline
  5-carboxylate which is converted by ProC, to proline, a known inhibitor of ProB.
