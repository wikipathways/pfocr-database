caption: 'Inflammatory signalling pathways in AIDs. The first step of inflammatory
  response is the recognition of pathogens’ conserved structures (PAMP) by PPR of
  intracellular sensors (including NLR domains, ALR and pyrine), with the formation
  of a multimeric proteic complex, called inflammasome. The inflammasome receptors
  interact with the adapter protein ASC, leading to the activation of Caspase 1, which
  converts pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to their bioactive forms. Caspase 1 also cleavages
  the Gasdermin-D (GSDMD), whose N-terminal domain (GSDMD-N) forms cytotoxic pores
  in the lipidic cellular membrane, causing pyroptosis. Also, PAMPs are sensed by
  TLRs (mainly TLR-4) or NOD2 receptors and activate NF-κB pathway, enhancing NLRP-3
  transcription. The intra-cytoplasmic accumulation of viral or endogenous nucleic
  acids is sensed by others proteins, like cGAS, MDA5 and DDX58, which activate STING
  and therefore IR3-IR7 factors. These latter translocate to the nucleus, stimulating
  the transcription of type I IFN genes. STING also directly activates NFkB signalling.
  Most of the described signalling pathways activate NF-κB signalling, thus stimulating
  the transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes (NLRP3, pro-IL-β, pro-IL-18, and IL-6)
  and promoting a positive feedback effect. Alterations at different levels of this
  complex mechanism are associated with the development different AIDs. Abbreviations:
  PAMP (pathogen associated molecular patterns); PRR (pattern recognition receptors);
  NLR (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors); ALR (Absence
  in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors); NLRP-3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing
  3); NF-κB (NF-kappaB); IFN (interferon); IRF (IFN regulatory factor); CGAS (cyclic
  GMP-AMP synthase); MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; DDX58 (DExD/H
  box RNA helicase); STING (Stimulator of interferon genes).'
