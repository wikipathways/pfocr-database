caption: 'Hypothetical pathway for complement-mediated inflammation of the pulmonary
  alveolus in COVID-19: (1) SARS-CoV-2 attaches to type II alveolar epithelial cell
  (AEC-II) receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). (2) Complement activation
  is initiated upon recognition of viral glycans by lectins (e.g. collectin-11 and
  ficolin-1, which are secreted by AEC-II) complexed with MBL-associated serine proteases
  (MASPs) including MASP-2. Direct binding of MASP-2 to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2
  has also been suggested to initiate lectin pathway activation (preprint: Gao et al.).
  (3) Complement deposition and MAC formation on AECs cause inflammasome activation
  and cell damage. (4) Release of complement C5a increases vascular permeability and
  recruitment/activation of polymorphs (PMN) and monocytes (MC) to the alveolus. (5)
  Monocytes differentiated into inflammatory macrophages (MΦ) overproduce pro-inflammatory
  cytokines in response to C3a and C5a stimulation. (6) Endothelial cell (EC) activation
  by C5a and MAC predisposes to thrombus formation, further enhanced through MBL recognition
  of viral particles in the vascular compartment leading to cleavage of thrombin and
  fibrinogen by MASPs. (Adapted from Polycarpou et al.)'
