caption: Joint analysis of KEGG and different algorithms was performed to identify
  the putative and experimentally validated targets for the most differently expressed
  miRNAs in two groups. Part of the pathway was displayed here. MiRNAs marked red
  are up-regulated while the blue ones are down-regulated.
