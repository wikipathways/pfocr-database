caption: 'Possible cell death mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV-2 proteins and cytokine
  production. (A) SARS-CoV-2 E protein stimulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)
  signaling pathway, leading to the production and release of inflammatory cytokines.
  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), binding their receptor,
  can trigger three different mechanisms: (1) apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway;
  (2) necroptosis through the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like
  (MLKL); (3) pyroptosis by the cleavage of inactive full-length gasdermin into its
  active form that can form membrane pores. (B) E protein contributes to the loss
  of ionic balance by facilitating Ca2+ leakage from endoplasmic reticulum into the
  cytosol, together with viral membrane-associated protein ORF3a that mediates the
  efflux of K+. The consequent mitochondrial damages and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  production activate NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome which
  induces pyroptosis. (C) Cytosolic ORF3a can activate NLRP3 by the promotion of TNFR-associated
  factor 3 (TRAF3) -mediated ubiquitination of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD (ASC), enhancing the pyroptosis pathway. (D) Crosstalk between
  the main cell death pathways that occurs during SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the
  phenomenon of PANoptosis.'
