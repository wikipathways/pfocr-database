caption: Summary of the modes of action of selected small molecules that modulate
  morphogenesis in Candida albicans. (A) Several small molecules, including farnesol
  (FOH), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), rapamycin (Rapa), geldanamycin (GdA), mucin,
  diclofenac sodium, 1,4-diamino-2-butanone (DAB), hydroxyurea (HU), propranolol,
  and bathophenanthrolene disulfonic acid (BPS), modulate morphogenesis by targeting
  the Ras1p-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and its downstream effectors. Notably, both
  CLA and GdA modulate morphogenesis independently of Efg1p. Extended CRIB (eCRIB)
  peptides interrupt the binding of the GTPase Cdc42p to its effectors Cst20p and
  Cla4p, and thus prevent the activation of the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway. (B) Farnesol
  and CLA block the downregulation of TUP1 and NRG1 expression. In contrast, rapamycin
  induces the downregulation of both repressors by inhibiting TOR. (C) Trichostatin
  A (TSA) induces filamentation by relieving the Set3C-mediated repression of Efg1p-dependent
  transcription. TSA may also reduce EFG1 transcript levels (see text for details).
  HSGs, hypha-specific genes.
