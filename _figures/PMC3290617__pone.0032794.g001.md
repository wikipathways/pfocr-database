caption: Activation of monocytes in the circulation is characterized by increased
  activation of the inflammatory toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2)/NFκB signaling pathway.
  Activation of this pathway will elicit pro-inflammatory cytokine release (e.g. tumor
  necrosis factor α (TNFα)), mitochondrial and intracellular ROS production and impairment
  of the insulin sensitivity at the molecular level. More mitochondrial ROS production
  is associated with an increased expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant superoxide
  dismutase-2 (SOD2), suggesting that SOD2 only acts as mitochondrial stress marker
  (indicated as dotted line). The formed ROS will not only induce the IKK complex
  phosphorylation and thereby the translocation of NFκB but will also lead to inhibition
  of the insulin receptor signaling pathway. Interestingly, interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase-3 (IRAK3) and miR-146b-5p are located upstream of the transcription factor
  NFκB and negatively regulates TLR signaling. IRAK3 prevents the dissociation of
  IRAK1 and IRAK4 from MyD88 and formation of IRAK-TRAF6 complexes. miR-146b-5p, on
  the other hand, inhibits the translation of IRAK1 and TRAF6. Flow of the pathway
  at the protein interaction level is indicated by black arrows. Blunted arrows indicate
  inhibition. Phosphorylation is indicated by a circled P.
