caption: Model-II signaling Pathway and Logical Network of the Speract-Activated Signaling
  Pathway (SASP). (A) Scheme of the signaling pathway triggered by speract in S. purpuratus
  sperm flagellum. The SASP starts with the binding of speract to its receptor and
  after several steps, which include changes in membrane potential, oscillations in
  [Ca 2+]i are attained. (B) Biochemical events related to (A). (C) Network model
  of the signaling pathway. Each node on the network represents an element of the
  pathway. Black arrows indicate activation; red lines indicate inhibition and the
  dashed yellow arrows can both activate and inhibit depending on the value of voltage
  V. Voltage can have a hyperpolarized state, represented with a value of 0; resting
  potential, 1 and a depolarized state, which is represented with a value of 2.
