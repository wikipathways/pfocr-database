caption: Main molecular mechanisms underlying EMT activation. Transforming growth
  factor-β (TGF-β) receptor activation induces a classical mother against decapentaplegic
  (SMAD) pathway, as well as ‘nonclassical’ pathway, such as mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPKs), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR), or Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases), which induce EMT-TFs such as
  Snail1 and TWIST1. Besides their activity as transcriptional regulators, they control
  the expression of mesenchymal genes and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such
  as fibronectin and collagens, whose production is increased during EMT. The alteration
  of ECM composition causes changes in expression and activation of integrins, which
  promote migratory proprieties of cancer cells. Integrin signaling in turn sustains
  EMT induction through extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and Rho GTPases
  signaling pathways. Tyrosine receptor ligands (EGF, HGF) and cytokines, such as
  IL-6 and VEGF, are other factors involved in EMT activation through ERK, PI3K, and
  NF-κB pathways.
