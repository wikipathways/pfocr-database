caption: Proposed model of AKAP13 and PR-B signaling in fibroids. Our working model
  suggests that AKAP13 augments ligand-dependent activity of PR-B through ERK, possibly
  through close interaction of PR-B with AKAP13. Because AKAP13 is an essential regulator
  of the transcription factor YAP in mechanotransduction, it may potentially regulate
  PR activity through crosstalk with the Hippo pathway. Red = actin filament; blue
  box = integrin complex. VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. AKAP13 activates
  Rho (+) and is capable of augmenting ligand-dependent PR activity (+). PR then may
  affect gene transcription. The involvement of AKAP13 in both processes suggests
  integration of mechanical and progesterone signaling. Arrows suggest possible relationships
  of the factors in the pathway.
