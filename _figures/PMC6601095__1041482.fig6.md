caption: Gradient-triggered activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway controls signaling
  from stimulatory G protein-coupled receptors. Signaling pathways with a net stimulatory
  effect on platelet activation are colored red and signaling pathways with a net
  inhibitory effect are colored blue. (A) In the presence of high agonist concentration
  gradients, strong activation of multiple stimulatory pathways will produce Akt phosphorylation,
  which in itself results in inhibition of the cAMP dependent pathway by stimulation
  of PDE3 activity. (B) In the presence of low agonist concentration gradients, gradient-dependent
  activation of the cAMP-dependent pathway will counteract stimulatory signaling from
  G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), resulting in a refractory state characterized
  by an absence of Akt phosphorylation but prominent VASP phosphorylation and non-responsiveness
  to high concentrations of agonists. As proof of the involvement of the cAMP-dependent
  pathway in gradient-dependent inhibition (GDI), we found that GDI was effectively
  shut off by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with epinephrine, and partially reversed
  by inhibition of PKA with H89, while GDI was potentiated by stimulation of the cAMP-dependent
  pathway with PGI2 or milrinone.
