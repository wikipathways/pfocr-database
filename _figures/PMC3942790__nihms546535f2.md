caption: Hepcidin expression is increased in response to elevated iron and decreased
  due to ineffective erythropoiesis, such as is found in β-thalassemia intermedia.
  Mutations in the classic hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) and hemojuvelin (HJV)
  cause hereditary hemochromatosis. HJV, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptor,
  plays a central role in hepcidin regulation through a SMAD signaling cascade. BMP6
  expression increases with elevated iron conditions and acts as a ligand, binding
  to HJV and initiating hepcidin expression. Diferric transferrin (TF-Fe) displaces
  HFE from transferrin receptor-1 (TFR1) likely leading to interaction with the HJV/BMP
  receptor complex, or a possibly separate signaling pathway. The membrane-bound serine
  protease TMPRSS6 cleaves HJV from the cell surface, forming a soluble protein (sHJV).
