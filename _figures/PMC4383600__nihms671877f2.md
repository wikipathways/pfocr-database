caption: The interplay between multiple factors in the transforming growth factor-β
  (TGF-β) signalling pathway and the control of muscle mass. Myostatin and similar
  members of the TGF-β superfamily can activate small mother of decapentaplegic (Smad)2/3
  and drive transcriptional events that result in the transcription of genes that
  limit muscle size. This can be prevented at a variety of drug/protein inhibitors
  (indicated in the red text and red bars). Smad2/3 signalling can also be blocked
  by growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) and other members of the TGF-β superfamily
  that activate Smad1/5/8, and this competes for Smad4 binding and shifts transcription.
  Resistance exercise can also limit Smad2/3 signalling by activating Notch and blocking
  Smad2/3 transcription. bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1 (BMPR1); dominant negative
  (DN); and myostatin (MSTN).
