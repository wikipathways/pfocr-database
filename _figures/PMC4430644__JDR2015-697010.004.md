caption: A schematic summary of the various therapeutic agents that have been identified
  in the metabolic and alternative pathways is shown below. As noted in , a hyperglycemic
  milieu shunts glucose metabolism away from the classic glycolysis pathway as is
  typically seen in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Sodium-glucose cotransport
  (SLGT2) inhibitors and Sirt1 activators play a role in alternative pathway and are
  noted in the upper left. SLGT2 inhibitors combat hyperglycemia by inducing glucosuria,
  whereas Sirt1 activators are thought to upregulate the highly conserved mechanism,
  autophagy.
