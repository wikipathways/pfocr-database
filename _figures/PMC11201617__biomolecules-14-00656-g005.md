caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. In the absence of the binding of DHH, IHH, or
  SHH proteins to PTCH, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate PI(4)P binds to PTCH, thereby
  inhibiting the G protein-coupled SMO. SMO then interacts with SENP, resulting in
  the ubiquitination and degradation of the complex. When a ligand (DHH, IHH, SHH)
  binds to the CDO/BOC protein and the PTCH receptor, it triggers the activation of
  the G protein-coupled SMO receptor. This activation leads to the cleavage of Glis,
  releasing their active form from a protein complex in the cytoplasm. The activated
  protein is translocated in the nucleus, initiating the transcription of genes implicated
  in proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. DHH—Desert
  Hedgehog protein; IHH—Indian Hedgehog protein; SHH—Sonic Hedgehog protein; CDO/BOC—cysteine
  dioxygenase/brother of cysteine dioxygenase; PTCH—multitransmembrane protein patched;
  SMO—receptor smoothened; SENP—SUMO-specific peptidase protein; Glis—glioma-associated
  oncogene transcription factors
