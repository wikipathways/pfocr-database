caption: Cytoplasmic cholesterol is transferred to the inner mitochondrial membrane
  by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), also called translocator protein
  (TSPO), or peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. In the mitochondria, cholesterol
  is converted to pregnanolone by enzyme cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (P450scc)
  in a rate-limiting step. Pregnanolone is transferred back to the cytoplasm and gets
  converted to progesterone by enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD). Circulating
  progesterone can also enter the neurosteroid synthetic pathway at this step. Subsequently,
  progesterone is converted to dihydroprogesterone by the enzyme 5α-reducatse (5α-R)
  in the 2nd rate-limiting step in this biosynthetic pathway. Finally, dihydroprogesterone
  is converted to tetrahydroprogesterone (THP), also called allopregnanolone, by the
  enzyme 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-HSD). Progesterone can also be converted
  to deoxycorticosterone and then to allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC). Both
  allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone can activate GABAA receptors
  expressed in the same cell or surrounding cells.
