caption: Non-canonical mechanism of cell cycle inhibition by p27kip1. From a molecular
  point of view, p27kip1 (p27) controls the Ras-MAPK pathway through the modulation
  of Stathmin (Stm1) activity, thereby limiting ERK1/2-dependent transcription of
  early response genes such as EGR-1, c-Fos, and Jun-b, and, eventually, cell proliferation.
  On the left, cells expressing normal levels of wild-type p27 are depicted. Following
  extracellular stimuli (ECS) such as growth factors, H-Ras is activated at the plasma
  membrane, leading to a certain amount of MAPK pathway activation. Among other kinases,
  activated ERK (pERK) phosphorylates p27 (p27-P) and leads to its cytoplasmic displacement.
  In the cytoplasm, p27 interacts with Stathmin, leading to modulation of microtubule
  dynamics and endosomal vesicle trafficking. H-Ras is temporarily retained in Rab-5–positive
  vesicles, where it becomes mono- or bi-ubiquitinated and loses some of its activity.
  In this setting, the restriction point (R) of the cell cycle is not bypassed and
  the cell does not proliferate. If the external stimulus persists, p27 will be further
  phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and finally degraded. This loss of p27 expression
  (also depicted in the right panel, exemplified by p27 knockout cells) releases the
  brake from full H-Ras/MAPK pathway activation, leading to the activation of a transcriptional
  program that will take the cell from the G1 to S phase of the cell cycle and eventually
  result in cell proliferation.
