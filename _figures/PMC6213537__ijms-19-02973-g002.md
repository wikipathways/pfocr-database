caption: Involvement of MAPKs in processes that lead to Parkinson’s disease pathology.
  Different stimuli (stress stimuli, growth factors, cytokines, mitogens, pathogens,
  toxins) induce activation of MAPK pathways including activation of MAPKKK and MAPKK
  followed by phosphorylation of downstream targets such as JNKs, p38 MAPKs, and ERK1/2.
  JNKs and p38 MAPKs are grouped together due to their involvement in the “death pathway”
  (marked in red) while ERK1/2 is believed to promote cell growth and differentiation
  (marked in green). Activation of JNKs and p38 MAPKs promote oxidative stress and
  apoptosis, which are main contributors to PD pathogenesis. Oxidative stress may
  also cause microglial activation and chronic inflammation, which are toxic for brain
  cells and leads to PD pathology. In addition, ERK1/2 contribute to apoptosis of
  brain cells through the activation of NFAT and p53 and to neuronal inflammation
  through the activation of STATs. Both ERK1/2 and JNKs activate mTOR signaling, which
  promotes neurodegeneration such as that observed in PD.
