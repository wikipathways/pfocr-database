caption: 'Simplified summary of mutated and/or dysregulated genes in human and mouse
  osteosarcoma (OS) that participate in the mTROC1 signaling pathway. In the presence
  of growth factors (e.g. Insulin) or other stimuli, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
  intracellular domains are trans-phosphorylated, leading to the recruitment of the
  regulatory subunit of class IA PI3K, p85 (encoded by gene PIK3R1) and release of
  the catalytic subunit p100 (encoded by gene PIK3CA). One of the signaling components
  activating PI3K is Ras. Binding of a ligand to RTKs promotes dimerization of the
  receptor and subsequent autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues. This allows the
  RTK to interact with SH2 domain–containing proteins, such as Growth Factor Receptor
  Bound Protein 2 (GRB2), that can bind and activate Son of Sevenless (SOS), which
  in turn, activates RAS. Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) negatively regulates this process.
  Thus, p110 is activated by RAS independently of p85. Upon activation, PI3K catalyzes
  the formation of the second messenger phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)
  at the plasma membrane, which can be down-regulated by the tumor suppressor, phosphatase
  and tensin homolog (PTEN). Increased PIP3 levels lead to the recruitment of PIP3-binding
  proteins, such as Protein Kinase B Alpha (Akt) and PDK1. At the membrane, PDK1 (encoded
  by PDPK1) phosphorylates Akt at Thr308 leading to partial activation of Akt. Akt
  then phosphorylates varied substrates, including tuberin (encoded by TSC2), an inhibitor
  of mTORC1. This results in the activation of Ras Homolog Enriched in Brain (Rheb).
  Activated Rheb binds to and activates mTORC1. Active mTORC1 promotes protein synthesis,
  lipogenesis, and energy metabolism, but inhibits autophagy and lysosome biogenesis.
  Other regulators of mTORC1 in OS, including Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) and Glycogen Synthase
  Kinase 3 Beta (GSK3b), which mediates Wnt signaling to phosphorylate and promote
  TSC2 activity and p53 in response to DNA damage. Rapamycin selectively inhibits
  mTORC1. Round shape: oncogene. Rectangular shape: tumor suppressor gene (TSG). Red
