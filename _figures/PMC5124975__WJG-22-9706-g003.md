caption: Galectin-3 and IL-33/ST2 axis interaction in diet-induced steatohepatitis.
  Administration of IL-33 in vivo enhanced high-fat diet-induced liver fibrosis in
  both genotypes of mice, although to a markedly lower extent in the galectin-3 knockout
  mice, which was accompanied by less numerous ST2-positive myeloid cells that express
  IL-13. Galectin-3 plays an important regulatory role in the newly described profibrotic
  IL-33/ST2/IL-13 pathway in hepatic fibrosis.
