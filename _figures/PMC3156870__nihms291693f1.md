caption: Resistance to RAF inhibitor (i) blockade of signaling through the MEK-ERK1/2
  pathway can occur via acquired mutation in N-RAS (Q61K or Q61R) or up-regulation
  of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). These mechanisms enhance RAS activity, which
  promotes C-RAF dimerization and activation. MEK-ERK1/2 pathway activation can also
  occur through mutations in the B-RAF target, MEK1 (P124L), and via up-regulation
  of the MAP3K, Cot1. Activation of the parallel PI-3 kinase-Akt pathway is promoted
  by loss of PTEN expression/activity often through mutation and up-regulation of
  RTKs including IGF-1R and possibly PDGFRβ. Re-activation of the ERK1/2 pathway and
  PI-3K-Akt signaling promote G1/S cell cycle events including cyclin D1 up-regulation
  and down-regulation of the cyclin-dependent inhibitor, p27Kip1. Additionally, these
  pathways promote survival events by promoting expression of the anti-apoptotic protein,
  Mcl-1, as well as down-modulating levels of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins,
  Bim-EL and Bmf. Alterations in the expression of these cell cycle and survival proteins
  may also promote resistance to RAF inhibitors.
