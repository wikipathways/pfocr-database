caption: The Hippo pathway, which consists of a core MST1/2-LATS1/2 kinase cassette
  and numerous regulatory proteins including NF2/Merlin, SAV1, MOB1, MOB3B, phosphorylates
  and inhibits YAP/TAZ by targeting them for cytoplasmic retention and proteasomal
  degradation mediated by 14-3-3 and β-TrCP, respectively. Inactivation of Hippo signaling
  promotes stabilization and nuclear entry of YAP/TAZ, where they form transcription
  complexes with TEAD1–4, AP-1, BRD4, ZEB1, E2F and possibly other transcription factors
  to induce the expression of pro-survival/anti-apoptotic genes such as CTGF, CYR61,
  Bcl-xL and Survivin. YAP/TAZ have been identified as major drivers of resistance
  to RAF and MEK inhibitors as single agents or in combination with TBK1 inhibitor
  in BRAF and KRAS mutant cancer cells. BRAFi treatment induces actin cytoskeletal
  remodeling and promotes Rho-mediated YAP nuclear entry in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells.
  YAP induces E2F and AP-1-mediated cell cycle and EMT transcriptional programs to
  promote survival following ablation of oncogenic Kras in pancreatic and colon cancer
  cells. Additionally, YAP/TAZ induce EGFRi resistance by increasing the expression
  of AXL, ERBB3 and EGFR.
