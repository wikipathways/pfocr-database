caption: On stimulation with taste receptor agonists, the G-protein subunits Gα-gustducin
  and Gβγ dissociate from the G-protein coupled receptor. Subsequently, Gα-gustducin
  activates phosphodiesterase (PDE), which depletes cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP) by converting it into adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Under normal conditions,
  the presence of cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which inhibits several elements
  of the parallel Gβγ-mediated pathway. When released, Gβγ triggers phospholipase
  Cβ2 (PLCβ2), which produces inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) from the phospholipid
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Once produced, IP3 activates the type
  3 IP3 receptor (IP3R3) on the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing calcium stores. Increased
  intracellular calcium opens the nonspecific cation channel TRPM5 (transient receptor
  potential cation channel subfamily M member 5), further depolarizing the cell and
  resulting in transmitter release.
