caption: Enrichment of altered m6A-tagged transcripts in the major signaling pathways.
  (A) Enrichment of m6A-tagged transcripts in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  signaling pathways, m6A peaks in the genes highlighted with orange are up-regulated.
  (B) Enrichment of m6A-tagged transcripts in nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling
  pathwaysm6A peaks in the genes highlighted with orange are up-regulated. (C) Enrichment
  of m6A-tagged transcripts in protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathway,
  m6A peaks in the genes highlighted with yellow are down-regulated. (D) Enrichment
  of m6A-tagged transcripts in spliceosome pathway, m6A peaks in the genes highlighted
  with yellow are down-regulated.
