caption: Cancer and its treatments cause chronic systemic inflammation that leads
  to Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal axis dysfunction that results in increased cortisol
  production. Increased cortisol production coupled with chronic inflammation causes
  mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle cells. This mitochondrial dysfunction and chronic
  inflammation leads to an increase in circulating myostatin/activing, which upregulates
  the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in muscle cells, and leads to uncontrolled muscle
  wasting
