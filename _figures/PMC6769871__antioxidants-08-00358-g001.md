caption: Polyamine biosynthesis pathway and its linkage to ethylene biosynthesis pathway.
  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a precursor for ethylene biosynthesis which is synthesized
  from methionine by SAM synthase. The generated SAM is then converted to ethylene
  by the action of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic
  acid oxidase enzymes. SAM also gets decarboxylated upon SAM decarboxylase (SAMdC)
  action and can act as precursor for spermidine and spermine synthesis. Putrescine
  can be directly synthesized from ornithine by the action of ornithine decarboxylase
  or indirectly from arginine by arginine decarboxylase.
