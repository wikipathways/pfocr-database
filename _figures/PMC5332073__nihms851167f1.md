caption: Schematic illustration of the dendrimer-based nanoplatform for targeted delivery
  of DJ-1 siRNA to the ovarian cancer cells via LHRH receptor-mediated endocytosis
  and the role of siRNA-induced suppression of DJ-1 protein in the combinatorial treatment.
  siRNA-mediated knockdown prevents DJ-1 protein from (A) inhibiting the PTEN expression,
  thereby promoting phosphorylation of Akt and activating cell proliferation and migration;
  (B) suppressing p53 transcriptional activity, therefore inhibiting the apoptotic
  p53-Bax-caspase pathway and cell cycle arrest functionality; (C) protecting cancer
  cells from intrinsic oxidative stress and the consequent ROS-mediated apoptosis.
  DJ-1 facilitates GSH synthesis via upregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme glutamate
  cysteine ligase (GCL). In addition, DJ-1 stabilizes NRF2, which is responsible for
  both GSH recycling via modulating the activity of glutathione reductase (GR) and
  transcriptional activation of various antioxidant proteins.
