caption: 'Putative molecular effects of MSC-secretome on latency-reactivation from
  tissue HIV-1 reservoirs. (A) Schematics of possible interactions between MSCs &
  latently-infected cells within tissue HIV-1 reservoirs. The following steps may
  be involved in persistence, propagation and transmission of HIV-1 from reservoirs
  microenvironments: (1) Factors secreted from latently-infected cells (MACs & THLs)
  may recruit tissue-resident MSCs; (2) these reservoir-recruited MSCs may closely
  interact with latently-infected cells, where reciprocal signaling (cell-to-cell
  and/or secretome-mediated) may facilitate virus reactivation; (3) the reservoir-recruited
  MSCs may also be activated to secrete factors that constantly reactivate HIV-1 from
  latency, generating an inflammatory microenvironment that enable further recruitment
  of infectable cells; and (4) these productively infected reservoir cells may then
  migrate into the blood and enable rapid viral rebound. (B) Signaling pathways involved
  in MSC-secretome (ASC-CM) mediated HIV-1 reactivation from latently-infected MACs
  (U1 cells). The potent suppressive effects of LY294002 & PX-866 implicate a direct
  role for the PI3K signaling pathway. The potent effect of Bardoxolone-Methyl (CDDO-Me)
  also suggests that NF-κB activation is a mechanism of this latency-reactivation.
  Interestingly however, increased reactivation by the AKT inhibitor (124005) and
  decreased reactivation by the AKT activator (SC-79) also suggest the involvement
  of a non-canonical PI3K-NFκB dependent pathway, where the downstream AKT pathway
  has a negative regulatory effect on MSC-mediated latency-reactivation from tissue
  resident MACs.'
