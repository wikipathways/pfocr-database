caption: DEGs in the KEGG pathways of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (A),
  and peroxidase (B) in AE8, compared to the parental line of B. napus. The grids
  of red and blue in the metabolic pathway indicate the enrichment of up-regulated
  and down-regulated DEGs, and the adjacent squares indicate the differentially expression
  genes. The color in the square represents expression changes based on the log2 fold.
  The full list of significantly enriched KEGG pathways for DEGs is given in .
