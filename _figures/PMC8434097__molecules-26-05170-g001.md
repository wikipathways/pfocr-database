caption: Schematic representation of the pathway induced by AURK and PLK. Both PLK
  and AURK phosphorylates CDC25 (cell cycle division 25), allowing CDK (cyclin-dependant
  kinase)/Cyclin B complex activation and thus permitting transition of the cell from
  the G2 phase to the M phase (mitotic entry). PLK facilitates this process by inhibiting
  the CDK inhibitor Wee1. Inactivation of PLK or AURK shows a marked delay in both
  CDK activation and mitotic entry.
