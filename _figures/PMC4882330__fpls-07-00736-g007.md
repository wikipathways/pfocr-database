caption: Overview of melatonin action on the delay of PPD of cassava tuberous roots.
  At early stage of the PPD process, coincidently with oxidative burst, melatonin
  acted on inducing cells to sense and transduct ROS signaling through calcium signaling
  and related transcription factors, thus resulting in the induction of ROS-scavenging
  genes to relieve ROS injury and delay of PPD. Melatonin-mediated starch degradation
  may provide energy for the active ROS-scavenging process at early stage of PPD.
  At middle and late stages, melatonin function on repressing starch degradation,
  benefit for improving food characteristics and quality of cassava. During all three
  stages, the repression of starch synthesis pathway by melatonin may represent an
  action of melatonin-mediated saving resources of cells in tuberous roots.
