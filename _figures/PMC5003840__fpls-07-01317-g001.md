caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway to the synthesis of xanthanolides. GAO, germacrene
  A oxidase; COS, costunolide synthase; PTS, parthenolide synthase; GAA, germacrene
  A acid; STL, sesquiterpene lactone. Germacrene A is successively oxidized by the
  GAO at its C12 methyl group to yield GAA. GAA then can be hydrolyzed by a P450 at
  its C6 position for the biosynthesis of C6–C7 STLs, e.g., costunolide and parthenolide,
  or at its C8 position for the formation of C7–C8 end STLs, e.g., xanthanolides such
  as xanthatin and xanthumin. From our knowledge of the structures of xanthanolides,
  the biosynthetic steps from GAA to xanthanolides may involve cytochrome P450s, dehydrogenases
  and acetyltransferases. The pathway steps indicated by solid lines are supported
  by previous research, while indicated by dotted lines are proposed by this study.
