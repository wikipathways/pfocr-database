caption: Clinical benefits of metformin in multiple systems. The multi-targeted actions
  of metformin are mediated both by the adenosine monophosphate activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) pathway and non-AMPK pathways. In the liver, metformin reduces glycogenolysis,
  hepatic glucose production, and gluconeogenesis []. In the lung, metformin modulates
  the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α/NF-kB/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways
  and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the intestines, metformin modifies
  gut microbiome and promotes incretin (e.g., glucagon-like peptide 1, GLP-1) secretion
  with increased glucose utilization. In the nervous system, metformin reduces amyloid
  plaque formation and decline of cognitive function. In the circulatory systems,
  metformin improves dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction with reduced cardiovascular–renal
  events. Metformin reduces site-specific cancer events, including prostate and liver,
  in part due to amelioration of insulin resistance with reduced activation of insulin/insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF-1). Metformin is eliminated by the kidney. Metformin alleviates
  podocyte loss, mesangial cells apoptosis, and tubular cells senescence through AMPK-mediated
  signaling pathways. In chronic kidney disease, renal fibrosis is ameliorated by
  metformin, mainly via AMPK activation. Reduced glomerular filtration and tubular
  secretion may lead to accumulation of metformin and increased risk of lactic acidosis,
  especially in stress situations [] (adapted from reference []).
