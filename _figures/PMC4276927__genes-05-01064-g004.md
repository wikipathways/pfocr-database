caption: Three intracellular signaling pathways are shown schematically. (At left),
  receptor tyrosine kinase activity leads to activation of PIK3CA, AKT, and mechanistic
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) [,]. mTOR participates in complexes (TORC1, activated
  by RHEB; TORC2, inhibited by RHEB) that regulate cell growth, proliferation, survival,
  and cell cycle progression. This pathway includes genes that are frequently mutated
  in tumors such as PIK3CA and PTEN (not shown); (At center), secreted growth factors
  bind to receptor tyrosine kinase receptors on the cell surface leading to activation
  of the low molecular weight G protein Ras and subsequent activation of Raf, MEK
  1/2, and ERK 1/2 (official gene symbols MAPK3, MAPK1); (At right), a G-protein coupled
  receptor (GPCR) pathway is shown [,]. Ligands such as vasopressin, endothelin, glutamate,
  or norepinephrine bind to a GPCR. When bound by ligand, the receptor activates a
  G protein alpha subunit such as Gαq that binds and hydrolyzes GTP. This leads to
  activation of phospholipase Cβ producing inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and membrane-associated
  diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG, through activation of protein kinase C, may activate
  the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. IP3 may bind to an IP3 receptor activating calcium signaling
  pathways (not shown). Other G protein α subunits (such as Gαs encoded by GNAS) activate
  membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, producing cyclic AMP (cAMP) that activates protein
  kinase A (not shown).
