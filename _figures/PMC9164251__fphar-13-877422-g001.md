caption: 'Immune reaction in COVID-19: Innate immunity and the role of P53. 1) SARS-CoV-2
  infects the type II pneumocytes by binding its S protein with the angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor exposed on the surface of the pneumocyte membrane. 2) IFNα
  and IFNβ play an antiviral role inside the infected cells by inhibiting viral replication.
  3) On the neighbour cells, IFNα and IFNβ bind their receptors IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.
  4) The signal transduction results in activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway
  involved in IFN-dependent antiviral defence. 5) The phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 proteins
  form a heterotrimeric transcriptional factor with IRF9 known as the IFN-stimulated
  gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which translocates to the nucleus. 6) ISGF3 ties the IFN
  sequence response elements (ISREs) contained within the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)
  promoter, and it enhances the transcription of the downstream genes involved in
  IFN antiviral response (). 7) ISREs is included in the P53 gene promoter, and ISGF3
  was proved to induce the expression of P53, whose protein level increases during
  the antiviral immune response. 8) P53 protein actives IFN production and signalling
  modulating the pathway members, such as IRF9, with positive feedback in the early
  stages of infection. 9) In the later stage of infection, p53 could thwart the viral
  spread leading to apoptosis in infected cells (). 10) The level of p53 is controlled
  by E3 ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2), and the MDM2-p53 interaction decreases
  the p53 transcription factor and downregulates mdm-2 gene expression creating a
  negative feedback mechanism (). 11) Viral papain-like proteases (PLPs), a cysteine
  protease essential to process the viral proteins, suppresses the innate immunity
  by stabilizing the cellular oncoprotein MDM2 and inducing the degradation of p53.
  12) The therapeutic strategy consists of the administration of the extracellular
  vesicles loaded with small-molecule MDM2 inhibitors to block the protein-protein
  interaction between p53 and MDM2. Their ability to protect p53 from degradation
  makes the small molecules MDM2 inhibitors an attractive drug that, once loaded in
  the EVs, could be delivered to the targeted district, reducing the pro-inflammation
  state in the early stages of viral infection. The Figure was created with Biorender.com.'
