caption: Schematic representation of the most important approaches to melanoma treatment.
  (A) Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling is often deregulated in melanoma
  and, for this reason, several drugs against the components of the pathway have been
  developed. Although less frequently mutated, the v-kit Hardy–Zuckerman 4 feline
  sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) receptor tyrosine kinase, represents another
  molecular target for certain melanomas, and KIT inhibitors can be used in combination
  with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. (B) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein
  4 (CTLA-4), interacting with B7 ligands present on the surface of dendritic cells
  (DCs), prevents the activation of T lymphocytes. The functional block of CTLA-4
  mediated by monoclonal antibodies supports the interaction between B7 ligands and
  CD28, positive regulator receptor of the T lymphocyte activity. (C) Melanoma cells
  usually express elevated levels of programmed death ligand (PDL) 1 and 2, which,
  through interaction with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells,
  block their activation. Pharmacological inhibition of the PD-1 axis restores T cells’
  ability to recognize and kill tumor cells.
