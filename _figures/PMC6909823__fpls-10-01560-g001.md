caption: A proposed metabolic pathway connecting primary and specialized metabolism
  in intact A. thaliana Col-0 seedlings. In planta turnover of glucosinolates may
  proceed via hydrolytic cleavage of the glucose (Glc) moiety by a ß-glucosidase to
  form an aglucone, which is either metabolized to the corresponding nitrile in dependency
  of nitrile-specifier proteins (NSPs) or rearranged to the isothiocyanate. Nitriles
  can be further metabolized by nitrilases (NIT) to carboxylic acids, while isothiocyanates
  can be conjugated to glutathione (GSH) and metabolized to the corresponding amine
  and raphanusamic acid. Further downstream metabolization of those metabolites is
  not yet elucidated (dotted arrows).
