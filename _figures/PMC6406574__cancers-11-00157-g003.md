caption: MCSP- and ABCB5-enriched CTCs exhibit distinct transcriptional programming,
  with ABCB5 CTCs displaying an invasive phenotype. Schematic representation of cellular
  hallmarks enriched by the genes found to be differentially up-regulated in (A) MCSP-
  and (B) ABCB5-enriched CTCs. Enriched cellular hallmarks in CTCs are shown in green
  boxes, while genes shown in grey are those that were not found enriched in this
  study but are known to be important for melanomagenesis. Canonical pathway signalling
  is indicated by continuous arrows and dotted arrows indicates a previously reported
  interaction.
