caption: Pathway Studio Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins between
  control and U251 cells treated with ST1926. Proteins in blue color are up-regulated,
  while those in green color are down-regulated, and their relationships with (A)
  DNA replication, DNA repair, DNA damage, response to DNA damage, and oxidative stress;
  (B) cell proliferation, cell growth, cell cycle, and cell cycle arrest; and (C)
  cell survival, apoptosis, and cell death are indicated. The raw data with the p-values
  of the relationship and pathways indicated in each of the generated panels are provided
  as supplementary raw data.
