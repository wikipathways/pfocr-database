caption: 'Interaction maps of MAM proteins and associated eye pathologies and canonical
  DR-related signaling pathways. MAM proteins with notable associations with specific
  signaling pathways and eye pathology underlying DR were selected from the 179 altered
  MAM proteins in the Type 1 diabetic condition. (A) Eight crystallin proteins and
  VCAM1 were notably identified as having associations with MAF. VCAM1 and several
  specific crystallin proteins (CRYAB, CRYAA/CRYAA2) were found to have numerous ties
  to the onset of various eye pathologies. (B) LGALS3 is a key MAM protein that is
  associated with processes of retinal degeneration via multiple specific protein-protein
  interactions. The functional networks were generated through IPA. Figure legend
  displays molecules and function symbol types and colors. Lighter shades of red,
  green, and blue represent decreased intensities of up-regulation, down-regulation,
  and inhibition, respectively. MAM: Mitochondria-associated ER membrane, IPA: Ingenuity
