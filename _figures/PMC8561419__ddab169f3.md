caption: Principal component analysis (PCA) biplots visualizing placental tryptophan
  pathway gene expression in preterm delivery placentas. (A) Positions of individual
  and subgroups of placentas in the first, second and third dimensions (accounting
  for 37.2, 20.5 and 10.9% of explained variance, respectively) in biplots [MIAC (colonization),
  MIAC and IAI (intra-amniotic infection), IAI (sterile IAI), and none (neither MIAC
  nor IAI)] and vectors of expression of indicated genes (black arrows). (B) Positions
  of placentas associated with indicated HCA grades [fetal (fetal inflammatory response),
  maternal (maternal inflammatory response) or none (absence of HCA)] in the first,
  second and third dimensions (accounting for 40.7, 17.2 and 11.1% of explained variance,
  respectively) in biplots and vectors of expression of indicated genes variables
  (black arrows). A 95% confidence ellipse was drawn around the barycenter for each
  group. The gene expression data were log2 transformed prior to analysis.
