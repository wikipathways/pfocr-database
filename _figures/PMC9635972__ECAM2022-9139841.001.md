caption: A schematic plot of DA transport in the extracellular and intracellular pathways.
  ① DA is released to the synaptic cleft by vesicular exocytosis, acting on DA receptors
  on the postsynaptic membrane. DA is then reuptaken by dopamine transporters (DAT)
  back into neurons, partly reabsorbed, and utilized and partly inactivated by inactivating
  enzymes (MAO). ② DA in the synaptic cleft acts on D1-like and D2-like receptors,
  which exert different physiological functions. The Dl-like receptors are coupled
  to Gs/olf proteins that activate the cAMP/PKA pathway, whereas the D2-like receptors
  are coupled to Gi/o proteins that inhibit AC activity and eventually lead to reduced
  PKA levels; similar effects are observed on the Ca2+/CAM/CAMKII pathway.
