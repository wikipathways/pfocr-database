caption: The cAMP chemotactic signaling pathway in D. discoideum cells. Upon cAMP
  binding, the cAR1 receptor triggers heterotrimeric G protein-independent and -dependent
  pathways. The G protein-independent pathway involves Erk2 activation, cAR1 phosphorylation,
  and calcium (Ca2+) influx. The G protein-dependent pathway involves the activation
  or dissociation of G proteins catalyzed by the GEF activity of cAR1. The activation
  of G proteins is shown by the light blue box. This is followed by the activation
  of several signaling molecules, finally leading to chemotaxis. It is still unknown
  how G protein activity is transmitted to some signaling molecules, including RasG,
  RasC, Pla2, and cGMP. G proteins are comprised of Gα2 and Gγ subunits, which are
  myristoylated (Myr) and geranylgeranylated (GG), respectively, for their plasma
  membrane localization. They undergo complex formation with Gip1 in the cytoplasm,
  which allows for the spatial regulation of G proteins. The dashed lines represent
  several or unknown steps.
