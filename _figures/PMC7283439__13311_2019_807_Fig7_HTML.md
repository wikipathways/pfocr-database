caption: Schematic model of FG-4592 activity on depression. Schematic representation
  of molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of FG-4592 on depression
  and memory impairment by activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling
  after inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase enzyme activity. Brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) expression increased when
  the HIF signaling pathway was activated, eventually leading to increased hippocampal
  neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity that elicit exerts antidepressant effects
