caption: The binding of nicotine and NNK, a tobacco carcinogen derived from nictine
  to α7-nAChR might induce the formation of an oligomeric complex, including Src,
  β-arrestin, and α7-nAChR. This can lead to the elevation of cytosolic calcium influx
  and activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, thereby promoting lung cancer proliferation.
  Nicotine also phosphorylates VEGFR2, which in turn increases COX and induces MMPs,
  which can cause cancer cell invasion. Nicotine can activate NF-κB by activation
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which may increase inflammation, survival, and proliferation.
  β-Cryptoxanthin inhibits lung cancer progression and metastasis by inhibiting α7-nAChR
  in mice. α7-nAChR, α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; BCO1, β-carotene 15,15’-dioxygenase;
  BCO2, β-carotene 9’,10’-oxygenase; COX2, cyclooxygenase2; MMP, matrix metallopeptidase;
  VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor
  receptor.
