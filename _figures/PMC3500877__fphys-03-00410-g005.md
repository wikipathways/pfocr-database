caption: Topology of GR/Erg models in CEM C1–15 cells. Schematic representation of
  GR/Erg pathway in CEM-C1–15 cells. The nature of the topologies was based on previously
  established direct and indirect GR target models in CEM-C1–15 cells (Chen et al.,
  ). GR autoregulation was not included in CEM-C1–15, Model 5 and Model 6 differ by
  the GR regulation on Erg induction, with Model 5 indicating Erg as a direct GR target
  (A) and Model 6 showing Erg as an indirect GR target where de novo protein synthesis
  is required for Erg induction (B).
