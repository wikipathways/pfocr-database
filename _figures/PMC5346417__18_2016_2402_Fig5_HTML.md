caption: Diagram showing the hypothetical model for regulation of NCC phosphorylation
  in the DCT cell, and hence the level of transcellular NaCl flux. Activity in the
  WNK/SPAK/NCC pathway is directly regulated through the extracellular [K+], causing
  parallel changes to intracellular [Cl−] and WNK4 kinase activity
