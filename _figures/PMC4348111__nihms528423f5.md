caption: In HLH, dysregulation of the inflammatory response results in hypercytokinemia
  which in turn promotes upregulation of serum S-SMase. S-SMase is well positioned
  to act on serum SM (primarily bound to lipoproteins) driving production of select
  Cer species. Upon action of a downstream CDase, S-SMase-derived Cer can be deacylated
  to form Sph. Key changes in the serum SPL profile in patients with HLH, include
  elevations in total Cer and Sph, as well as decreased levels of S1P. C16-Cer levels
  exhibited the most significant increase in HLH. As described in Figure 7, the ratio
  of C16-Cer:Sph correlates very strongly with survival – HLH patients that died had
  higher serum levels of C16-Cer relative to Sph, whereas the ratio of C16-Cer:Sph
  was significantly lower HLH patients that survived.
