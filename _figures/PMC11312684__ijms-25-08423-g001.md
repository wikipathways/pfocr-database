caption: 'GSH synthesis and transport of precursor amino acids: (a) γ-Glutamyl cycle
  of GSH synthesis. γ-Glutamyl transferase (GGT) is localized on the outer side of
  the cytoplasmic membrane and facilitates the transfer of the γ-glutamyl residue
  to the neutral amino acid, enabling its transport into the cell. The dipeptide cysteinylglycine,
  formed as a result of GGT’s action, is cleaved by dipeptidase into cysteine and
  glycine, which become the substrates for γ-glutamylcysteine ligase (γGCL) and glutathione
  synthetase (GS). γ-Glutamylcyclotransferase breaks the bond between the γ-glutamyl
  residue and the amino acid with the formation of a free amino acid and 5-oxoproline,
  which is decyclized by oxoprolinase with the formation of glutamic acid, the substrate
  for γGCL. Cysteine and glutamate synthesize γ-glutamylcysteine (GGC) via γGCL, and
  glycine is added to its C-terminus by GS to form GSH. (b) Transport of GSH precursor
  amino acids. Cysteine is a rate-limiting precursor of GSH synthesis and is mainly
  obtained through cystine uptake via a cystine/glutamate exchange transporter, system
  xc- (SLC7A11), which is overexpressed in many human cancers. Cysteine also may be
  generated partially de novo via the transsulfuration pathway or carried by other
  non-specific amino acid transporters, including SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 (alanine–serine–cysteine
  transporters, ASCT1/2), and the excitatory amino acid transporter SLC1A1 (EAAT3),
  which simultaneously acts as a high-affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate carrier.
  Glutamine enters the cells through several amino acid transporters, including SLC1A5
  (ASCT2), which is highly overexpressed in cancer cells. Glutaminase (GSL) produces
  glutamate from glutamine. GSH, as a cosubstrate of key GSH-related enzymes (GPxs
  and GSTs), takes part in the detoxification of organic (POOH) or lipid (PEOOH) hydroperoxides
  into corresponding alcohols and electrophiles into GSH conjugates. GR catalyzes
  the NADPH-driven reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH'
