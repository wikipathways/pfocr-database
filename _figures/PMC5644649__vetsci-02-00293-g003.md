caption: 'Signaling model of Nef-mediated (A) apoptosis/anti-apoptosis, (B) down-regulation
  of expression of MHC class I molecules, and (C) down-regulation of the expression
  of CD4 molecules. A. Internalization of MHC-I: Nef accelerates the endocytosis of
  MHC class I molecules through PI3K-dependent activation of ADP ribosylation factor
  6 (ARF6)-mediated endocytosis. First, the Nef binds PACS-2 and targets to the late
  Golgi/TGN; at the TGN, Nef binds and activates a TGN-localized SFK. The activated
  Nef–SFK complex, which leads to the signal transduction pathway recruiting and activating
  ZAP-70/Syk, then binds to a class I PI3K. The activated PI3K causes the accumulation
  of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdInsP3) (PIP3) on the inner leaflet
  of the plasma membrane. PIP3 recruits the ARF6 guanosine exchange factor (ARF6-GEF)
  to the plasma membrane. Nef mediates the internalization of MHC-I from the plasma
  membrane to an ARF-6 endosomal compartment. The endocytosed MHC-I forms a complex
  with Nef and AP-1 via phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS1). B.
  Internalization of CD4: Lck disassociates from the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 and Nef
  is attached to the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 within clathrin-coated pits through the
  interaction of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase). This leads
  to the internalization of CD4 into the early endosome. During the formation of the
  late endosome, Nef intacts with βCOP1 and through ARF-1, which targets CD4 to the
  lysosomal degradation. C. Apoptotic role of Nef: Intrinsic Nef signals localized
  on plasma membrane activate MAP kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) to induce caspase-dependent apoptosis, while the anti-apoptotic pathway is
  mediated by Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS) and tumor-necrosis factor receptor
  (TNFR) by inhibiting the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) and P53. Nef-mediated
  p21-activated kinase (PAK) activation involves PI3K, which acts upstream of PAK.
  Nef-associated PI3K and PAK phosphorylate the pro-apoptotic Bad protein to inactivate
  Bad, thus blocking the apoptosis mediated by BCL-2.'
