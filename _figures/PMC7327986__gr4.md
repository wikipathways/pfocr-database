caption: The generation of quinones and the activation of redox signaling pathway.
  (A) Polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as phenanthrene undergoes photo-oxidation in
  the environment or metabolic activation by enzymes, yielding its quinone. (B) 9,10-Phenanthraquinone
  (9,10-PQ) is reduced by enzymes such as NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase (NQO1) or
  aldo-keto reductase (AKR) to 9,10-dihydroxyphenanthrene (9,10-PQH2), which is conjugated
  with glucuronic acid by glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) and then excreted viamultidrug-associated
  proteins (MRP). 9,10-PQH2 is also able to react with superoxide (O2•–) to form its
  semiquinone radical (9,10-PQ•–) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Alternatively, 9,10-PQ•–
  is generated by disproportionation reaction of 9,10-PQ with 9,10-PQH2. The 9,10-PQ•–
  produced interacts with molecular oxygen (O2) to form 9,10-PQ and O2•–. Thus, H2O2
  during these redox cycle reactions of 9,10-PQ could activate redox signaling pathways
  mimicking endogenous H2O2.
