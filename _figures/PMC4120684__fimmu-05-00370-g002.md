caption: Comparison between recombinant Shh- and EVsShh+-activated pathways modulating
  angiogenesis and apoptosis in endothelial cells. (A) Recombinant Shh protein was
  shown to promote migration and capillary formation through SMO-Gi coupled and PI3K
  activation, triggering ROCK pathway activation, and downstream targets (MMP-9 and
  osteopontin). Such activation illustrates the importance of non-canonical pathways
  in Shh-induced angiogenesis processes. Despite Shh induction of Gli nuclear translocation
  in endothelial cells, role of canonical signaling on vascular function remains elusive.
  Finally, activation of Hh signaling counteracts non-canonical PTC-induced caspase-3
  cleavage and protects endothelial cells against apoptosis. (B) EVsShh+ were demonstrated
  to use similar pathways than those described for recombinant Shh protein. They additionally
  induce functional and mature blood vessel formation by enhancing mRNA expression
  of several pro-angiogenic factors, especially VEGF and decreasing mRNA of anti-angiogenic
  TGFβ. EVsShh+ also exert vasculoprotective effects by inducing anti-oxidants defenses,
  particularly through direct transfer of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase) concurring
  to decrease ROS intracellular levels. SMO, smoothened; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase;
  ROCK, Rho-associated protein kinase; MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; Hh, Hedgehog;
  PTC, Patched; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; TGFβ, transforming growth
  factor β; SOD, superoxide dismutase; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
