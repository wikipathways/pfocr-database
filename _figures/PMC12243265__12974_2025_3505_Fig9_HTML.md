caption: RGCs damage in glaucoma were ameliorated via Gut microbiota-IAA-eye signaling
  pathway. Dysbiosis of tryptophan metabolism-related microbiota B. fragili leads
  to low level of its metabolite IAA in glaucoma. By in vivo and in vitro experiment
  we demonstrated supplement of B.fragilis or IAA could activate AhR and inhibit RAGE/NFκB
  to suppress retinal neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, and ultimately relieved
  the progression of RGCs loss
