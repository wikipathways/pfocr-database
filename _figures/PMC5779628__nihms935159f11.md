caption: Model for excitation–transcription coupling responsible for maladaptive metabolic
  and antioxidant remodeling in HF. Deficits in β-adrenergic signaling and Ca2+ handling
  are hallmarks of HF that are recapitulated in the guinea pig model. These deficits
  are expected to diminish the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent
  kinases. Pathway analysis suggests an analogy to neuronal signaling, in which PKA
  and CAMK activity have been shown to govern the phosphorylation state and activation
  status of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) binding protein (CREB), a transcriptional
  coactivator. Since CREB is a documented transcriptional coactivator of PGC1α (itself
  a coactivator) and other genes (e.g., RYR2, BDNF), impaired CREB activation by CaMK/PKA
  would impinge on PGC1α-dependent gene programs, among them PPAR/RXR-mediated activation
  of genes for fatty acid metabolism (e.g., CPT1B, β-oxidation enzymes). PGC1α also
  participates in NRF 1- and 2-mediated activation of genes responsible for mitochondrial
  homeostasis (e.g., TFAM) and antioxidant function (e.g., SOD2 and PRDX3). Finally,
  antioxidant defenses suffer a double blow. Not only are antioxidant proteins downregulated,
  but also, acute Ca2+/Na2+ dysregulation abrogates mitochondrial TCA-cycle-dependent
  NADPH production, which is required to sustain the activity of thiol-bearing antioxidant
  enzymes.
