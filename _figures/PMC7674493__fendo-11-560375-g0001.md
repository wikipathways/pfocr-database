caption: Putative mechanistic model of insulin resistance via c-Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) activation. This simplified putative model describes JNK activation pathway
  as a phosphorylation target of a variety of extracellular stimuli, e.g., proinflammatory
  cytokines as well as intracellular stimuli, oxidative stress, and oxidized mtDNA.
  Upon activation, phosphorylated JNK promotes direct serine phosphorylation of insulin
  receptor substrate protein IRS1, thus causing a defective IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation
  and reduced phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and AKT signaling in response
  to insulin receptor activation. Phosphorylation of serine residues inhibits the
  interaction of IRS1 with the insulin receptor, thereby blocking the response to
  insulin. Being applicable this model for neuronal IR would lead to disastrous consequences
  for most of the cellular stirpes within the brain. JNK activation by ROS-free radicals,
  Aβ, and hyperphosphorylated Tau promotes the transcriptional expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines, which in turn may enhance the production of ROS, the mitochondrial dysfunction,
  and the accumulation of neurotoxic Aβ+p-Tau, which ultimately enhance IR. Similarly,
  RAGE activates the transcription of proinflammatory products. A putative vicious
  circle would presuppose that ROS spillover within the mitochondrial environment
  amplifies inflammation, impairs, and damages OXPHOS enzymes and provoke mtDNA damages/mutations.
  These events ultimately synergize and amplify IR and neuronal energetic collapse,
  leading to the organelle fragmentation. Accordingly, the pool of dysfunctional and
  fragmented mitochondria will induce neuronal demise.
