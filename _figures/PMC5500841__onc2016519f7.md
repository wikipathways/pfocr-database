caption: Model of oncogenic Kit signaling on intracellular compartments in GISTs and
  mast cell tumors. (Left, GISTs) Newly synthesized Kit(mut) traffics normally from
  the ER to the Golgi, then undergoes complex glycosylation as normal. After reacting
  the Golgi, Kit(mut) can activate the PI3K–Akt pathway, STAT5 and Erk. SFKs on the
  Golgi are needed for oncogenic Kit signaling. Activation of Kit in the wrong subcellular
  compartment, then prevents its export from Golgi to the PM. These mechanisms are
  common between imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant Kit cases. (Right, mast
  cell tumors) Soon after synthesis, immature Kit is localized on the ER and activates
  STAT5. It then traffics to the PM along the secretory pathway. After Kit(mut) reaches
  the PM, it immediately moves to endolysosomes through endocytosis in a kinase activity-dependent
  manner. Kit–PI3K activates Akt specifically on endolysosomes.
