caption: Proposed working model of PWR function in dehydration response. PWR together
  with HDA9 and ABI4 positively regulate ABA response either by acting at ABA receptors
  or by repressing negative regulators of the ABA pathway, which results in downstream
  expression of ABA-responsive genes. In the absence of dehydration stress, CYP707A1
  is expressed and regulates ABA hydroxylation, but dehydration stress triggers PWR-HDA9-ABI4-mediated
  repression of CYP707A1 expression through the process of deacetylation and activates
  drought response.
