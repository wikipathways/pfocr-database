caption: Activation of NF-κB signaling pathway increases the expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes to aggravate the inflammation of UC. IKK activation can phosphorylate NF-κB
  inhibitors, leading to their proteasomal degradation. This process activates and
  releases NF-κB complexes into the nucleus, triggering the expression of target genes
  involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, and initiating downstream signaling
  pathways. Increased expression of NF-κB P-p65 is associated with elevated secretion
  of proinflammatory cytokines and other factors, exacerbating intestinal mucosal
  inflammation in UC. ‘Adapted from “FullTemplateName”, by BioRender.com (CurrentYear).
