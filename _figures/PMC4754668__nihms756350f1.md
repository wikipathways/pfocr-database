caption: Overview of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells type 1 (TREM-1)
  signaling pathway. Engagement of TREM-1 by its unidentified ligand leads to its
  association with DNAX activation protein-12 (DAP-12) in the transmembrane region
  of the cell. This association causes a salt bride formation between a positively
  charged lysine and negatively charged aspartic acid that leads to the formation
  of an immunoreceptor-tyrosine–based activation motif (ITAM) on the cytoplasmic domain.
  The tyrosine residues in the DAP12 ITAM then undergo Src kinase–induced phosphorylation,
  which forms a docking site for tyrosine kinase Syk. Syk phosphorylation activates
  a signaling cascade, which leads to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines.
