caption: Bile acid synthesis pathways. The classic pathway for bile acid synthesis
  occurs in the hepatocytes of the liver via 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) converting cholesterol
  into 7α-hydroxycholesterol. Primary bile acid cholic acid (CA) is formed after subsequent
  conversions from sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) and chenodeoxycholic acid from
  sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). In the alternative or acidic pathway, mitochondrial
  CYP27A1 in peripheral tissues convert cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol. Oxysterol
  7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) is an additional assisting enzyme in this pathway and the
  resulting products feed back into the liver, indicated by the red arrow feeding
  into the classical pathway under CYP27A1. Primary and secondary bile acids specific
  to rodents are listed in purple. Bile acids can become conjugated with glycine or
  taurine after interactions with gut flora.
