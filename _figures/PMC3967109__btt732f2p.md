caption: 'Target gene set within Alzheimer’s disease environmental network. Grey nodes
  represent the input set, green the pathway and blue the overlap between them. Orange
  nodes represent the expansion. Interactions between the input set and added nodes
  are highlighted: edges to pathway nodes are green and edges to expansion nodes are
  orange'
