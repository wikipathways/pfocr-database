caption: Uptake and metabolism model of α-(1,6)-galactoside/glucoside by B. animalis
  subsp. lactis and the other bifidobacteria possessing a similar system (see ). BlG16BP
  (Balac_1599), which is anchored to the extracellular side of the cell membrane by
  a lipid anchor, captures α-(1,6)-galacto-oligosaccharides (RFO) and α-(1,6)-gluco-oligosaccharides
  (IMO), which are translocated to the cytoplasm by the ABC transport system (Balac_1598,
  Balac_1597, and Balac_1610). The α-galactosidase (Balac_1601) and the α-(1,6)-glucosidase
  are responsible for the degradation of α-(1,6)-galactosides and α-(1,6)-glucosides,
  respectively, based on transcriptional data () and homology to characterized counterparts.
  α-(1,4)-Glucosidases and sucrose phosphorylases are possible candidates for the
  degradation of the maltose moiety of panose and the sucrose moiety of raffinose,
  respectively, into glucose and galactose, which is converted into glucose 1-phosphate
  via the Lelior pathway before entering the bifid shunt. Leloir refers to the Leloir
  pathway a metabolic pathway for catabolism of galactose.
