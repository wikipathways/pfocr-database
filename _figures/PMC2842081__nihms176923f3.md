caption: When telomeres lose protection, either due to extensive loss of TTAGGG repeats
  or due to loss of protective factors such as TRF2 and POT1, they are recognized
  as damage in a pathway that depends on the MRN complex and the AT kinase. Next the
  G overhang is lost, then the chromatin structure changes and 53BP1 is recruited
  to allow for greater mobility, which facilitates NHEJ dependent covalent fusion
  of chromosome ends. In the absence of the p53 and pRb dependent tumor suppressor
  pathways cells containing nuclei with fused chromosome ends continue to cycle. When
  the fused chromosomes pass through mitosis they break randomly, leading to unequal
  distribution of genetic material in the daughter cells. These fusion-breakage-bridge
  cycles continue through the following cell divisions, leading to multiple non-reciprocal
  translocations and genome instability.
