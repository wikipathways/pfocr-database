caption: A working model of PKA’s role in trastuzumab resistance. The canonical mechanism
  of PKA activation is through cAMP-mediated release of regulatory subunits from the
  catalytic PKAc subunit of the enzyme. Release of the RIIα subunit by cAMP (red circles)
  is illustrated at the left of the figure. The green arrow indicates the down-regulation
  of PKA-RIIα in trastuzumab-resistant cell lines, also postulated to activate PKAc.
  The righthand portion of the figure illustrates stimulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
  by Her2/Her3 heterodimers, the predominant receptor tyrosine kinase pathway in BT474
  cells, and blockage (red X) of the Her2 component of that pathway by trastuzumab.
  Dashed lines and question marks indicate hypothetical pathways that might be impacted
  by activated PKA in BT/HerR cells to mediate sustained PI3K/Akt signaling and trastuzumab
  resistance. These include direct activation of EGFR or PI3K and indirect activation
  of pAkt by inhibition of PP-1 (see text). The activation of PI3K/Akt via EGFR (either
  as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with Her3) upon trastuzumab-mediated inhibition
  of Her2 is also hypothetical, but consistent with our earlier studies of BT/HerR
  cells ().
