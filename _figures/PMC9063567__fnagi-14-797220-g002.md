caption: Regulation of Cholesterol metabolism pathways. Cholesterol is synthesized
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from Acetyl-CoA through several steps using different
  enzymes, including the rate limiting enzyme HMGCOA-reductase (HMGCR). SREBP2 forms
  a complex with SCAP, a sensor of cholesterol, which is anchored at the ER membrane.
  When cholesterol is high, the sensor SCAP interact to INSIG protein, maintaining
  the SREBP2/SCAP complex at the ER membrane. When cholesterol level is low, SREBP2/SCAP
  complex can translocate to the Golgi where SREBP2 is activated by a cleavage. The
  activated SREBP2 can then translocate to the nucleus to induce the transcription
  of genes coding cholesterol synthesis enzymes, such as HMGCOA-reductase (HmcR),
  HMGCO-synthase (HmgcS), Squalen Synthas (SqSyn), Cyp51, Dhcr. This is associated
  to a negative feedback loop on cholesterol synthesis pathway. Sterol accumulation
  in the ER membrane triggers proteasome-mediated degradation of HMGCR through INSIG/GRP78-mediated
  mechanism. In parallel, the enzyme CYP46A1 can catalyze the cholesterol into 24S-OHC,
  a ligand of the nuclear receptor LXR. When the 24S-OHC binds to LXR, a co-activator
  is recruited and induce the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol efflux
  (Abca1, ApoE), leading to a decrease of intracellular cholesterol level. Yellow
  lightning points out altered functions in cholesterol metabolism in HD. Created
