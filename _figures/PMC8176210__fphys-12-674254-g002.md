caption: Obesity and associated metabolic traits drive myocardial dysfunction and
  remodeling in obesity-HFPEF phenotype. Obesity and associated metabolic traits induce
  a systemic proinflammatory state characterized by high plasma levels of interleukin
  6 (IL-6), soluble ST2 (sST2), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and pentraxin 3.
  Coronary microvascular endothelial cells produce vascular cell adhesion molecule
  (VCAM), E-selectin, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The production of ROS results
  in reduced NO bioavailability and peroxynitrite (ONOO–) production, both of which
  may lower soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activity in adjacent cardiomyocytes. Lower
  sGC activity results in decreased cGMP concentration and reduced protein kinase
  G (PKG) activity. Low PKG activity may trigger a cascade of events leading to cardiomyocyte
  hypertrophy. E-selectin and VCAM expression in endothelial cells may favor migration
  into the subendothelium of immune cells, which may release cytokines and growth
  factors including the fibroblast growth factors (FGF-1 and FGF-2) and platelet-derived
  growth factor (PDGF). FGF-1, FGF-2, and PDGF activate the membrane tyrosine kinase
  receptors, which then trigger a full range of intracellular Ras-Raf–mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal–regulated kinase-MAPK signaling transduction
  pathways, leading to a down-regulation of NPR-C gene expression. Low NPR-C activity
  may remove the brake on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, thereby inducing cardiac fibrosis
  and remodeling, leading to diastolic dysfunction, the major cardiac functional deficit
  in HFPEF.
