caption: The role of signaling pathways in self-renewal and differentiation of in
  vitro pluripotent stem cell populations. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent a
  naïve state of pluripotency similar to the pre-implantation epiblast (Epi). ESCs
  are routinely maintained in a self-renewing state in serum (a source of BMP) and
  LIF (SL). Under these conditions, ESC cultures are heterogeneous and contain subpopulations
  of lineage-primed cells (yellow and green cells) i.e. cells that coexpress germ
  layer markers alongside pluripotency markers, and are biased in differentiation
  towards particular lineages. A more homogeneous ESC state can be generated by blocking
  FGF signaling using a MEK inhibitor (PD0325901), and activating Wnt signaling using
  a GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), a condition known as ‘2i’. In these conditions, self-renewal
  occurs in the absence of external signals, although cell propagation is enhanced
  in the presence of Wnt pathway activity through CHIR99021. This state is referred
  to as the naïve or “ground state” of pluripotency. ESCs can be pushed further along
  the differentiation trajectory by culturing in the presence of FGF and Activin (FA)
  for 48 hours to generate a cell state referred to as Epi-like cells (EpiLCs). This
  is a transient cell state, and it is unknown whether self-renewing EpiLCs can be
  captured by the addition of other factors. It is also not known whether EpiLCs are
  a homogeneous population of cells. Upon further differentiation in FA over multiple
  passages, cells resemble a primed state of pluripotency akin to the later post-implantation
  Epi, referred to as epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). While FA promotes differentiation
  of ESCs and EpiLCs, it promotes EpiSC self-renewal. EpiSCs can be derived from ESCs
  in culture or directly from embryos with FA. When grown in FA, EpiSCs, like ESCs
  in SL, are heterogeneous and contain lineage-primed populations. While activation
  of Wnt signaling promotes a naïve ground state of self-renewal, inhibition of Wnt
  signaling promotes a more homogeneous primed ground state of self-renewal. Therefore
  cells in naïve and primed pluripotent states respond to signaling factors with opposite
  outcomes, Wnt and BMP promote self-renewal of the naïve state but differentiation
  of the primed state of pluripotency and conversely FA promote differentiation of
  the naïve state but self-renewal of the primed state of pluripotency. Addition of
  BMP4 and WNT3A in combination with FA stimulates further differentiation of EpiSCs
  into PS-derived mesoderm and endoderm, while in the absence of FA, BMP or Wnt EpiSCs
  differentiate to neurectoderm []. EpiLCs are the only pluripotent state that has
  been shown to efficiently generate primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs). Presumably,
  ESCs have not yet acquired this capacity, while EpiSCs have lost it. Cells within
  the dashed box are within the pluripotency spectrum while cells outside have differentiated.
  Blue arrows indicate self-renewal. Orange arrows denote the direction of differentiation
  along the developmental trajectory

  description: The role of signaling pathways in self-renewal and differentiation
    of in vitro pluripotent stem cell populations. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) represent
    a naïve state of pluripotency similar to the pre-implantation epiblast (Epi).
    ESCs are routinely maintained in a self-renewing state in serum (a source of BMP)
    and LIF (SL). Under these conditions, ESC cultures are heterogeneous and contain
    subpopulations of lineage-primed cells (yellow and green cells) i.e. cells that
    coexpress germ layer markers alongside pluripotency markers, and are biased in
    differentiation towards particular lineages. A more homogeneous ESC state can
    be generated by blocking FGF signaling using a MEK inhibitor (PD0325901), and
    activating Wnt signaling using a GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), a condition known
    as ‘2i’. In these conditions, self-renewal occurs in the absence of external signals,
    although cell propagation is enhanced in the presence of Wnt pathway activity
    through CHIR99021. This state is referred to as the naïve or “ground state” of
    pluripotency. ESCs can be pushed further along the differentiation trajectory
    by culturing in the presence of FGF and Activin (FA) for 48 hours to generate
    a cell state referred to as Epi-like cells (EpiLCs). This is a transient cell
    state, and it is unknown whether self-renewing EpiLCs can be captured by the addition
    of other factors. It is also not known whether EpiLCs are a homogeneous population
    of cells. Upon further differentiation in FA over multiple passages, cells resemble
    a primed state of pluripotency akin to the later post-implantation Epi, referred
    to as epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). While FA promotes differentiation of ESCs
    and EpiLCs, it promotes EpiSC self-renewal. EpiSCs can be derived from ESCs in
    culture or directly from embryos with FA. When grown in FA, EpiSCs, like ESCs
    in SL, are heterogeneous and contain lineage-primed populations. While activation
    of Wnt signaling promotes a naïve ground state of self-renewal, inhibition of
    Wnt signaling promotes a more homogeneous primed ground state of self-renewal.
    Therefore cells in naïve and primed pluripotent states respond to signaling factors
    with opposite outcomes, Wnt and BMP promote self-renewal of the naïve state but
    differentiation of the primed state of pluripotency and conversely FA promote
    differentiation of the naïve state but self-renewal of the primed state of pluripotency.
    Addition of BMP4 and WNT3A in combination with FA stimulates further differentiation
    of EpiSCs into PS-derived mesoderm and endoderm, while in the absence of FA, BMP
    or Wnt EpiSCs differentiate to neurectoderm []. EpiLCs are the only pluripotent
    state that has been shown to efficiently generate primordial germ cell-like cells
    (PGCLCs). Presumably, ESCs have not yet acquired this capacity, while EpiSCs have
    lost it. Cells within the dashed box are within the pluripotency spectrum while
    cells outside have differentiated. Blue arrows indicate self-renewal. Orange arrows
    denote the direction of differentiation along the developmental trajectory
