caption: Metabolic reprogramming of prematurely aged T cells in rheumatoid arthritis
  (RA). Glucose imported into the cell can either be broken down to generate ATP or
  be shunted into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate reductive elements
  (NADPH). In RA T cells high activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
  and low activity of phosphofructokinase (PFK) result in excessive shunting of glucose,
  leaving the cell under reductive stress and impairing redox signaling. As a consequence,
  such cells insufficiently activate the cell cycle regulator ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM), which results in bypassing of the G2/M phase, hyperproliferation,
  and a bias toward proinflammatory effector functions. ROS = reactive oxygen species.
