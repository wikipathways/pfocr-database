caption: Cardioprotective effects of NO, H2S, and HNO. There are multiple underlying
  mechanisms for cardioprotective effect of H2S. It has been demonstrated to induce
  KATP channel opening, abolish inflammation and oxidative stress by inhibiting ROS
  production, block LTCC and intracellular cAMP signaling pathway, and inhibit Na+/H+
  exchanger activity. Furthermore, NO also plays an important role in the cardioprotective
  effect of H2S. Endogenous NO generated from eNOS in endothelial cells initiates
  the sGC-cGMP-PKG cascade to increase openings of subcellular (mitochondrial) KATP
  channels. The resultant inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)
  is responsible for decreased cytochrome C release and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.
  HNO, depending on the concentration, can be either cardioprotective or cardiotoxic.
  At low concentration, just like NO, HNO also stimulates KATP channels opening in
  mitochondria.
