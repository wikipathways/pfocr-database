caption: Figure 4. Gsk3β exists in different regulatory networks in pluripotent stem
  cells. Our findings suggest that in mPSCs, Gsk3β activity is primarily linked to
  the canonical PI3K pathway and targets substrates such a Nanog and c-myc. In hPSCs,
  Gsk3β forms complexes with Erk and is directed toward the canonical Wnt pathway
  and members of the “β-catenin destruction complex.” These data suggest that Gsk3β
  is recruited into additional signaling pathways as naïve cells transition to primed
  PSCs.
