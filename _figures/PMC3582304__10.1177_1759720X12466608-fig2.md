caption: Potential therapeutic targets of the Wnt signaling pathway. In the presence
  of sclerostin or dickkopf (Dkk) proteins, the ligands cannot bind their receptors
  to activate the Wnt signaling. The inhibitory effects of sclerostin and Dkk proteins
  can be neutralized by their respective antibodies, thus activating the Wnt signaling
  pathway downstream. Secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) and Wif inhibit the
  Wnt signaling by binding the Wnt ligands, but SFRP inhibitors such as diphenylsulfonyl
  sulfonamide can inhibit SFRPs from binding the Wnt ligands. Glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK3β) normally targets β catenin for degradation by phosphorylation. However,
  lithium or other pharmacological GSK3β-inhibiting compounds can inhibit the GSK3β
  activity, thus allowing β catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm and the nucleus
  expressing the target genes. Chibby (Cby) is an endogenous antagonist, which interrupts
  the binding of β catenin to transcriptional factors T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor (Lef-1).
