caption: Protein S-nitrosylation and energy metabolism in the brain. In adult brains,
  high glycolytic activity in astrocytes produces lactate, which is transported to
  neurons through the ANLS system. Lactate taken up into neurons is converted to pyruvate
  for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS). To facilitate TCA cycle activity,
  neurons can also leverage the PPP to produce pyruvate. Additionally, during intense
  neuronal stimulation or under conditions of nutrient depletion, neurons may utilize
  glycolysis or fatty acid (ketone body) metabolism for the production of pyruvate/acetyl-CoA.
  Glutamate metabolism also helps maintain the TCA cycle in neurons via production
  of α-ketoglutarate. NADH generated from the TCA cycle is further utilized in the
  ETC to produce ATP. S-nitrosylation (SNO) of key enzymes in glycolysis, fatty acid
  metabolism, glutamate metabolism, the TCA cycle, and the ETC affects all these processes.
