caption: 'Role of P2X7 receptor in the functional activity of neurons. Toxic function:
  P2X7 triggers an intracellular signaling pathway for the activation of free radical
  oxidation processes and the accumulation of ROS, as a result, mitochondria are actively
  involved in the process of ROS production. ROS via AMPK signaling pathway can trigger
  mitophagy, thereby controlling the presence of defective mitochondria in the neuron
  removing them and ensuring cell viability. However, with excessive accumulation
  of ROS and a decrease in the activity of the antioxidant systems of the cell, the
  correct functioning of the PARKIN protein is blocked, which leads to inhibition
  of the mitophagy process. Misfolding of proteins, defective mitochondria accumulate
  in the cell. One of the defective proteins is α-synuclein that in turn has binding
  sites for the P2X7 receptor stimulating it and thereby increasing the Ca2+ concentration
  in the cell. An elevated level of Ca2+ blocks AMPK activity, after which the death
  of neurons can follow the path of necrosis. Cytoprotective function: P2X7 triggers
  mitophagy throught the Ca2+ increases which activation AMPK signaling pathway. It
  eliminates defective mitochondria thereby contributing to the survival of neuroglia
  and maintaining its viability in conditions of short-term stimulation. P2X7, localized
  on the outer mitochondrial membrane, captures the concentration of ATP in the cell
  and, with a decrease in its production, enhances the work of Complex I (NADH-DH)
  of the electron transport chain, as a result of which oxidative phosphorylation
  is stimulated and ATP production in the cell increases. Figure Contributions: Alexei
  V. Deykin described the cytoprotective function of P2X7 through activating AMPK-signaling
  pathway. Vladislav O. Soldatov performed the cytoprotective function by activation
  Complex I of ETC. Marina Y. Skorkina described the toxic function through ROS. Plamena
  R. Angelova developed the toxic function through Ca2+ overload.'
