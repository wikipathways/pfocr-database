caption: Biological pathway analysis using reactome in the liver. (A) Biological pathway
  enrichment for differentially expressed genes for the IF16 regimen as compared to
  AL falls under the categories of immune system, signal transduction and metabolism.
  (B) Biological pathway enrichment for differentially expressed genes for the EOD
  regimen as compared to AL falls under the categories of immune system, signal transduction
  and metabolism, metabolism of proteins, cell cycle, and developmental biology. Every
  other day appears to induce more robust pathway enrichment as compared to IF16.
  AL indicates ad libitum; EOD, every other day; IF, intermittent fasting.
