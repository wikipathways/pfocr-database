caption: In healthy individuals, 5-LO is mainly expressed in leukocytes (light blue
  box). The preferred substrate of 5-LO is ARA (in black). The enzyme also accepts
  a number of other lipids as substrates, including EPA (in blue) and DHA (in green)
  as well as certain monohydroxylated oxylipins such as HETEs (pathway not depicted
  here). The enzymes downstream of 5-LO are expressed either in the same cell or in
  a second cell type (transcellular biosynthesis). ARA arachidonic acid, DHA docosahexaenoic
  acid, EPA eicosapentaenoic acid, HDHA hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid, 5-HEDH 5-hydroxyeicosanoid
  dehydrogenase, HEPE hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid, HETE hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid,
  HpDHA hydroperoxydocosahexaenoic acid, HpETE hydroperoxydocosahexaenoic acid, HpEPE
  hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid, LT leukotriene, LTA4H LTA4 hydrolase, LTC4S LTC4
  synthase, LX lipoxin, LO lipoxygenase, MGST2 microsomal glutathione S-transferase
