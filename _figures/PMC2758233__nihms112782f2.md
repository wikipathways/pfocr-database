caption: Schematic diagram of p75NTR-mediated signal transduction pathways. P75NTR
  interacts with proteins, including TRAF6, RhoA, NRAGE (neurotrophin receptor-interacting
  MAGE homologue), SC-1, and NRIF, and regulates gene expression, the cell cycle,
  apoptosis, mitogenic responses, and growth cone motility. Binding of neurotrophins
  to p75NTR has also been shown to activate the Jun kinase pathway, which can be inhibited
  by activation of the Ras-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by Trk receptors.
  Similar to , adaptor proteins are red, kinase green, small G proteins blue, and
  transcription factors brown. (See text for abbreviations.)
