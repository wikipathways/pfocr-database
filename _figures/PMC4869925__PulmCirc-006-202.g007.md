caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the proximal upstream role of proline-rich
  tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) in hypoxia-induced pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell
  (PASMC) proliferation. Hypoxia induces activation of Pyk2, which in turn activates
  extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, leading to nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) activation, NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) expression, H2O2 generation, and downregulation
  of peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Our previous reports
  demonstrated that the ERK 1/2–NF-κB–Nox4–H2O2pathway was required for hypoxic human
  PASMC proliferation and that reductions in PPARγ were sufficient to activate this
  pathway and the proliferation of pulmonary vascular wall cells. Collectively, these
  findings indicate that hypoxia-induced Pyk2 activation triggers the ERK 1/2–NF-κB–Nox4–H2O2
  cascade to reduce PPARγ levels. Reductions in PPARγ can promote feed-forward activation
  of Pyk2 (dashed arrow), thereby contributing to sustained activation of this proliferative
  signaling cascade. Depletion or inhibition of Pyk2 can attenuate these signaling
  mechanisms, restore PPARγ levels, attenuate proliferation of PASMCs, and thereby
  potentially reduce pulmonary hypertension.
