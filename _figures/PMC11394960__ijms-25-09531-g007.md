caption: 'Contribution of miRs/target genes involved in the innate immune and inflammatory
  response pathway in the liver in Lagovirus europaeus infection. In the liver, increased
  miR-155 expression during L. europaeus/GI.1 and GI.2 genotypes inhibit MyD88 and
  p65 (MyD88—Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.75, p = 0.013, p65—Spearman’s rank
  correlation Rho: −0.93, p < 0.001 for GI.1 and MyD88—Spearman’s rank correlation
  Rho: −0.93, p < 0.001, p65—Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.7, p = 0.02 for GI.2).
  miR-155 induces NLRP3 (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: 0.98, p < 0.001 for GI.1
  and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: 0.8, p < 0.01 for GI.2). Increased expression
  of miR-146a inhibits TRAF6 (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.91, p < 0.001 for
  GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.81, p < 0.01 for GI.2). Enhanced expression
  of miR-223 correlates with reduced expression levels of IKKα (Spearman’s rank correlation
  Rho: −0.87, p = 0.001 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.83, p = 0.003
  for GI.2) and with TLR4 despite a statistically significant increase in this mRNA
  (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.9, p < 0.001 for GI.1 and Spearman’s rank correlation
  Rho: −0.93, p < 0.001 for GI.2). Additionally, an increase miR-125b correlates with
  a decrease in MyD88 (Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.63, p = 0.048 for GI.1
  and Spearman’s rank correlation Rho: −0.8, p = 0.004 for GI.2)'
