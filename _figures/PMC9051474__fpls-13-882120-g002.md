caption: Schematic representation of the flavonoid, carotenoid, and chlorophyll metabolic
  pathway with metabolite and related gene expression levels in the Chuichung and
  Mini cultivars. The pathway was modified from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
  Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The colored squares (blue-to-red)
  represent the relative abundance. The blue characters represent metabolites detected
  through the mass spectrometry, and the relative abundance of these metabolites is
  shown in , .
