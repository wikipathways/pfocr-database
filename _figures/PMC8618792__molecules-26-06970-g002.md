caption: Bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa activate a quorum sensing signaling
  pathway when their population density reaches a particular threshold. In LasI/LasR
  pathway, LasI signaling increases production of quorum sensing inducer, N-3-oxododecanoyl-homoserine
  lactone (3—OC12-HSL). 3—OC12-HSL binds to its cognate receptor LasR, and then increases
  expression of virulence genes. This promotes release of exotoxins and proteases,
  and increases antibiotic resistance as well as biofilm formation, all of which augments
  virulence. LxA4 binds to and inhibits LasR receptor, which reduces Pseudomonas aeruginosa
  virulence.
