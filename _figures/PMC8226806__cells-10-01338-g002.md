caption: Schematic representation of the main known signaling mechanisms for stem/progenitor
  cell recruitment during PH. Receptors (CXCR4, CXCR7, BMPR2, TGF-βR, PDGFR, FGFR2,
  IL-6R, ETR, Fzd, Patch, Notch) and ligands (CXCL12/SDF-1, BMPs, TGF-β, PDGFs, FGF-2,
  ET-1, Wnt, SHH, Notch ligands, respectively) are represented at the membrane of
  progenitor/stem cells regulating their mobilization, proliferation, migration, and/or
  differentiation during PH development. The balance between BMP and TGF-β signaling
  is disrupted, leading to progenitor/stem cell recruitment and participation in remodeling.
  Aberrant HIF-1α activation enhances the proliferative responses and differentiation
  of SPC, SMC, and pericytes to mitogens, such as PDGF and FGF-2 via PDGFR and FGFR2
  receptors. Disrupted glucose metabolism with an increase in the O-GlcNAcylation,
  the glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathways could induce progenitor/stem
  cell recruitment and also participate in the stabilization of HIF-1α. BMP and TGF-β
  receptors are multimodal receptors consisting of various combinations of type I
  and type II. BMPR2 and TGF-βRII are represented here. ETR = ETA or ETB receptors.
  Black arrows represent the increased or decreased activity of pathways observed
  during PH development. Thick green arrows represent the positive effect of pathways
  on progenitor/stem cell recruitment or function. Dotted green arrows represent potential
  regulatory pathways derived from studies in other systems. The red dotted line represents
  a reduced inhibitory effect of the BMPR2 pathway on progenitor/stem cell recruitment
  or function.
