caption: Schematic representation of TrkB and p75NTR pathways in normal hearing and
  in sensorineural hearing loss. In normal hearing cochlea (A), mBDNF binds TrkB receptor
  on the plasma membrane of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and activates PI3K/AKT
  pathway. PI3K phosphorylates and activates AKT (phosphorylation sites indicated
  by yellow spots), which in turn phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB, which
  translocates into the nucleus and induces pro-survival gene expression. In damaged
  cochlea (B), pro-BDNF binds the p75NTR receptor on the SGN plasma membrane and activates
  signalling proteins such as TRAF6 and JNK, which are involved in the activation
  of c-JUN and caspases, leading to cell death. IHCs, inner hair cells; OHCs, outer
  hair cells; Afs, afferent fibres; SGNs, spiral ganglion neurons; TrkB, tropomyosin
  receptor kinase B; PI3K, phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase; AKT, protein kinase B;
  CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein; p75NTR, p75 neurotrophin receptor;
  TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases; c-JUN, transcription
  factor Jun.
