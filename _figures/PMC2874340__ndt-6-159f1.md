  Homocysteine synthesis is elevated but total remethylation is unchanged by the methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase 677C->T polymorphism and by dietary folate restriction in young women.
  J Nutr. 2005;135(5):1045–1050.Notes: This schematic is of the folate cycle (left),
  methionine cycle (right), and transsulfuration pathway (bottom), with homocysteine
  being the common substance to all three. Folic acid (synthetic) is converted by
  DHFR to dihydrofolic acid (dietary), which is converted by DHFR to THF, which enters
  the folate cycle: THF →N5,N10-methylene THF → N5-methyl THF → THF. In this last
  step, vitamin B12 is required as a cofactor for MS. With low or absent vitamin B12,
  this last step is hindered leading to the methylfolate trap with elevated CH3-THF.
  Homocysteine metabolism: homocysteine is produced in the methionine cycle by the
  deadenosylation/hydration of AdoHcy, and is either remethylated to methionine, by
  the methionine cycle or catabolized to cysteine, by the transsulfuration pathway.
  Note the AdoHcy deadenosylation/hydration to Hcy is a reversible reaction favoring
  homocysteine adenosylation/hydration to AdoHcy. Methyl groups produced by AdoMet
  demethylation to AdoHcy are used for nucleic acid, protein, lipid, and neurotransmitter
  biosynthesis. Cysteine is a nonessential amino acid used in the biosynthesis of
  proteins, glutathione, coenzyme A, taurine, and inorganic sulfur. Glutathione is
  an antioxidant that protects cells from ROS.Abbreviations: AdoHcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; BHMT, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase; CBS,
  cystathionine β-synthase; CGL, cystathionine gamma-lyase; CH2THF, methylenetetrahydrofolate;
  -CH3, methyl group; CH3THF methyl tetrahydrofolate; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase;
