caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showing the plasma membrane and extracellular
  proteins directly related to YAP1. The relation to proteins involved in mechanotransduction
  include the cell membrane protein PATJ (crumbs cell polarity complex component),
  which is directly related to YAP1 and is also interacting with PIEZO1, the Piezo
  type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1. YAP1 is also an indirect regulator
  of both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2. Further, the cytokine endothelin 1 (EDN1) is directly
  related to YAP1 and is also a regulator of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channels
  (DEG/ENaC, here marked as SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, SCNN1D). Tight junction signaling
  proteins related to YAP1 include CTNNA1, MPDZMPP5, OCLN, PATJ, TJP2. Epithelial
  adherens junction signaling proteins related to YAP1 include CDH1, CTNNA1, CTNNA2,
  EGFR, FGF1, PARD3, ZYX. Examples of secreted proteins involved in creating a pro-fibrotic
  microenvironment include AREG, CTGF, CYR61, FGF1, and MSLN and these YAP1 target
  genes are highlighted and were chosen for further in vitro confirmation
papertitle: YAP1 is an independent prognostic marker in pancreatic cancer and associated
  with extracellular matrix remodeling.
