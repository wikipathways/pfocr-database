caption: Figure 1. A schematic model of ethylene biosynthesis showing a few of its
  components as affected by NO during fruit ripening. (Straight arrows indicate established
  phenomena; dotted arrows indicate phenomena of unidentified mechanisms). Ethylene
  is perceived by a family of five membrane bound receptors (ETR1, ETR2, ERS1, ERS2
  and EIN4) which are characterized having a sensor and a response regulator domain.
  In the absence of ethylene, the receptors activate the kinase activity of CTR1 (constitutive
  triple response 1) a negative regulator that suppresses downstream progression of
  signaling. CTR1 then actively suppresses the downstream responses, such that EIN2
  and the EIN3/EIL family of transcription factors remain inactive. Upon perception
  of ethylene, the receptors no longer activate CTR1, thus activating the EIN3/EIL
  family of transcription factors. Ethylene insensitive 3 (EIN3) target is thought
  to be the ethylene response factor 1 (ERF1) gene. ERF1 encodes an ethylene response
  element binding protein (EREBP) that binds the GCC-box, a cis-element of many ethylene
  response genes, thus activating the ethylene-signaling pathway. In the ethylene
  cascade, autocatalytic activity of ethylene is reported to form SAM (S-adenosyl
  methionine) from methionine (MT) which is catalyzed by SAM synthetase, whereas SAM
  is catalyzed into Aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACC synthase and further
  oxidized into ethylene by ACC oxidase. Ethylene biosynthesis in this route was found
  affected by NO mainly through inhibition of SAM turnover via S-nitrosylation of
  transcriptionally produced methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT). Further, genes
  coding for ACCS and ACCO were downregulated (┴) by NO accounting for the reduction
  of ethylene. Stoichiometric reduction of ACC to 1-melonyl aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic
  acid (MACC) and formation of a stable ternary ACC-ACCO-NO complex can also antagonize
  ethylene formation. Alternatively, reciprocal interaction of NO and hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) were also presumed affecting MAP kinase-mediated downstream components of
  ethylene biosynthesis. Growth regulators (GRs) and NO may also influence redox status
  and other signal generation. As a consequence, NO affects the yield of ethylene,
  thus delaying expressions of enzymes responsible for cell wall degradation, lignification
  and pigmentation of fruits conferring shelf life extension.
