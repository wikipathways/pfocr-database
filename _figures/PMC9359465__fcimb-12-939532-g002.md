caption: Molecular mechanisms of blood–brain barrier dysfunction. The binding of P.
  falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) to the receptors on the ECs,
  including ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and EPCR, may trigger multiple signaling pathways in ECs,
  leading to the change to cytoskeleton-associated proteins, ultimately resulting
  in the disruption of the BBB. Meanwhile, signaling pathways triggered by PfEMP1
  lead to activation and injury of astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and perivascular
  macrophages and initiate the process of neuropathological injury. The binding of
  PfEMP1 to EPCR fosters the activation of tissue factors Va and VIIIa, thereby disrupting
  the anticoagulant pathway. Activation of these tissue factors results in thrombin
  generation, leading to fibrin deposition. Microglia also disrupt the BBB by producing
  TNF and IL-1β. Astrocytes retract their end feet from ECs, resulting in reduced
  vascular wrapping. Angiopoietin-2 produced by ECs also leads to reduced vascular
  wrapping by inducing pericyte dysfunction. The iRBCs stimulate leukocytes to release
  inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β) by releasing parasitic toxins. These
  cytokines disrupt BBB integrity by altering tight junctions and activating ECs to
  release chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL4, CXCL8, and CXCL10), which promote leukocyte
  accumulation, including CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Infiltrated leukocytes induce
  EC apoptosis through granzyme B and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity. Granzyme B and
  perforin directly induce neuronal cell death. Adhesion of iRBCs, leukocytes, and
  platelets to ECs also causes EC damage and irreversible changes. Due to the increased
  permeability of the BBB, cytokines, chemokines, immune cells, and plasma factors
  flood into the brain parenchyma and activate neurons and astrocytes, resulting in
  nerve injury and neurological sequelae. Kynurenic acid produced by macrophages and
  ECs during tryptophan metabolism is further converted into cytotoxic quinoline,
  which plays a vital role in stromal cells and microglia. These molecules induce
  the disruption of the BBB.
