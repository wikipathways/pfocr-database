caption: Design of CRISPRi-assisted metabolic engineering of S. elongatusstrains for
  photosynthetic HA production (a) A scheme of the metabolic pathway for HA production
  in engineered S. elongatus strain. Heterologous gene was introduced for overexpression
  of metabolic enzymes (GlmS, GlmM, GlmU, HasA, HasB, and HasC; shown in blue). The
  CRISPRi (or dCas12a-mediated system) was used to repress the target gene. The target
  gene (nagB, zwf, glgC, and pfk) was selected for gene repression (shown in red).
  (b) A programmable dCas12a-mediated gene repression for S. elongatus PCC 7942. A
  protospacer was selected to interfere the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP). The
  protospacer sequences for the targets were shown in Table S3. (c) A scheme of the
  CRISPRi module with target crRNAs. A CRISPRi module, comprising inducible dCas12a
  and crRNA expression, was integrated into neutral site III (NSIII). DR; direct repeat,
  PS; protospacer. (Table 1)
