caption: The function of Hsp70 in suppressing apoptosis after ischemic stroke. Hsp70
  protect cytochrome c (Cyt C) release from mitochondria. Apoptosome formation is
  interrupted by Hsp70 binding to Cyt C and procaspase-9 (Casp 9). Hsp70 also prevents
  release of AIF and Samc/DIABLO from mitochondria. Hsp70 can also prevent the death
  receptor signaling pathway. Arrows indicated increased activity or amount, and the
  barred ends indicates steps that are interrupted or reduced when Hsp70 is induced.
