caption: The ERK1/2 pathway in airway epithelial cell responses to cigarette smoke.
  Cigarette smoke exposure has been shown to activate the EGFR in lung epithelial
  cells. Following dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR, a cascade of adaptor
  molecules and GTPases leads to the recruitment of Raf1 to the plasma membrane and
  its activation. Raf1 is a MAP kinase kinase kinase, which phosphorylates the MAP
  kinase kinase MEK1/2. MEK1/2 activation leads to phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAP kinase,
  which can translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate transcription factors which
  bind to regulatory elements in the promoters of target genes, inducing their expression.
  Transcription factors that are phosphorylated by ERK1/2 include Sp1, Ets1, AP-1,
  and ELK-1. Cigarette smoke-mediated activation of this cascade in lung epithelial
  cells is associated with hyperplasia, MMP-1 expression, MUC5AC expression, and release
  of EGF ligand. The list of transcription factors and cell responses is not comprehensive.
