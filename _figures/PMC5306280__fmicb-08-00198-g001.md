caption: Activation of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Simplified schematic presentation
  of NF-κB activation by different cellular receptors. Binding of the TCR-CD3 complex
  to antigens presented by MHC molecules induces LCK-dependent phosphorylation of
  ITAMs in the cytoplasmic tail of CD3. This in turn recruits ZAP70, which induces
  a signal cascade involving activation of PLCγ1 and PKC    . Alternatively, PKC     can
  also be activated via a signal cascade including PI3K following binding of the TCR
  costimulatory factor CD28 to a B7 ligand. PKC     subsequently activates the CBM
  complex consisting of CARD11, BCL10 and MALT1, which activates TAK1 in a TRAF6 dependent
  manner. Ligand binding to TLRs or TNF receptors also induces TAK1 activation in
  a TRAF6- or TRAF2-dependent manner, respectively. In humans (and to a much lesser
  extent in chimpanzees), the cellular restriction factor tetherin also acquired the
  ability to activate NF-κB. Upon tethering of newly formed viral particles and clustering
  of tetherin dimers, the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin becomes phosphorylated at a
  conserved YxY motif by a Scr-family kinase in a RICH2-dependent manner, recruiting
  SYK, which initiates a signaling cascade involving TRAF2 and/or TRAF6 resulting
  in the activation of TAK1. TAK1 subsequently phosphorylates IKKβ at two serine residues
  in the activation loop to activate IKK. Furthermore, TRAFs activate NEMO by poly-ubiquitination,
  followed by activation of the catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ. Subsequently, IκB
  is phosphorylated and poly-ubiquitinated by the SCF/β-TrCP complex, which results
  in its proteasomal degradation, thereby releasing p50/p65 heterodimers, which translocate
  to the nucleus where they bind to specific κB binding sites and initiate NF-κB-dependent
  gene expression.
