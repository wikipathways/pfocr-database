caption: Main therapeutic targets along the BCR signaling pathway in CLL cells. Aggregation
  of the BCR by antigen induces the phosphorylation of the ITAMs within the cytoplasmic
  tails of the Ig-α/Ig-β heterodimer. Phosphorylation of the ITAMs is mediated by
  LYN or other members of the SRC family kinases. SYK is subsequently recruited to
  the phosphorylated ITAMs and activated by a multistep process that involves phosphorylation
  by SRC family kinases and trans-autophosphorylation. SYK further propagates the
  signal by phosphorylating and recruiting several signaling intermediates, such as
  BLNK, BCAP, VAV, SHC and PI3K. Recruitment of PI3K leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3) and subsequent BTK and AKT activation. SYK and BTK then activate PLCγ2, which
  produces the second messengers inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol
  (DAG). These second messengers induce the release of intracellular Ca2+ and activate
  PKC, which then activate the transcription factors NF-κB and NFAT. PKC also induces
  the expression of the phosphatase PTPN22, which dephosphorylates and inactivates
  LYN. This event prevents LYN-mediated recruitment and activation of the phosphatase
  SHIP, which is a key negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In the absence
  of active SHIP, AKT continues to be activated by PIP3, resulting in amplification
  of the BCR survival signal. BCR signaling molecules that have been studied as potential
  therapeutic targets in CLL are depicted in grey.

  description: Main therapeutic targets along the BCR signaling pathway in CLL cells.
    Aggregation of the BCR by antigen induces the phosphorylation of the ITAMs within

    is mediated by LYN or other members of the SRC family kinases. SYK is subsequently

    SYK further propagates the signal by phosphorylating and recruiting several signaling
    intermediates, such as BLNK, BCAP, VAV, SHC and PI3K. Recruitment of PI3K leads
    to the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) and subsequent
