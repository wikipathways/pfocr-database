caption: Molecular mechanisms of ethanol-associated OESCC. After ingestion, ethanol
  is quickly absorbed through the stomach and duodenum into blood stream, and metabolized
  mainly in the liver. Ethanol is oxidized into acetaldehyde by ADH, CYP2E1 and catalase,
  and then into acetate by ALDH. Systemic metabolism of ethanol causes reduction of
  retinoid, zinc and methyl group and accumulation of iron. Through the blood stream,
  ethanol is circulated to the oro-esophageal epithelium and salivary glands. In the
  saliva, ethanol is oxidized by microbes to acetaldehyde. When ethanol and acetaldehyde
  contact oro-esophageal epithelial cells, ethanol perturbs the lipid bilayer of cell
  membrane and interferes the function of intrinsic membrane proteins, such as TLR4,
  Notch, Shh and Wnt pathway receptors, and thus activates or inhibits downstream
  signaling. Inside the epithelial cells, ethanol metabolism causes oxidative damages
  to DNA, proteins and lipids, and modulates fatty acid metabolism as well. These
  systemic and local effects of ethanol and acetaldehyde stimulate cell proliferation,
  inflammation and angiogenesis, and suppress squamous cell differentiation, and therefore
  promote OESCC.
