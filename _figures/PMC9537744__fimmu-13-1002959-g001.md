caption: 'The metabolic pathway of cyclophosphamide. (A). Cy (prodrug) is activated
  by the hepatic CYP450 to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide, which stays in equilibrium with
  aldophosphamide. These two metabolites diffuse into cells. Depending on the type
  of cell, in cells with low concentration of ALDH (sensitive cells as lymohocytes),
  aldophosphamide is spontaneously converted to phosphoramide mustard and acrolein.
  However, in cells with high concentration of ALDH (resistant cells such as hematopoietic
  stem cells) aldophosphamide is converted to carboxyphosphamide (inactive). (B) shows
  SNPs effect in Cy metabolism enzymes: SNPs in CYP450 and GSTs enzymes lead to decreased
  activity enzyme and produce low level of phosphoramide mustard and high level of
  toxic metabolites, respectively. This SNPs lead to higher incidence of GVHD, SOS
  and TRM.'
