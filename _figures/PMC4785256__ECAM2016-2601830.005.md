caption: Mechanisms of Kuijie Granule in suppressing ulcerative colitis. Kuijie Granule
  can improve the clinical symptoms (diarrhea, mucous bloody stool, abdominal pain,
  abdominal distention, and tenesmus) in UC patients by regulating TGF-β/Smads signal
  transduction pathway. Kuijie Granule decreased the expression of TGF-β1, increased
  the expression of TGF-βRII, Smad4, and Smad7, and has no effect on Smad2 and Smad6
  expression; then, the decreasing of the phosphorylation of anti-inflammation signal
  proteins and the blocking of the expression of inflammation signal proteins finally
  reduced inflammation reaction to improve or cure UC. Interactions leading to activation
  of molecular targets are indicated by arrows; those that are inhibited are indicated
  by a bar.
