caption: Illustrative representation of molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced non-communicable
  diseases. a, obesity-induced type 2 diabetes. (i) The insulin signaling pathway
  begins with phosphorylated IRS1/2 activates the PI3K-Akt/PKB and MAPK signaling
  pathways which regulate metabolic processes and growth signaling. Pro-inflammatory
  factors secreted by obese WATME trigger the activation of (ii) the MAPK and (iii)
  the JAK/STAT signaling pathways, which subsequently inhibit insulin signaling, impair
  insulin sensitivity, and ultimately result in insulin resistance. b, obesity-induced
  coronary heart disease. Pro-inflammatory factors secreted by obese WATME exert atherogenic
  effects by generating RONS through the activation of (iv) the IKK/NF-κB, JAK/STAT/NF-κB,
  and (v) the Ang II signaling pathways. Additionally, the pro-inflammatory factors
  generate vasoconstrictors through activating (vi) the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.
  c, obesity-induced breast cancer. Obese WATME facilitates the progression and metastasis
  of breast cancer by activating (vii) the MAPK/p38, the PI3K/PKB, and (viii) the
  JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways
