caption: Exosomes are involved in the disease progression of DPN. miR-21-5p carried
  by DRG neurons-Exo increases TNF-α, IL-6 and other inflammatory factors, inducing
  inflammatory reactions. miR-146a carried by BM-MSCs-Exo also increases TNF-α, mediating
  the inflammatory reaction. The increases in miR-28, -31a and -130a in Schwann cells-Exo
  target DNMT-3A, NUMB, SNAP-25 and GAP-43, which causes axon ischemia, hypoxia and
  abnormal metabolism and inhibits axon growth. BM-MSCs-Exo carry let-7a, miR-17,
  miR-23 and other molecules that target the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway, which leads
  to a decrease in neurotrophic factors. Under high glucose conditions, part of the
  reason for the damage to the nervous system is the disturbance of nervous system
  homeostasis caused by oxidative stress and increased apoptosis. AS-Exos activate
  ROS and target the Ras/AMPK signaling pathway, causing mitochondrial dysfunction
  and apoptosis. DPN, diabetic peripheral neuropathy; BM-MSCs-Exo, exosomes derived
  from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells; ROS, reactive oxygen species; miR, microRNA;
  DRG, dorsal root ganglia; DNMT-3A, DNA methyltransferase 3A; SNAP-25, synaptosome
  protein 25; GRP-43, growth-associated protein 43; AS, astrocytes; AMPK, adenosine
  monophosphate-activated protein kinase.
