caption: 'Genetic engineering approach for increasing α-santalene production. (A)
  Expression plasmid pISP15 containing tHMG1 encoding truncated HMG-CoA reductase,
  a codon optimized santalene synthase gene (SanSynopt) PTEF1 and PPGK1 promoters
  as well as TADH1 and TCYC1 terminator sequences. (B) Integrated cassettes, rectangles
  containing arrows represent the promoters and their directionality, pentagons the
  genes and empty squares the terminators. (C) Scheme of the engineered mevalonate,
  prenyl phosphate and ammonium assimilation pathways and FPP branch point; overexpressed
  and deleted genes are highlighted. Pathway intermediates: G6P: glucose-6-phosphate,
  Acetyl-CoAcyt: cytosolic acetyl-CoA, HMG-CoA: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, MVA:
  mevalonate, MVA-P: phosphomevalonate, MVA-PP: diphosphomevalonate, IPP: isopentenyl
  diphosphate, DMAPP: dimethylallyl diphosphate, GPP: geranyl diphosphate, FPP: farnesyl
  diphosphate, FOH: farnesol. Overexpressed genes are tHMG1 (encoding truncated HMG-CoA
  reductase), ERG20 (encoding FPP synthase), GDH2 (encoding NAD-dependent glutamate
  dehydrogenase), and SanSynopt (encoding α-santalene synthase). Deleted genes are
  GDH1 (encoding NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase), LPP1 and DPP1 (both encoding
  lipid phosphate phosphatases). The promoter of the ERG9 gene (encoding squalene
  synthase) is replaced with PHXT1. Genes whose promoters contain Upc2 binding sites
  are indicated with a grey arrow: ERG13 (encoding HMG-CoA synthase), ERG12 (encoding
  mevalonate kinase), and ERG8 (encoding phosphomevalonate kinase). Additional genes
  indicated are ERG10 (encoding acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase), ERG19 (encoding diphosphomevalonate
  decarboxylase) and IDI (encoding IPP isomerase).'
