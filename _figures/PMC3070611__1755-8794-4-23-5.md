caption: The shortest pathway identified by our system. Pathways including the gene
  CEBPD and SOD1 were the shortest pathways in our computational results, which indicates
  SOD1 (p-value = 4.01E-04) does not interact with other genes or pathways. We were
  curious about what caused the chemoresistant mechanism after SOD1 was regulated.
  Cisplatin caused DNA damage as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered
  cell cycle arrest or/and apoptosis. Cisplatin induced CEBPD by an as of yet unidentified
  mechanism which activated the SOD1 gene expression. Superoxide anion (O2•-) is dismutated
  by SOD1 and converted to H2O2 which can be further neutralized to water and oxygen
  by catalase []. The reduced ROS levels in their model caused the cisplatin-resistant
  phenotype. These results call for an assessment of CEBPD and SOD1 expression in
  bladder tumors as a potential means of predicting cisplatin resistance. According
  to our computational results, SOD1 has significant differential expressions between
  chemosensitive and chemoresistant array data and is activated by CEBPD as well.
  We may make a reasonable assumption that this phenomenon occurs in ovarian chemoresistance.
  Based on this biological evidence and our computational experiment results, we can
  infer that SOD1 plays a critical role in ovarian chemoresistance.
