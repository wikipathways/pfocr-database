caption: The Isc pathway is located in the mitochondrion while the Suf pathway is
  located in the apicoplast. The exclusive division of the two pathways between the
  two endosymbiont organelles suggests that the FeS-dependent proteins the apicoplast
  rely solely on the Suf FeS cluster synthesis pathway. When the Suf pathway was disrupted
  by expressing the dominant negative probe SufC(K140A) the apicoplast was no longer
  maintained. One or more of the FeS cluster dependent proteins present in the apicoplast
  could be required for maintenance of the organelle.
