caption: The intracellular cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptor RIG-I is essential
  for the control of RNA virus infection. Upon IAV recognition, RIG-I recruits the
  adaptor MAVS protein to activate the IKKα–IKKβ and TBK1–IKKϵ complexes, which are
  responsible for the activation of the IRF 3 and IRF7 transcription factors. These
  transcription factors then translocate into the nucleus and cooperatively induce
  IRF dependent type I IFNs and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
  activated B cells) dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This is
  followed by the binding of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 to their cognate receptor, which
  leads to the transcriptional activation of ISGs by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
  The products of ISGs are key factors limiting pathogen spreading. Moreover, ssRNA
  from IAVs can prime the inflammasome by activating a TLR inducing NF-κB activation
  and the expression of NLRP3, ASC, and preforms of IL-18 and IL-1β. A second activation
  signal is provided by the oligomerization of the NLRP3 complex and recruitment of
  ASC and procaspase-1, allowing the processing and cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  precursors into their bioactive mature forms (IL-18 and IL-1β). NLRP3 can be activated
  by imbalances in potassium ion concentration in intracellular vesicles through the
  ATP-gated P2 × 7 channel and responses of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.
