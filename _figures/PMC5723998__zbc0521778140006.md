caption: 'Probable sites of ROS formation during LCFA degradation and the mechanisms
  employed by ubiquinone to mitigate LCFA-induced oxidative stress. Exogenous LCFAs
  are transported inside the cell by an outer membrane protein, FadL. Subsequently,
  the inner membrane-associated acyl-CoA synthetase, FadD, extracts LCFAs from the
  inner membrane concomitant with esterification to acyl-CoA. Acyl-CoAs are degraded
  to acetyl-CoA via the β-oxidation pathway mediated by enzymatic activities of FadE,
  FadB, and FadA. Acetyl-CoA feeds into the TCA cycle for further metabolism. High
  NADH/NAD+ and FADH2/FAD ratios during β-oxidation and TCA cycle increase the electron
  flow in the ETC thereby increasing electron leakage and autoxidation of the reduced
  form of NADH dehydrogenase resulting in ROS formation. In addition, a predominant
  source of ROS could be the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, FadE, which reduces FAD to FADH2.
  Ubiquinone limits ROS formation by rapidly transferring electrons from upstream
  dehydrogenases to terminal oxidases (Cyo and Cyd) thus preventing electron leakage
  and autoxidation of the reduced form of dehydrogenases. In addition, the quinol
  peroxidase activity of Cyd will detoxify H2O2. Arrows with e− labeled on the line
  show the direction of electron transfer. Dotted arrows indicate reactions for which
  either the components involved are not known (oxidation of FadE and electron transfer
  from FadE to the ETC) or the mechanisms are not established in vivo (detoxification
  of H2O2 by Cyd). Abbreviations: Oaa, oxaloacetate; Cit, citrate; Isocit, isocitrate;
