caption: Activation of inflammatory pathway mediated through NF-κB by life-style related
  factors such as tobacco, stress, dietary agents, obesity, alcohol, infectious agents,
  irradiation and environmental stimuli that account for as much as 95% of all cancers.
  Suppression of inflammatory pathway by life style –related agents such as vegetables,
  fruits, legumes, grains, spices and exercise (such as Yoga), is indicated.
