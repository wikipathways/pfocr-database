caption: Mitochondrial sulfide-oxidizing pathway. Scheme depicting the enzymatic components
  and metabolites involved in sulfide oxidation in the mitochondria. H2S is initially
  oxidized by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), which transfers electron equivalents
  to quinones and generates glutathione persulfide (GSSH) as coproduct. Electrons
  are transferred to O2 via complex III (c.III), cytochrome c (Cc), and complex IV
  (c.IV), contributing to membrane energization and ATP synthesis. GSSH, with O2 as
  cosubstrate, is then converted by persulfide dioxygenase (ETHE1) to sulfite (SO32−)
  and GSH. Sulfite can be converted, with GSSH as cosubstrate, into thiosulfate (S2O32−)
  by rhodanese (Rhod), or oxidized into sulfate (SO42−) by sulfite oxidase (SOx).
