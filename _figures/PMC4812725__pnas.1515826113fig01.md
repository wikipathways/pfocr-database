caption: Taxol biosynthesis schematic. The schematic depicts an abbreviated overview
  of the Taxol pathway, beginning with this work's carbon source glycerol. From glycerol,
  the basic metabolic building blocks of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate
  (PYR) are made. These building blocks are then carried through the methylerythritol
  phosphate (MEP) pathway to create the ubiquitous isoprenoid precursors IPP and DMAPP.
  IPP and DMAPP then are polymerized and cyclized by GGPPS and TxS to form the 20-carbon
  backbone taxa-4 (5),11 (12)-diene (taxadiene). The blue star indicates the focus
  of this study, which is the putative next pathway the fifth carbon hydroxylation
  as performed by the cytochrome P450 CYP725A4 and its reductase partner. Further
  decoration leads to the advanced intermediate Baccatin III, which combined with
  group transfer produces the final Taxol compound.
