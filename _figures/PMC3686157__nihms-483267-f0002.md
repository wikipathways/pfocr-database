caption: CREB phosphorylation may be inhibited through inhibition of the PKA pathway,
  the Uch-L1 proteasomal system, aberrant calpain activity, or inhibition of the cGK
  pathway. In addition, high β-amyloid levels may reduce histone acetylation, which
  can impair gene expression necessary for learning and memory. See the text for details.
