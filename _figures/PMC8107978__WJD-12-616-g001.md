caption: 'A brief scheme of the insulin signaling pathway under physiological conditions.
  After insulin binds to its own receptor, several pathways are activated/inactivated,
  resulting in an anabolic state of insulin. The autophosphorylation of insulin receptor
  tyrosine kinase is followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate.
  The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/serine/threonine-specific protein kinase B (AKT)
  signaling pathway promotes glucose uptake and glycogen and lipid synthesis while
  inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipolysis. Moreover, AKT kinases activate
  mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1, which promotes de novo synthesis of proteins
  and lipids. An additional insulin signaling pathway via Src homology 2 domain-containing
  transforming proteins and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related
  kinase pathway promotes cell proliferation and protein synthesis. Dotted lines represent
  inhibition, and solid lines represent stimulation/activation. IRS: Insulin receptor
  substrate; SHC: Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming proteins; MEK: Mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; ERK: Extracellular signal-related kinase; PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase;
  AKT: Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase B; mTORC: Mechanistic target of rapamycin
  complex.'
