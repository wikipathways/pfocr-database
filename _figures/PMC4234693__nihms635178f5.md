caption: Influence of MAPK signals on the Wnt pathway. Expression of constitutively
  active MKK6, an upstream activator of p38 MAPK, in 293T cells increased the expression
  of β-catenin proteins through direct phosphorylation of GSK3β protein both in vitro
  and in vivo; this phosphorylation was blocked by SB203580 or the knock-out (KO)
  of MKK3 and MKK6 (). Members of MAPKs such as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK contributed
  to the phosphorylation of PPPS/TP clusters of endogenous LDL-related protein 6 (LRP6)
  phosphorylation, stimulating Wnt/β-catenin expression. Rac1, a small signaling G
  protein, could activate JNK2 to phosphorylate β-catenin (). In Xenopus embryos,
  activation of JNK antagonized the canonical Wnt pathway through activating the nuclear
  export of β-catenin rather than maintaining its cytoplasmic stability (). Receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTK) systems facilitated Wnt/β-catenin signaling by the PI3K/AKT
  pathway through inhibiting GSK3 activities (); RTKs could also phosphorylate β-catenin
  through involving ERK/LRP6 pathways to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling ().
