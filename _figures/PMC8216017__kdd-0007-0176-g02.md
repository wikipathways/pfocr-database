caption: The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis-mediated signaling network in DKD. The CXCL12/CXCR4
  axis plays a dual regulatory role in DKD. On the one hand, CXCL12/CXCR4 leads to
  TEC decrease, mesangial expansion reduction, and podocyte survival, which contribute
  to diabetic renoprotection. TEC death is decreased via BAD and Akt phosphorylation
  while fibronectin expression and ECM accumulation are inhibited through PI3K/Akt
  signal pathway, reducing mesangial expansion. On the other hand, the CXCL12/CXCR4
  axis mediates podocyte reduction by reducing podocyte progenitor cell differentiation
  into podocytes via inhibiting Notch signal transduction, resulting in DKD progression.
  DKD, diabetic kidney disease; TEC, tubular epithelia cell; ECM, extracellular matrix.
