caption: SLC7A11 regulates nutrient dependency of cancer cells. This schematic represents
  cells with high expression of SLC7A11. a Under normal conditions, SLC7A11 exports
  large amounts of intracellular glutamate in exchange for extracellular cystine.
  Cystine imported by SLC7A11 is converted to cysteine that supports glutathione biosynthesis
  and ROS detoxification. However, SLC7A11-mediated glutamate export limits intracellular
  glutamate supply to the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration, rendering such
  cells more dependent on glucose and/or glutamine supply for survival and growth.
  Glutamine is the major precursor for glutamate. Glucose provides the major carbon
  source for the TCA cycle as well as NADPH for glutathione biosynthesis and ROS detoxification.
  b Under glucose-deprived conditions, cells with high expression of SLC7A11 lack
  adequate supplies to maintain the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration. In addition,
  cystine imported by SLC7A11 depletes NAPDH and induces ROS under glucose deprivation
  conditions, possibly because cystine conversion to cysteine consumes NADPH, which
  is largely provided by glucose. These events result in enhanced cell death of SLC7A11-high
  cancer cells under glucose starvation. OXPHOS oxidative phosphorylation, PPP pentose
