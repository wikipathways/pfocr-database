caption: Illustration of SPIO@15HA nanocomposites’ impacts on BMMs oriented osteoclastogenesis
  and MSCs oriented osteogenesis. After tail vein injection, SPIO@15HA nanocomposites
  were accumulated in bone marrow and affected the bone remodeling process by suppressing
  osteoclastogenesis and stimulating osteogenesis. SPIO@15HA blocks RANKL induced
  osteoclastogenesis of BMMs through p62 upregulation resulted deubiquitination of
  TRAF6 by over CYLD recruitment, thus leading to the signal transduction termination
  of RANKL activated pathway. SPIO@15HA also increases the expression of OPG by MSCs,
  which competitively inhibits RANKL/RANK combination. On the other side, TGF-β, PI3K-AKT
  signaling and calcium homeostasis related to osteogenic differentiation are activated
  in MSCs when interacting with SPIO@15HA nanocomposites
