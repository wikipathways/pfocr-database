caption: TNFα, released from macrophages or microglial cells, stimulates the p38 mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway to increase phosphorylation (P) of cAMP response
  element (CRE)-binding (CREB), a transcription factor known to regulate the BDNF
  gene. In turn, CREB phosphorylation leads to activation of exon IV of the BDNF gene,
  and subsequent BDNF mRNA and protein synthesis. Neuronal depolarization, dependent
  on tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) sodium channels, increases intracellular cAMP,
  which acts through several putative mechanisms to potentiate the TNFα regulation
  of BDNF transcription. For example, cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), a well-established
  mechanism of CREB phosphorylation. In addition, cAMP is a likely mediator of depolarization-induced
  upregulation of p38 MAPK activity.
