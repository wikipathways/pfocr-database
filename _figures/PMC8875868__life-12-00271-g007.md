caption: PPP pathway and the relationship between G6PD, NADPH and GSH. Elliptical
  shape represents a protein. Square shape represents a chemical. GR is glutathione
  reductase, which can transform NADPH and GSSG into NADP + and GSH. Downregulation
  of PRMT6 enhances G6PD expression and promotes drug resistance.
