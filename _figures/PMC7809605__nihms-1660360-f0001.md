caption: Potential therapeutic effects of polyphenols. Metal chelation occurs via
  coordination with oxophilic transition metals, such as Cu, Zn, and Fe, which are
  abundant in the CNS. Transition metals can induce ROS, which damage the genome.
  Therefore, polyphenols have DNA protection activity. Polyphenols modulate the AβPP
  pathway in two different ways. One pathway activates α-secretase by removing the
  pro-domain, which induces the non-amyloidogenic pathway. A second pathway favors
  neuroprotection, wherein polyphenols inhibit the β-site amyloid protein precursor
  cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), leading to decreased Aβ concentration. Polyphenols also
  promote Aβ clearance through non-covalent interactions with amino acid residues
  that disrupt Aβ structure stability, thus leading to fibril disaggregation. Polyphenols
  can also induce mitochondrial biogenesis by stimulating PGC-1α.
