caption: Distinct signaling pathways are directly involved in the phenotypic determination
  of visceral and vascular SMCs. Maintenance of a differentiated phenotype of SMCs
  depends on the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway. In contrast, the coordinate activation of
  the ERK and p38MAPK pathways induces SMC de-differentiation. IGF-I, which is a potent
  factor for maintaining the differentiated SMC phenotype, activates the signaling
  pathway mediated through PI3-K/PKB(Akt), but not MAPKs. Blocking the PI3-K/PKB(Akt)
  pathway with specific inhibitors of PI3-K, LY249002, or wortmannin, induces SMC
  de-differentiation. Potent SMC de-differentiation-inducing factors, PDGF-BB, bFGF,
  and EGF, all activate the ERK and p38MAPK pathways. bFGF and EGF do not enhance
  the PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway, whereas, PDGF-BB does activate it. Thus, PDGF-BB triggers
  the dual signaling pathways, PI3-K/PKB(Akt) and two MAPKs. When the ERK and p38MAPK
  pathways were simultaneously blocked by their specific inhibitors, PD98059 and SB203580,
  PDGF-BB in turn initiates to induce maintaining SMC differentiation. Therefore,
  the SMC phenotype would be determined by the balance between the strengths of the
  PI3-K/PKB(Akt) pathway and the ERK and p38MAPK pathways.
