  be common in Singaporean population. After that, five criteria have been used to
  prioritize the common SNPs. We did detailed SNP analysis for 15 common nsSNPs that
  passed at least 3 out of 5 criteria and some borderline SNPs. Finally, after thorough
  literature review, we selected six SNPs to be genotyped in the NSCLC Singaporean
