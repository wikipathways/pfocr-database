caption: Schematic diagram of related metabolic pathways in cyp5011A1KO compared with
  WT. Differential metabolites are marked in blue text with colored square box in
  schematic diagram. The colors within the square boxes indicate the metabolites’
  level in cells. Arrows represent the direction of reactions. Dotted black solid
  arrows indicate metabolites that indirectly participate in reaction steps, while
  dashed black hollow arrows indicate metabolites involved in other metabolic pathways.
  Dotted rectangles with rounded corners represent the metabolic pathways
