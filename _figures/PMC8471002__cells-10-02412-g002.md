caption: Molecular mechanism of p38 MAPK-mediated pro-fibrotic signaling. The p38
  pathway is a critical positive regulator of myocardial fibrosis. At the receptor
  level, p38 signaling is activated by a variety of stimuli, including Ang II (AT1R),
  mechanical sensing (integrins), and inflammatory cytokines (TGF-βR, TLR4). These
  membrane-proximal events lead to the activation of MKK3/6, the specific upstream
  activator of the p38 MAPK kinases. Once activated, p38 crosstalk with IKK-NFkB signaling
  and Hippo effector YAP to mediate the pro-fibrotic (Col-1, Col-3, FN, and α-SMA)
  and pro-inflammatory (Il-1b, IL-6, TNF-α) gene programs. Ang II = Angiotensin II;
  α-SMA = Alpha-smooth muscle actin; AT1R = Angiotensin II receptor; Col = Collagen;
  ECM = Extracellular Matrix; FAK = Focal adhesion kinase; GBR2 = Growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2; IKK = IκB kinase; IL = Interleukin; ILK = Integrin-linked kinase; IRAK4
  = Interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1; MKK = Mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase; MyD88 = Myeloid differentiation factor 88; NFkB = Nuclear factor κ B; RhoA
  = Ras homolog family member A; Shc = SH2-containing collagen-related proteins; SOS
