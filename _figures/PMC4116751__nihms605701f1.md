  description: The ligand, its receptor, and core signal transducers are indicated.
    LIN-3 encodes the worm epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand and is secreted from
    the gonadal anchor cell. It binds to its receptor LET-23 on the vulval precursor
    cells which then dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation (; ). SEM-5, an adaptor

    exchange factor (GEF) that activates LET-60, a Ras GTPase. KSR-1, a putative scaffold
    protein, is required for robust activation of LET-60 downstream signaling (; ).
    LET-60 activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, including
    LIN-45 (Raf), MEK-2 (MAPK kinase) and MPK-1 (MAPK) (; ; ; ; ; ; ). Activated MPK-1
    inhibits LIN-1, a transcription factor forming a complex with LIN-31. Upon LIN-1
