caption: 'Scheme depicting the possible mechanism of VEGFR-2-mediated vascular effects
  (cell proliferation, survival, migration, and enhanced permeability) related to
  vascular formation. VEGFR-2 is composed of an extracellular domain containing seven
  immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain
  of two kinase domains separated by a kinase-insert domain. The binding of the VEGF
  dimer to the receptor leads to the dimerization and autophosphorylation of specific
  intracellular tyrosine residues of the receptors. The phosphorylation of Y1175 recruits
  PLCγ, resulting in DAG release and activation of PKC and the Raf-MEK-ERK 1/2 signaling
  pathway and thus in stimulated cell proliferation. The phosphorylated Y1175 may
  also recruit adaptor protein Shb, which leads to activation of PI3K-PKB signaling;
  consequently, BAD and caspase are suppressed, which results in increased cell survival.
  Increased PI3K-PKB activity increases eNOS-dependent NO production, resulting in
  increased cell permeability, which facilitates angiogenesis through providing a
  proangiogenic extracellular environment. The phosphorylation of Y951 provides a
  binding site for TSAd, which causes the activation of Src, leading to increased
  cell migration and permeability. Increased cell migration also results from activation
  of Cdc42-p38 MAPK as a result of the phosphorylation of Y1214 and the formation
  of the Nck-Fyn complex. Solid arrows indicate activation and dashed arrows inhibition.
