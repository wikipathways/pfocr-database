caption: The sAC is abundant in kidney intercalated cells (ICs; an A-type acid secreting
  cell is illustrated here), where it colocalizes extensively with the V-ATPase. sAC
  generates cAMP in response to an increase in intracellular HCO3−, a process that
  is enhanced by a parallel increase in Ca2+. This cAMP signal results in an accumulation
  of V-ATPase (shown as ball and stalk-like structures here) at the apical surface
  of A-ICs, possibly upon phosphorylation (P) of one or more subunits of the V-ATPase.
  This apical accumulation could occur by increased exocytosis of V-ATPase–containing
  vesicles, and/or reduced endocytosis of the V-ATPase. The increased [HCO3−] in the
  cell could result from an increase in luminal HCO3− due to, for example, defective
  proximal tubule reabsorption (e.g., renal Fanconi syndrome) that leads to metabolic
  acidosis. Activation of ICs by increasing apical V-ATPase is a homeostatic mechanism
  to correct this acidosis. One proposed apical entry pathway for luminal HCO3− in
  ICs is the sodium/bicarbonate co-transporter NBC3. Increased intracellular [HCO3−]
  might also result from increased basolateral CO2, which is converted to HCO3− and
  H+ by cytosolic CAII, which is abundant in ICs. Indeed, an increase in basolateral
  CO2 stimulates apical proton secretion by A-ICs. A remaining puzzle is how A-type
  (acid-secreting) and B-type (bicarbonate-secreting) ICs differentially respond to
  variations in systemic acid/base levels to modulate V-ATPase trafficking into and
  out of their apical and basolateral membranes, respectively. PC, principal cell.
