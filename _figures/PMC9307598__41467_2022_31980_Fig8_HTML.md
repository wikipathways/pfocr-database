caption: a A diagram illustrating the functions of the identified CSA genes except
  for CSA6 in various phases and phase transitions of the cell cycle. b Schematic
  depicting the approximate position of Csa6 with respect to SPB and KT. In C. albicans,
  SPBs and clustered KTs remain in close proximity throughout the cell cycle, while
  Csa6 remains constitutively localized to the SPBs. c A model summarizing the effects
  of overexpression or depletion of Csa6 in C. albicans. A wild-type cell with unperturbed
  Csa6 levels progresses through the mitotic cell cycle. Overexpression of CSA6 alters
  the mitotic spindle dynamics, which might lead to improper KT-MT attachments, prompting
  SAC activation and G2/M arrest. In contrast, decreased levels of Csa6 inhibit the
  MEN signaling pathway, probably by affecting Tem1 recruitment to the SPBs, resulting
  in cell cycle arrest at the late anaphase/telophase stage.
