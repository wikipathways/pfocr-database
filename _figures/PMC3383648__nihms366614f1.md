caption: The Hedgehog pathway is normally regulated through a cascade of primarily
  inhibitory signals. Any of 3 mammalian Hedgehog (Hh) ligands (Sonic, Indian, or
  Desert Hedgehog) bind to cell surface PTCH1. Ligand binding to PTCH1 relieves PTCH1
  inhibition of the critical activator of Hedgehog signaling, SMO. PTCH1 deficiency,
  found in the majority of BCC and about 30% of medulloblastoma, is associated with
  constitutive, ligand-independent activation of SMO. In mammalian cells, derepression
  of SMO is associated with its translocation from internal vesicles to the cell membrane
  cilium (not shown). Active SMO signals downstream through an intermediary Sufu,
  promoting the release of Gli family transcription factors which can then translocate
  to the nucleus to affect gene transcription. There are multiple Gli proteins whose
  functions are somewhat cell type dependent; in general, Gli2 appears to be a particularly
  strong activator of downstream gene transcription (along with Gli1), while Gli3
  is in most contexts inhibitory. Pathway activation and release from Sufu can lead
  to proteosomal degradation of Gli3, and to preferential nuclear translocation of
  Gli1 and Gli2, which activate transcription of multiple target genes, including
  key regulators of the Hedgehog pathway, notably Gli1 and PTCH1. Vismodegib binds
  to the extracellular domain of SMO, markedly inhibiting downstream signaling, even
  in the absence of PTCH1. The first documented mechanism of clinical acquired resistance
  to vismodegib is a secondary mutation in the extracellular domain of SMO, D473H
  (indicated in the inset as a red circle), which prevents vismodegib binding.
