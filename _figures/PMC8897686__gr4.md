caption: Schematic pathway diagram depicting the significantly influenced precursors
  of central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle)
  and interrelated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway of K. pneumoniae FADDI-KP001 due
  to polymyxin B (PMB), caspofungin (CSP) monotherapies and their combination at 1 h
  (≥-1.0-log2-fold, p ≤ 0.05). Blue rectangles represent the supressed metabolites.
