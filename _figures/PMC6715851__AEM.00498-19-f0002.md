  nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor (TAG accumulation) conditions. The network representation

  measurements, and 13C isotope fractionation approaches) in R. jostii RHA1 and R.
  opacus PD630 as models of oleaginous rhodococci. Arrows indicate the physiological
  directions of reactions. The intensity of the metabolic flow is represented by the
  thickness of the black arrows. Metabolic pathways are shown in boxes, and the occurrence
  of a higher or lower predominance is represented by combining the box and the font
  sizes. Thick violet arrows represent signal inputs or effectors of regulatory proteins.
