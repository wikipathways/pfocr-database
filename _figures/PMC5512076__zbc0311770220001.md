caption: ADS lyase in the purine biosynthesis pathway. A, ADS lyase is responsible
  for the β-elimination of fumarate from the substrates SAICAR and ADS. B, β-elimination
  of fumarate from substrates SAICAR and adenylosuccinate by ADS lyase for the production
  of aminoimidazole-4-carboxamine ribonucleotide and AMP, respectively.
papertitle: Cryptococcus neoformans ADS lyase is an enzyme essential for virulence
  whose crystal structure reveals features exploitable in antifungal drug design.
