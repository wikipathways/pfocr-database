caption: 'The three major pathways of alcohol metabolism. The primary pathway is initiated
  by alcohol dehydrogenase, a NAD+ requiring enzyme expressed at high levels in hepatocytes,
  which oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde. The second major pathway, the microsomal
  ethanol oxidizing system pathway, involves the NADPH-requiring enzyme cytochrome
  P450 enzyme 2E1, which is induced by chronic alcohol exposure. The third pathway
  for ethanol metabolism is carried out by catalase, a peroxisomal enzyme. ADH: Alcohol
  dehydrogenase; ALDH2: Aldehyde dehydrogenase; CYP2E1: Cytochrome P450 enzyme 2E1;
  HNE: 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; LOOH: Lipid hydroperoxides; MDA: Malondialdehyde; MEOS:
  Microsomal ethanol oxidizing system; ROS: Reactive oxygen species.'
