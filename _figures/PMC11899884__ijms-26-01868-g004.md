caption: Modulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagy by NPs in cancer therapy.
  The dual function of nanoparticles (NPs) in modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
  pathway to regulate autophagy in cancer cells. Nanoparticles, including gold nanoparticles
  (AuNPs), silica nanoparticles (SiNPs), lipid-based nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles
  (IONPs), graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONPs), chitosan-based nanoparticles, and
  polymeric nanoparticles, impede the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, resulting in the induction
  of autophagy. This pathway promotes cancer cell death by elevating autophagic flux,
  oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Conversely, some nanoparticles, such as cerium
  oxide nanoparticles (CeONPs), silica-coated quantum dots, calcium phosphate nanoparticles
  (CaPNPs), and albumin-based nanoparticles stimulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, thereby
  suppressing autophagy. This inhibition diminishes autophagy-related cancer cell
  survival, hence augmenting the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic drugs. The figure
