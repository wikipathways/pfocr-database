caption: Non-genomic estrogen mediated mechanisms of VSM contraction. Agonists activate
  specific VSM receptors and stimulates PLC, and increases the production of IP3 and
  diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 stimulates Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
  (SR). Agonists also stimulate Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels. Ca2+ binds CAM,
  activates myosin light chain (MLC) kinase, causes MLC phosphorylation, and initiates
  VSM contraction. DAG causes activation of PKC, and PKC then phosphorylates calponin
  (CaP) and/or activate a protein kinase cascade involving Raf, MAPK kinase (MEK),
  and MAPK, leading to phosphorylation of caldesmon (CaD) and an increase in the myofilament
  force sensitivity to Ca2+. Estrogen binds to plasma membrane ER, leading to inhibition
  of agonist-activated mechanisms of VSM contraction. Possible nongenomic effects
  of estrogen include activation of K+ channels, leading to membrane hyperpolarization,
  inhibition of Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels, and thereby inhibition of Ca2+-dependent
  MLC phosphorylation and VSM contraction. Estrogen may also inhibit PKC and/or the
  MAPK pathway through activation of plasma membrane ERs and thereby further inhibit
  VSM contraction. Estrogen-induced NO release from the endothelium activates guanylate
  cyclase in VSM leading to increased cGMP and stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein
  kinase (PKG). PKG decreases [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ extrusion pumps in the plasma
  membrane and Ca2+ uptake pumps in SR and/or decrease the sensitivity of the contractile
  myofilaments to [Ca2+]i and thereby promote VSM relaxation. Estrogen also induces
  the release of PGI2 from the endothelium to activate the PGI2-cAMP pathway, or EDHF
  to activate Ca2+-activated K+ channels and to cause hyperpolarization and relaxation
  of VSM.

  description: Non-genomic estrogen mediated mechanisms of VSM contraction. Agonists
    activate specific VSM receptors and stimulates PLC, and increases the production
    of IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 stimulates Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic
    reticulum (SR). Agonists also stimulate Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels. Ca2+
    binds CAM, activates myosin light chain (MLC) kinase, causes MLC phosphorylation,
    and initiates VSM contraction. DAG causes activation of PKC, and PKC then phosphorylates
    calponin (CaP) and/or activate a protein kinase cascade involving Raf, MAPK kinase
    (MEK), and MAPK, leading to phosphorylation of caldesmon (CaD) and an increase
    in the myofilament force sensitivity to Ca2+. Estrogen binds to plasma membrane
    ER, leading to inhibition of agonist-activated mechanisms of VSM contraction.
    Possible nongenomic effects of estrogen include activation of K+ channels, leading
    to membrane hyperpolarization, inhibition of Ca2+ entry through Ca2+ channels,
    and thereby inhibition of Ca2+-dependent MLC phosphorylation and VSM contraction.
    Estrogen may also inhibit PKC and/or the MAPK pathway through activation of plasma
    membrane ERs and thereby further inhibit VSM contraction. Estrogen-induced NO
    release from the endothelium activates guanylate cyclase in VSM leading to increased
    cGMP and stimulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). PKG decreases [Ca2+]i
    by stimulating Ca2+ extrusion pumps in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ uptake pumps
    in SR and/or decrease the sensitivity of the contractile myofilaments to [Ca2+]i
    and thereby promote VSM relaxation. Estrogen also induces the release of PGI2
    from the endothelium to activate the PGI2-cAMP pathway, or EDHF to activate Ca2+-activated
