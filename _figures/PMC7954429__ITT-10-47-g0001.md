caption: 'Possible mechanisms through which sCD127 influences IL-7-induced effects
  on CD8+ T cells. Most evidence suggest sCD127 has an agonistic effect on IL-7-induced
  activity on CD8+ T cells. sCD127 was shown to influence IL-7-induced effect through:
  (1) competition with mCD127 for binding to IL-7 molecules; (2) while engaged to
  IL-7, inducing lower consumption of the cytokine, thus, increasing its bioactivity,
  (3) inhibition of the activity of negative regulators of IL-7/CD127 pathway (eg,
  SOCS, CD95), and (4) amplification of IL-7-induced CD8+ T cell proliferation and
  viability.'
