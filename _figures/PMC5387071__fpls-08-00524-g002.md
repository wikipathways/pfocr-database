caption: Nitric oxide (NO) and ABA signaling in seeds. (A) Indirect regulation of
  ABA INSENSITIVE5 (ABI5) expression by NO. The group VII ethylene response factors
  (ERFVIIs) induce expression of ABI5 through EBP-box cis-elements (EBPs) in its promoter
  region. NO promotes the N-end rule proteolysis pathway and degrade ERFVIIs, thereby
  reducing ABI5 expression. ABRE, ABA responsive element; PRT6, PROTEOLYSIS 6; ATE,
  arginyl-tRNA:protein arginyltransferase. Based on ,  and , ). (B) Direct regulation
  of ABI5 protein stability by NO. NO counteracts with ABA through the turnover of
  ABI5 and positively affects seed germination, which is mediated through S-nitrosylation.
  The thiol side chain (-SH) of the cysteine 153 (Cys153) of ABI5 (ABI5-SH) is subject
  to S-nitrosylation by NO, which can be provided by the endogenous donor S-nitrosoglutathione
  (GSNO). In this way, ABI5-SH is converted to ABI5 nitrosothiol (ABI5-SNO), which
  is destabilized through ubiquitination (ub) by the RING-type E3 ligase KEEP ON GOING
  (KEG) and degradation by the 26S proteasome pathway. This process reduces ABA signaling
  and positively affects seed germination and postgermination. In contrast, relatively
  high levels of ABA promote autophosphorylation of KEG by its own kinase domain (top-right),
  which destabilizes KEG through autoubiquitination and in turn stabilizes ABI5. ABI5
  can also be stabilized by sumoylation (s, top-left), which prevents ubiquitination,
  although it makes ABI5 inactive. When Cys 153 of ABI5 is substituted by Ser 153
  (bottom-left), ABI5 still functions normally, in terms of dimer formation and ABRE
  binding, however, ABI5 S-nitrosylation is abolished, which negatively affects germination
  and postgermination. Note that SNF1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2), which phosphorylates
  and activates ABI5, is also subject to S-nitrosylation (top-left). The endogenous
  NO scavenger hemoglobins (Hb) and the exogenous NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine
  (SNAP) and scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5 tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide
  (cPTIO) are also shown with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Based on , ), , , ,
