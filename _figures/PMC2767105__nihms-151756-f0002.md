caption: Intracellular ascorbate (Asc) modulates redox-sensitive signaling pathways
  in microvascular endothelial cells during sepsis. The largest rectangle represents
  a microvascular endothelial cell, in which arrows with solid lines indicate stimulation
  and those with dotted lines indicate inhibition. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines
  such as interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) stimulate signaling pathways that trigger the
  expression of NADPH oxidase (Nox) subunit p47phox, inducible nitric oxide synthase
  (iNOS), and other inflammatory mediators. Hypoxia increases hypoxia-inducible factor
  1 (HIF-1), by inhibiting HIF-1 prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD), and thereby induces the
  expression of sepsis-associated genes. Asc inhibits the activation of Jak2-Stat1-IRF1
  pathway and increases the activity of PHD. Asc further regulates local nitric oxide
  (NO) concentration by scavenging superoxide () and peroxynitrite (ONOO–). IKK; NFκB.
  Ascorbate does not affect the IKB kinase (IKK) and nuclear factor-κB that also mediate
  iNos induction in microvascular endothelial cells exposed to LPS and IFN gamma.
