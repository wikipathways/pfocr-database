caption: 'In response to ER stress, (1) the cellular levels of phytosphingosine (PHS)
  become elevated, initiating the hallmark events of the ERSU: (2) the initial ER
  tubule (IET) entry into the daughter cell is blocked and (3) the septin ring mislocalizes
  from the bud neck, ultimately, (4) resulting in cytokinesis cell cycle block. These
  events are mediated by the reticulon family proteins RTN1, RTN2, YOP1, and MAP kinase,
  SLT2, and SLT2’s upstream kinases such as PKC1. Levels of Rtn1 and Yop1 increase
  under ER stress. Currently, the detailed molecular mechanisms by which these components
  activate the ERSU hallmark events have not yet been investigated. Cytokinesis block
  continues until ER functional homeostasis is recovered by activation of the UPR,
  which is also activated by ER stress independent of the ERSU events. Upon recovery,
  ER inheritance and the cell cycle resume. Recent results revealed that septin ring
  mislocalization plays a critical role in timely re-entry into the cell cycle when
  ER functional homeostasis is re-established ().'
