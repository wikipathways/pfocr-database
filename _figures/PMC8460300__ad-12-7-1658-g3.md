caption: cGAS-STING signaling pathway in CNS disorders. cGAS-STING signaling pathway
  is involved in neuroinflammation in various CNS disorders such as ischemic stroke,
  SAH, TBI, AD, and PD. These markers are expressed predominantly in microglia and
  play different roles depending on the type of disease. This axis acts as a contributing
  factor to the production of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines and promotes
  microglial phagocytosis. It may also lead to secondary injury and aggravate the
  pathological progression of CNS disorders.
