caption: The proposed model for the regulation of the IRS-1-PI3K-mTOR pathway by PRCP
  and PREP. The IRS-1-PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway forms a signaling loop and regulates cell
  proliferation and survival. IRS-1 is negatively regulated by S6K and additional
  (unspecified) kinases by serine phosphorylation and consequent degradation. PRCP
  and PREP may inhibit the function of S6K and unspecified kinases by currently unknown
  mechanisms on serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, preventing degradation of IRS-1.
  Inhibition of PRCP and PREP may enable S6K and unspecified kinases to phosphorylate
  IRS-1 and facilitate its degradation, leading to down-regulation of PI3K activity.
  Rapamycin inhibits mTOR and S6K, leading to feedback stabilization and activation
  of IRS-1/PI3K/AKT in the presence of PRCP and PREP. When PRCP and PREP are depleted
  or inhibited, unspecified kinases are able to phosphorylate and degrade IRS-1 regardless
  of rapamycin. Therefore, rapamycin-mediated stabilization and activation of IRS-1
  and PI3K is blocked by depletion/inhibition of PRCP and PREP, leading to enhanced
  cytotoxicity.
