caption: The relationship between lipids and hedgehog signaling. a Regulation of canonical
  hedgehog signaling by lipids. Smoothened (SMO) is the nexus of hedgehog pathway
  regulation by lipids. Cholesterol, oxysterols, and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
  (PI(4)P) are SMO activators, whereas the plant sterol cyclopamine and a distinct
  class of B-ring oxysterols, DHCEO (7DHC, 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one) inhibit
  SMO. PTCH prevents activation of hedgehog signaling by restricting the access of
  cholesterol and PI(4)P to SMO while also inhibiting the synthesis of the latter
  lipid molecule. PI(4)P also prevents the entry of negative regulators of hedgehog
  signaling, TULP3 and GPR161, to the primary cilium. In hepatocytes, downstream of
  SMO full-length activated GLI was reported to repress the lipogenic transcriptional
  program (dashed inhibitory arrow) but the mechanism is unclear. GLIR GLI repressor,
  GLIFL full-length GLI. b Non-canonical signaling via AMPK in muscle and brown fat.
  AMPK is activated by SMO via liver kinase complex B1 (LKB1) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent
  kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2). In turn, adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) represses
  cholesterol production directly by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) and indirectly through mTORC1 inhibition.
  In this context cyclopamine was reported to act as a partial agonist of SMO, but
  whether cholesterol activates SMO has not been tested (question mark above arrow).
  Lipid/sterol molecules and lipogenic transcription factors are shown in red. Arrows
  indicate activation (arrowhead) or inhibition (orthogonal bars), except for the
  arrow from PI to PI(4)P, which indicates an enzymatic step
