caption: The canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways of the pyroptosis.
  In the canonical pathway, intracellular signaling molecules stimulate PAMPs and
  DAMPs, which activates caspase-1 and causes it to cleave GSDMD into GSDMD-N. GSDMD-N
  generates holes resulting in cell swelling, inflammatory mediators release, and
  pyroptosis. Inflammatory caspases are triggered in the non-canonical pathway by
  the caspase-4/5/11 binding to intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GSDMD is broken
  down into GSDMD-N by activated caspases, which binds to lipids in the plasma membrane
  to produce huge oligomeric holes that allow the discharge of cellular contents and
  cause cell death. Furthermore, GSDMD cleavage results in K+ efflux, which eventually
  facilitates the NLRP3 inflammasome assembed, IL-1β and IL-18 cleavaged.
