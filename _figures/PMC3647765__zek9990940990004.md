caption: C. neoformans reprogramming of carbon metabolism in response to phagocytosis
  by amoeba and macrophages. The metabolic pathway scheme shows the differential modulation
  of several transcripts of enzymes active in gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate cycle, and
  β-oxidation after C. neoformans internalization by amoebae (A) and macrophages (M).
