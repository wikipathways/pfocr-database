caption: Exosome’s contents, its formation, and its capture by the target cell are
  shown. Interestingly, although many exosomes do not enter the phagocytic pathway
  and degradation, some of them are release to the cytoplasm and are destroyed by
  lysosomal degradation. As shown in the figure, the exosomes bind and integrate by
  target cell in different ways
