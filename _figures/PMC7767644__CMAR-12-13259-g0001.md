caption: Autophagy is mediated by multiple signaling pathways that creating an interaction
  network system. Several signal molecules (PI3K/AKT pathway, MAPK pathway, TSC1/2
  and the p53 tumour suppressor) regulate the mTOR pathway and then regulate autophagy
  by interacting with the uncoordinated 51-like kinase-1 (ULK1) complex. Autophagy
  also responds to intracellular energy. The 5′-adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) which is upregulated by increasing AMP levels inactivates
  mTORC1 and activates ULK1. Autophagy is also regulated by the Beclin1 complex. Bcl-2,
  a key regulator of apoptosis, which binds and interacts with beclin1 to inhibits
  the occurrence of autophagy. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and FOXO transcription
  factor also participate in the regulation of autophagy.
