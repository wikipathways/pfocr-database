caption: A GeneGO pathway map is shown to illustrate the interactions between the
  selected proteins. The results of LC-MRM screens used to select peptide candidates
  for quantitative assay development are shown for four selected proteins, β-catenin,
  c-Src, c-Myc, and the catalytic subunit of PP2A. Each extracted ion chromatogram
  plot shows peptide signal over time. Using these data, one peptide standard is developed
  for quantification, but all peptides detected in these screens are monitored in
  biological experiments. The Roman numerals link to the peptide sequences listed
  in .
