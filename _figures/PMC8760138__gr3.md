caption: Chloroplast ORS pathways.(A) βCC-mediated ORS. High-light stress leads to
  a burst of 1O2 in PSII enriched in the grana core, resulting in the accumulation
  of oxidized β-carotene-derived volatile products such as βCC. βCC induces detoxification
  genes via the GRAS protein SCL14 and TGAII transcription factors. βCC also induces
  the ICS1 gene, encoding a key SA synthesis enzyme. The increased SA level then evokes
  SA-responsive genes through the SA receptor NPR1 and TGAII transcription factors.
  βCC also inhibits DXS, the rate-limiting enzyme in the MEP pathway.(B) PAP- and
  MEcPP-mediated ORS pathways. Environmental factors, such as high light and drought,
  increase O2− and H2O2 levels in PSI, changing the chloroplast redox status. Such
  oxidative stress inactivates SAL1 phosphatase and HDS in the MEP pathway, resulting
  in PAP and MEcPP accumulation, respectively. PAP then mediates an ORS to induce
  plastid redox-associated genes by blocking the RNA-degrading activity of XRNs in
  the nucleus. Like PAP, MEcPP migrates to the nucleus to evoke the expression of
  stress-responsive genes in a Ca2+- and CAMTA3-dependent manner. The activation of
  CAMAT3 by MEcPP stabilizes the red-light photoreceptor PhyB with concurrent reductions
  in ethylene and auxin. MEcPP also elicits SA- and JA-responsive genes to modulate
  plant stress responses.(C) EX1-mediated ORS in the grana margin. The 1O2-dependent
  oxidation of the Trp643 residue (Trp643oxi) in EX1 leads to FtsH2-dependent EX1
  proteolysis, eliciting ORS. Another chloroplast protein, SAFE1, protects grana margin
  proteins from 1O2. The loss of SAFE1 induces EX1-independent 1O2-responsive genes
  (SORGs).(D)1O2 generation by tetrapyrrole intermediates. The tetrapyrrole biosynthesis
  (TPB) pathways are divided into Chl and heme branches. In the Chl branch, MAGNESIUM
  CHELATASE (MgCh) inserts Mg2+, whereas in the heme branch, FERROCHELATASE (FeCh)
  inserts Fe2+. Most of the free tetrapyrrole intermediates containing the macrocycle
  structure can act as photosensitizers upon exposure to light, thereby generating
  1O2. In the dark, the FLU protein negatively regulates the accumulation of Pchlide
  by repressing the synthesis of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), the universal precursor
  of TPB.(E) Lipid peroxidation-dependent 1O2signaling. LOX-mediated oxidation of
  PUFAs (LH) generates lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH). LOOH can be reduced to lipid alkoxyl
  radical (LO•) in the presence of transition metals. Further reduction of LO• produces
  lipid radical (L•) and lipid hydroxide (LOH). Under oxidation-prone conditions,
  LOOH is oxidized into LOO•, which spontaneously forms high-energy intermediates
  such as cyclic endoperoxide (LOOL) and linear tetroxide (LOOOOL). Both LOO• and
  LOOOOL may directly generate triplet ketones (3L=O) or 1O2 through disproportionation
  reactions based on the Russell mechanism (). The thermal cleavage of LOOL is also
  known as the source of 3L=O. As an excited-state carbonyl, 3L=O can transfer excitation
  energy to O2 and Chl to form 1O2 and 1Chl, respectively. GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
