caption: 13C and 2H distribution from labeled glucose in glycolysis and Krebs cycle.
  (A,B) 13C-glucose is decarboxylated at different steps in the Krebs cycle and oxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway. Colored circles indicate 13C label for selected metabolic
  intermediates. [2-13C]glucose and [3-13C]glucose are associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) activity producing m+2 and m+3 acetyl-CoA, respectively. Using [1,2-13C]glucose
  allows to distinguish between glycolysis and oxidative pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) flux. (C) [3-2H]glucose enters the PPP via glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and decarboxylated
  to ribulose 5-phosphate (R5P), which generates 2H-NADPH. DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; IDH, isocitrate
  dehydrogenase; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; α-KGDH, α-Ketoglutarate dehydrogenase; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
  2PG, 2-Phosphoglycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; R5P, ribulose 5-phosphate.
