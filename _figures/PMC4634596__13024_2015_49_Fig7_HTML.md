caption: Schematic representation showing the proposed pathway that mediates dendritic
  simplification. The formation of Aβ and NMDAR activity are required for dendritic
  simplification since blocking of Aβ production or inhibition of NMDAR activity abolish
  the pathology. NMDAR activation leads to pathologic dephosphorylation of dendritic
  tau, which shows at physiological conditions a higher phosphorylation state. Dephoshorylation
  increases tau’s activity to stabilize dendritic microtubules, an activity that is
  mimicked by the microtubule-stabilizing drug EpoD or phosphoblocking tau (Ala htau).
  Continuous lines show direct effects, and dashed lines show indirect effects with
  potential intermediate steps
