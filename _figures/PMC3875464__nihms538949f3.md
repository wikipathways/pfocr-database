caption: Schematic of PKG regulation of TRPC current and signaling. Stretch, and Gaq/11
  coupled activation (the latter via direct DAG stimulation, or indirectly via IP3
  depletion of intracellular stores) activates the TRPC channel (TRPC1, 3, 6); many
  likely combining different isoforms into a heterotetramer. The resulting cation
  entry stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) activation of calcineurin (Cn). Cn dephosphorylates
  NFAT, sending it to the nucleus where it can modify gene transcription. TRPC1, 3,
  6 are sensitive to NFAT and are upregulated in this process. PKG can be activated
  by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway or natriuretic peptide (NP) pathway, likely
  within different intracellular pools. PKG in turn phosphorylates and activates RGS2/4
  protein that can suppress Gaq/11 and thus TRPC activation, but also directly phosphorylates
  TRPC6 (and TRPC3) to inhibit channel conductance. This in turn blocks the positive
  NFAT feedback loop.
