caption: The roles of circRNAs involving interaction with RBPs or other proteins in
  GC. A. The circular RNA hsa_circ_0006156 (circFNDC3B) interacts with IGF2BP3 in
  GC cells, leading to increased stability of CD44 mRNA, which ultimately promotes
  the migration and invasion of GC. B. Hsa_circ_0008494 (circARID1A) interacts with
  IGF2BP3 in GC cells to form an hsa_circ_0008494–IGF2BP3–SLC7A5 ternary complex that
  enhances the expression of SLC7A5 and ultimately, promotes GC proliferation. C.
  Hsa_circ_0135889 (circAGO2) interacts with HuR, inhibiting the function of the AGO2–miRNA
  complex, which leads to the upregulation of downstream target genes and promotes
  proliferation and metastasis of GC. D. CircSLC4A7 interacts with HSP90 and activates
  the Notch1 signaling pathway to promote the proliferation and metastasis of GC.
  E. Hsa_circ_0000711 (circNFATC3) binds to and prevents the degradation of IGF2BP3
  to promote the proliferation of GC. F. Hsa_circRNA_102415 interacts with and promotes
  the degradation of PCBP1, which inhibits GPX1 expression and finally promotes the
  proliferation and metastasis of GC cells by activating AKT/GSK3β/EMT signaling.
  G. Hsa_circ_0049027 (circHuR) interacts with the transcription factor CNBP to repress
  HuR expression, which inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of GC. H. Circ_CEA
  serves as a “scaffold” facilitating the interaction between CDK and P53, which promotes
  the phosphorylation of P53 protein and the downregulation of downstream genes. Eventually,
  the apoptosis of GC cells is inhibited
