caption: 'Overlapping Alzheimer-related protein association network of AD-iPS5 neurons
  and of AD-iPS26B neurons. Protein association network of genes down-regulated in
  both AD-iPS5 neurons vs. H9 neurons and in AD-iPS26B neurons vs. H9 neurons comparisons
  of one neuronal differentiation. Protein interaction network retrieved from STRING
  v9 using genes from the Alzheimer disease pathway down-regulated in AD-iPS5 vs.
  H9 neurons and in AD-iPS26B vs. H9 neurons experiments. The network circles represent
  proteins. The lines between the circles show the functional association. Co-expression
  evidence: black, database evidence: light blue, textmining evidence: yellow, experimental
  evidence: purple, co-occurrence evidence: blue, neighborhood evidence: green, fusion
  evidence: red.'
