caption: 'Workflow of gene-level and pathway-level models. Gene-level data matrix
  of GE/SPM/CNV is input into the workflow. Genes are pre-filtered either by intersecting
  with the pathway collection (shown as ‘Path’) or further filtering the genes by
  intersecting with COSMIC genes (shown as ‘COSMIC’) or significant genes (p-value
  less than 0.05) in univariable Cox models (shown as ‘Cox’). Then, for the pathway-level
  models, gene set enrichment is conducted to transform the gene-level matrix into
  a pathway-level matrix. For GE and CNV data, GSVA is applied and for SPM, odds ratio
  is applied to conduct gene set enrichment. While for the gene-level models, this
  step is skipped. With the filtered gene-level data matrix or the transformed pathway-level
  data matrix as the predictor matrix, we conducted nested cross validation to test
  the predictive performance of gene-level and pathway-level models. A 5-fold cross
  validation separates the data into training and test sets. In the training set,
  a Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) or L1-penalized Cox model
  is fit with the shrinkage parameter chosen by a nested 10-fold cross validation.
  With the selected predictors and coefficient estimates, the estimated model is applied
  to the test set and three metrics are adopted to measure the prediction: i) the
  predictive performance is measured by the concordance index, ii) the model robustness
  is measured by Fleiss Kappa, iii) the model parsimony is measured by average model
  size'
