caption: 1) Following viral detection by PRRs and the activation of signaling pathways
  such as those described above, type I IFNs are produced []. The IFNB1 transcript
  is m6A modified, and m6A recruits the reader protein YTHDF2 to facilitate IFNB1
  degradation, dampening the production of IFN-β [, ]. 2) IFN-β activates signaling
  through the JAK-STAT pathway, activating JAK1 and TYK2 kinases, which phosphorylate
  STAT1 and STAT2, which associate with IRF9, forming a transcription factor complex
  that drives the transcription of ISGs []. Many ISGs are m6A-modified, and m6A enhances
  the translation of a subset of these ISGs. This translation enhancement by m6A and
  reader proteins like YTHDF1 promotes the antiviral effects of the type I IFN response
  []. Proteins whose expression are known to be regulated by m6A or m6A-related enzymes
  are shown in red text.
