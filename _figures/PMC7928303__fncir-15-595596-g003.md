caption: Hypothetical models for the regulation of synapse-organizing proteins by
  glypicans. (A) Fine structures of HS generated during biosynthetic processes may
  regulate the affinity strength between the synapse-organizing proteins affecting
  their signal strengths. (B) Extracellular regulation of HS structures by heparanase
  and 6-O endosulfatase (Sulf). Fragmentation of HS by heparanase and 6-O desulfation
  by Sulf may turn the signal off and change the signal strength of synapse-organizing
  proteins, respectively. (C) Effects of the glypican shedding on the synapse-organizing
  proteins. Shed glypicans may not activate synapse-organizing proteins (α pathway),
  but instead activate an alternative signaling pathway (β pathway).
