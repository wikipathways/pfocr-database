caption: 'Nerves promote tumour cell growth and survival The neural impact on tumors
  is mediated through sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory nerves, as indicated
  by solid lines in the diagram. Black lines with arrows signify activation, whereas
  red lines with dashes indicate inhibition. Cholinergic nerves activate ERK1/2 and
  AKT signaling molecules via M3 cholinergic receptors mediated by EGFR, and inhibition
  of pancreatic EGFR/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways is achieved through M1.
  Sympathetic nerves, by releasing catecholamines, activate β2-adrenergic receptors
  (ADRB2) on tumor cells, subsequently stimulating PKA and ERK pathways. This promotes
  tumor cell proliferation and transformation and induces the secretion of NGF or
  BDNF. Neurotrophic factors bind to Trk receptors on peripheral nerve endings, promoting
  neuronal growth and branching. BDNF, through its interaction with TrkB receptors
  on tumor cells, activates MAP kinase and Akt pathways, enhancing tumor cell survival
  and proliferation. Dopamine from nerves synergizes with EGFR to activate the ERK
  pathway, thereby facilitating cell cycle progression and cell survival. Serine and
  glutamate from nerves assist in tumor cell glycolysis, protein synthesis, and maintaining
  mitochondrial activity. Abbreviations : Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor(EGFR),
  β2-Adrenergic Receptors(ADRB2), Nerve Growth Factor(NGF), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
  Factor(BDNF), Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M1(M1), Muscarinic Acetylcholine
