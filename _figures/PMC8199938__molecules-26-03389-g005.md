caption: 'Putative collaborations between sex hormone-dependent cancers and the ECS
  (endocannabinoid system). The production of ECs is carried out by the actions of
  specific enzymes (light yellow boxes and broad blue arrows). These actions are supported
  by the enzymatic hydrolysis of NArPE lipid precursors, particularly associated with
  the membrane. Both sex steroid hormones perform theoretical roles in the pathway.
  Both hormones, such as progesterone (represented as P4 at each corner in the circle
  filled with light blue color) and oestradiol (represented as E2 at each corner in
  the circle filled with light blue color). 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide
  (N-arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA) are known as classical ECs. The non-classical
  ECs are recognized as PEA and OEA. Both forms of ECs (i.e., classical and non-classical)
  bind independently or in concert at receptors CB1, CB2, and GPR55. Receptors PPAR
  and TRPV1 (represented in gold cold fill boxes) involve in the anticancer mechanism.
  Green boxes show the important activities linked to the anticancer mechanism in
  the center of the figure. There are speculated observations; either all these activities
  are interconnected or perform functions independently. Although this mechanism significantly
  reduced the mass of cancer cells. The ECS and its adjusting boundaries with sex
  steroid hormones are represented in the anticancer mechanisms, though theoretical
  or unidentified associations are specified using a question mark(s). ↑ ↓ Arrows
  illustrated the increasing or decreasing activity of a particular anticancer mechanism.
