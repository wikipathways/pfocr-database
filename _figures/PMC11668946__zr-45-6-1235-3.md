caption: 'AA participates in the deacylation/reacylation cycle of membrane phospholipidscPLA2α
  cleaves glycerophospholipid molecules at the sn-2 position to produce AA. Free AA
  can be converted to AA-CoA through ACSL4 and immediately re-acylated into membrane
  phospholipids through LPCAT3. Conversely, bioactive eicosanoids such as leukotrienes
  (LTs) and prostaglandins (PGs) are synthesized through the lipoxygenase (LOX) and
  cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways, which participate in the inflammatory response. (Created

  lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3. AA-CoA: arachidonoyl-CoA'
