caption: Differential TLR-mediated xenophagy in A. japonicus after V. splendidus and
  E. coli infection. The exposure of coelomocyte to LPSV. splendidus and LPSE. coli
  were mediated by AjTLR3 and AjToll, respectively. Activated AjTLR3 and AjToll both
  promoted AjTRAF6 ubiquitination, which further increased the K63-linked ubiquitination
  of AjBeclin1 and triggered the formation of autophagosomes. Inconsistently, the
  engagement of AjTLR3 also triggered a signaling pathway that led to the expression
  of AjA20. The increased abundance of AjA20 might limit AjTLR3-induced autophagy
  through the deubiquitination of AjBeclin1. The precise mechanism of A20 and deubiquitination
  should be verified in future studies. The yellow solid line indicates E. coli-induced
  autophagy based on the AjToll signaling pathway; the green solid and imaginary lines
  indicate V. splendidus-induced autophagy based on the AjTLR3 signaling pathway;
  the red solid line indicates the common xenophagy processes in both V. splendidus-
  and E. coli-induced autophagy.
