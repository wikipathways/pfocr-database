caption: 'Pathways of apoptosis. Depiction of the cascades of apoptosis. Diverse internal
  and external stimuli causing persistent damage signaling, such as DNA damage, cellular
  stress, telomere shortening, ionizing radiation, mitochondrial dysfunction, heat,
  hypoxia, may trigger the process of apoptosis via the perforin/granzyme (A), extrinsic
  (B) or intrinsic/mitochondrial (C) pathway. The aforementioned processes activate
  the final step of apoptosis, named the executive pathway of apoptosis (D). During
  these procedures, initiators (caspases 8, 9, 10) and effectors caspases (caspases
  3, 6, 7) are key players in the degradation of critical cell structures until the
  phagocytosis of the apoptotic cell. Under physiological conditions, p53 activity
  is controlled by MGM2; in the case of severe permanent damage, signaling p53 is
  upregulated and triggers the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Abbreviations:
  FADD: Fas-associated protein with death domain; TRADD: tumor necrosis factor receptor
  type1-associated death domain protein; MGM2: mouse double minute 2; Apaf-1: apoptotic
  protease-activating factor 1; TNFa: tumor necrosis factor alpha; TNF-R: tumor necrosis
  factor alpha receptor. Common ligand bindings of the extrinsic pathway are TNFa/TNF-Rs,
  ApoLs/DRs, TRAIL/TRAIL-Rs, FasL-Fas-R. Known proapoptotic proteins: Bcl-10, Bax,
  Bak, Bad; antiapoptotic proteins: Bcl-2, Bcl-x, BAG.'
