caption: Schematic overview of the major sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  in the cell and the corresponding inhibitors of those sites. The mitochondrial electron
  transport chain (ETC) complexes I, II and III generate ROS directly, whereas complex
  IV is the rate-determing step of the ETC. Other enzymes that produce ROS in the
  mitochondria are dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  2 (mGPDH or GPDH2) and monoamine oxidase (MAO). The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises
  several sites of ROS production, such as NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and the Ero1α-PDI
  oxidative protein folding pathway (Ero1α, ER oxidoreductin 1α; PDI, protein disulfide
  isomerase). Peroxisomes are another major source of cellular ROS production due
  to the activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2). Names of pharmaceutical
  and experimental inhibitors are presented and the corresponding target sites of
  ROS production are indicated by red lines.
