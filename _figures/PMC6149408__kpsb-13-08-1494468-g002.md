caption: 'Sucrose-induced stomatal closure representation.The upper figure shows a
  leaf transversal section demonstrating how the sucrose derived from photosynthetic
  activity of mesophyll cells can reach stomata apoplastic space via the transpiration
  stream., The lower figure, which is an augment of the stomata of the leaf transversal
  section, highlight two hypothesis regarding the mechanisms by which mesophyll-derived
  sucrose could induces stomatal closure. The first hypothesis, exemplified at the
  left guard cell of the stomata, suggest that the overaccumulation of sucrose in
  the apoplastic space would have an osmolytic effect in which the water potential
  (Ψw) of the apoplast would be reduced and become lower than the cytosolic Ψw leading
  to the efflux of water from guard cells and consequently stomatal closure., Alternatively,
  as demonstrated in the right guard cell of the stomata, sucrose would have a non-osmolytic
  role during stomatal closure., This hypothesis suggest that sucrose is degraded
  by invertase (INV) and sucrose synthase (SuSy) within guard cells and induces stomatal
  closure in a mechanism dependent of hexokinase (HXK) and mediated by abscisic acid
  (ABA). It remains unclear whether sucrose is degraded by apoplastic INV, which enable
  hexose to enter guard cells through hexose transporters, as well as whether this
  HXK and ABA signalling pathway induces ion efflux from guard cells. Although the
  hypotheses of sucrose-induced stomatal closure are discussed separately, it is noteworthy
  that they do not exclude each other and thus can occur simultaneously. Abbreviations:
  Suc, sucrose. Ions in the right guard cell: K+, potassium; Cl−, chloride; NO3−,
  nitrate; Mal−, malate.'
