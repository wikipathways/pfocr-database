caption: Complex biological processes of luminal B and basal-like subtype. We mapped
  the genes and miRNAs obtained from luminal B's module and basal-like's module to
  an integrated gene regulation network. The network was obtained through integrating
  three databases including Reactom, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and
  Nci-PID Pathway Interaction Database. The interactions between genes and miRNAs
  were obtained from miRTarBase. The size of the node is proportional to the size
  of the degree. The thickness of the edges indicates the strength of the regulatory
  relationship expressed by the Pearson correlation coefficient between microRNA and
  gene.
