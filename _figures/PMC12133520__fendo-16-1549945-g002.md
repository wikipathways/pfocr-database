caption: Thymus cell development and regulation mechanism. Thymocyte development and
  T cell lineage commitment in the thymus. The figure illustrates the progression
  of thymocyte differentiation from early thymic progenitors (ETP/DN1) through distinct
  double-negative (DN) stages to double-positive (DP) thymocytes. The β-selection
  checkpoint marks the transition from DN3 to DN4, driven by pre-TCR signaling and
  Notch activation, ensuring T cell survival, proliferation, and allelic exclusion
  of TCR β-chain. Post β-selection, thymocytes undergo positive and negative selection
  in the thymic cortex and medulla, leading to lineage commitment into CD4+ or CD8+
  single-positive (SP) T cells. Additionally, the figure highlights the potential
  differentiation into γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells, or other lineages under
  the influence of transcription factors like GATA-3, Id2, and Bcl11b. This pathway
  underscores the intricate regulatory mechanisms guiding T cell fate decisions within
  the thymic microenvironment
