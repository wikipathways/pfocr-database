caption: Proposed functional roles for Ech and ferredoxin during growth of M. barkeri
  on various substrates. Models for growth on methanol plus H2/CO2 (A), acetate (B),
  H2/CO2 (C), and methanol (D) are shown. The methanogenic pathway is shown in blue,
  the energy-conserving electron transport chain in red, and biosynthetic pathway
  in purple. The steps catalyzed by Ech and ferredoxin-dependent enzymes are labeled
  in green. See text for detailed discussion.
