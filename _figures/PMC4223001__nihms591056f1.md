caption: YAP activity is regulated by phosphorylation, subcellular localization, and
  degradation. Membrane receptors receive intracellular cues and relay them to the
  sub-membrane compartment. At adherens junctions (I), E-cadherin transduces cell-cell
  contact information via α/β-catenin. Under conditions of high cell density, α-catenin
  forms a complex with phosphorylated YAP and 14-3-3 proteins, thereby sequestering
  YAP. Growth factor signaling through GPCRs (II) inhibit LATS phosphorylation of
  YAP through a mechanisms involving Rho GTPases and actin polymerization. The classic
  Hippos kinase cascade (III), containing the kinases MST1/2 (mammalian Hippo ortholog)
  and LATS1/2 (mammalian Warts), phosphorylates YAP to restrain its nuclear localization
  and transcriptional activity. The Hippo kinase cascade is regulated by NF2 through
  uncharacterized upstream receptors. LATS also phosphorylates AMOT, a YAP binding
  protein. Phosphorylated AMOT dissociates from F-actin and brings bound YAP into
  the cytoplasm, where the complex is degraded by the ubiquitin proteosome system
  via interaction with AIP4. YAP is also phosphorylated by YES/SRC (IV), under the
  control of uncharacterized upstream receptors. YAP is a transcriptional co-activator,
  and its nuclear entry is promoted by dephosphorylation by PP2A. Nuclear YAP promotes
  mitogenic and anti-apoptotic gene transcription, canonically through interaction
  with TEAD transcription factors. YAP also enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling through
  physical interactions with β-catenin. YAP transcriptional activity is terminated
  by phosphorylation by a nuclear kinase, possibly LATS1/2, leading to 14-3-3 protein
  binding and nuclear export.
