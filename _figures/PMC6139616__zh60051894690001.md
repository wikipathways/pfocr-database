caption: Schematic of hepatic lipid metabolic pathways investigated in this study.
  Protein kinase B/target of rapamycin/ribsosomal protein S6 (Akt/Tor/S6) pathway
  components are highlighted in green, key metabolic enzymes in blue and microRNAs
  are in purple. Circulating metabolites are highlighted in red, while metabolites
  present within the liver are highlighted in yellow. In all cases, bold letters indicate
  variables measured in this study. Established functional relationships between measured
  parameters are based on previous literature (, , ), and question mark symbols indicate
  predicted interactions. FFA, free fatty acid; srebp1c, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein 1c; fasn, fatty acid synthase; acly, ATP citrate lyase; cpt1a, carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase 1A; hmgcs, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase; lxr, liver X
  receptor; ugt1a3, UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A3; srebp2, sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein 2.
