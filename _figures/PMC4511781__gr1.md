caption: Schematic representation of insulin and IGF-1 signaling in gray mouse lemursIR
  and IGF-IR share a similar signaling pathway which invokes downstream changes in
  two main branches – the mitogenic pathway (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) and the metabolic pathway
  (PI3K/Akt). These act in a coordinated manner to regulate glucose, lipid, and protein
  metabolism. The targets that exhibited relative changes between control and torpid
  conditions in each tissue are boxed and the targets examined are highlighted in
  associated colors (targets depicted in gray were not examined in the present study).
  Arrowheads denote positive regulatory effects while blunt-ended lines denote negative
  regulatory effects. Shaded boxes designate the tissue-specific response observed
  in gray mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus, during torpor. Akt is also known as Protein
  Kinase B (PKB). IR, insulin receptor; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1; IRS1,
  insulin receptor substrate 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol
  triphosphate; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase-1; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; TSC, tuberous sclerosis protein;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; GβL, G-protein β-subunit-like protein; p70S6K,
  p70S6 kinase; RPS6, ribosomal protein S6; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase
