caption: IPA identified “LXR/RXR activation” as the canonical pathway in the ESPs
  of TC-1 cells with the highest predicted potential/significance affected by the
  treatment with caerin 1.9, predicted based on label-free quantitation. The up/downregulations
  of proteins induced by caerin 1.9 are indicated by nodes with a range of red and
  green intensities. The activation or inhibition of certain signalling was shown
  in orange or blue, respectively. Lines connecting the proteins represent known interactions,
  and arrows indicate the directions of up/downstream regulations.
