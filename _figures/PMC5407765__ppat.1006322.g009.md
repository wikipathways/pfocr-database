caption: In the CNS IL-33 is expressed by endothelial cells, astrocytes and prominently
  by oligodendrocytes. After PbA-infection, IL-33 induces IL-1β release by microglia,
  contributing to the high levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ production seen at an
  early stage of infection. The neuroinflammatory response induced by IL-33/ST2 pathway
  alters neuroblast proliferation, associated with neurogenesis impairment and cognitive
  defects. In addition, IL-1-β induced by microglia, in turns stimulates oligodendrocytes
  to produce high levels of IL-33, leading to an amplification loop. IL-33 overexpression
  by oligodendrocytes induced an inflammatory context which could affect the myelin
  structure, as reported after PbA-infection in WT mice [], and this could be responsible
  for some cognitive impairments. Furthermore, IL-33/ST2 pathway orchestrates CNS
  glial cell response at an early stage of PbA-infection, promoting CXCL9 and CXCL10
  production to recruit, in a second phase the ECM pathogenic CD8+ T cells in cerebral
  vessels.
