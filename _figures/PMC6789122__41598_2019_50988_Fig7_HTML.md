caption: Proposed model for the role of Rarα in adrenocortical development. (A) Rarα
  regulates the expression of genes involved in the regulation of Wnt non-canonical
  pathway (Wnt4, Tcf3, Lef1…), angiogenesis (Vegfa) and Extra Cellular Matrix integrity
  (Fibronectin1, Collagen 3α1…) contributing to the organization of the adrenal cortex.
  Wnt4 activated pathway contributes to the differentiation of ZG cells, Vegfa to
  normal angiogenesis and Fibronectin1 and Collagen 3α1 being components of the Extra
  Cellular Matrix. (B) Model in which a homeostatic equilibrium between Rarα, Wnt
  and Vegf signaling pathways is required for the normal development of the vasculature
  and Extra Cellular Matrix structure, leading to normal adrenal cortex organization.
