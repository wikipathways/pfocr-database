caption: Schematic model of the potential mechanism of KHSRP regulation in the metastasis
  of lung cancer. In this proposed model, KHSRP can interact with HNRNPC and form
  a complex, activating the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway and thus leading to the invasion
  and metastasis of lung cancer cells
papertitle: RNA-binding protein KHSRP promotes tumor growth and metastasis in non-small
  cell lung cancer.
