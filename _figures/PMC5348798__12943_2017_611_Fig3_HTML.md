caption: Cdk5 takes part in DDR through STAT3 pathway. In growing cancer cells, the
  constitutive activation of STAT3 via JAK-mediated phosphorylation on tyrosine 705
  allows the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of STAT3 and up-regulation of cyclin
  D1 gene and myc gene, leading to cell cycle activation and proliferation. When cells
  are treated with topoisomerase I inhibitor (a DNA damaging agent), the activation
  of STAT3 by JAK is inhibited, while the expression and activity of Cdk5 are increased
  in response to DNA damaging agent. Up-regulated Cdk5 associates with STAT3 and phosphorylates
  it on serine 727, leading to activation of STAT3. The activated STAT3 then translocates
  to nucleus and interacts with the promoter of Eme1 gene, promoting the rescue of
  broken replication forks caused by DNA damage
