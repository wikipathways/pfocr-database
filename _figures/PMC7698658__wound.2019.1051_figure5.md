caption: IPA regulatory network with the highest consistency score (6.414) in ASCs
  isolated from three patients (after RNA pooling) and stimulated with the PDGF2 peptide
  (1 μg/mL) compared with parallel controls untreated with PDGF2. The consistency
  score is a measurement used to describe the relationship among the observed expression
  profile and upstream and downstream regulatory effects. The values below the molecules
  correspond to log2-fold changes in expression and p-value. Negative and positive
  values indicate a decrease and an increase in expression, respectively. In the bottom
  panel, the arrow shows the activation or inhibition of a downstream effect. ASCs,
  adipose-derived stem cells; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
