caption: Regulation of AMPK on lipid metabolism in FLD. In the case of non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease caused by insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, obesity, high-fat
  diet and alcoholic fatty liver disease caused by alcohol, the related proteins in
  AMPK signaling pathway will be inhibited or promoted, resulting in increased lipid
  accumulation and decreased fatty acid oxidation. This was reversed when AMPK was
  treated with AMPK agonists. AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
  ribonucleotide; LKB1, Liver kinase B1; the auxiliary subunit STRAD, STE20 related
  adaptor protein, and MO25, Mouse protein 25; Sirt1, Silent mating type information
  regulation two homolog1; CPT1, carnitine acyltransferase one; PGC-1α, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator -1α; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;

  TSC2; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin1; ULK1, unc51 like kinase one; HMGR,
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HSL, Hormone-Sensitive triglyceride lipase;
