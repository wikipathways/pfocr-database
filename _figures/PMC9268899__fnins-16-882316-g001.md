caption: Summary of reactive astrocytes involved in pathogenic or risk gene variants
  of AD, ALS, and PD. Reactive astrocytes carrying APOE ε4 promote Aβ and pTau accumulation
  in both astrocytes and neurons. Reactive astrocytes with APOE ε4 allele secrete
  pro-inflammatory factors and damage BBB integrity by upregulating MMP9. Reactive
  astrocytes with SOD1 mutant increase glutamate secretion and hyperexcitability by
  dysregulated AMPAR, resulting in ER-mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress
  in MNs. α-synuclein accumulation and oxidative stress increase in neurons through
  damaged ER-mitochondria in reactive astrocytes with PRKN, PINK1, DJ-1, SNCA mutant,
  and autophagy-lysosomal dysfunctions were found in reactive astrocytes with LRRK2,
  GBA mutant. AD, Alzheimer’s disease; ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; PD, Parkinson’s
  disease; APOE, apolipoprotein E; SOD1, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 gene; LRRK2,
  Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene; SNCA, α-synuclein gene; PRKN, parkin gene; PINK1,
  PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 gene; GBA, glucocerebrosidase gene; MMP9, matrix
  metalloproteinase 9; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin
  pathway; SG, stress granules; AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic
  acid receptor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
