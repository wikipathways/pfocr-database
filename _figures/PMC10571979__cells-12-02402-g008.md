caption: Norrin signals through DVL1 to stimulate barrier properties. Previous studies
  revealed that VEGF-induces endothelial permeability and simultaneously promotes
  norrin signaling by inducing FZD4 co-receptor TSPAN12 migration to the plasma membrane.
  Norrin signals through DVL1 promoting the canonical pathway with β-catenin stabilization,
  likely through the closed confirmation of DVL1 involving intramolecular binding
  of DVL1 PDZ domain and DVL1 PDZ-BM. Data here reveal an additional non-canonical
  signaling pathway necessary for tight junction organization and induction of barrier
  properties involving the open conformation of DVL1 with its PDZ domain binding to
  claudin 5 PDZ-BM.
