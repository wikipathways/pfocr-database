caption: Schematic diagram of our model. During brain ischemia, the signaling pathway
  mediated by astrocytes (right) takes place immediately (<5 min), and then later,
  the left pathway will also be driven to cause Kv2.1 modulation. They both ultimately
  induce the increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level, followed by Kv2.1 modulation
  (dephosphorylation, dispersion, and activation). The text in the parentheses indicates
  the experimental supports of the signaling pathways. See Discussion for more detail.
