caption: A diagram showing the steps in the C4 NAD-malic enzyme-subtype pathway. In
  mesophyll (M) cells, PEP is carboxylated by PEPC using the CO2 group from bicarbonate
  (HCO3-), which was produced from the hydration of atmospheric CO2 by CA. The resulting
  OAA is transaminated to Asp by Asp aminotransferase (AST). In the mitochondria (blue
  oval) of BS cells, OAA is generated from Asp by a mitochondrial AST, and then reduced
  to malate by NAD-malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH). Malate is decarboxylated by NAD-malic
  enzyme (NAD-ME), and the released CO2 diffuses into the BS chloroplast (green oval),
  where it is fixed by the PCR cycle. The pyruvate resulting from the decarboxylation
  reaction is converted to alanine (Ala) by Ala aminotransferase (ALT) in the BS cytosol.
  The Ala is transaminated back to pyruvate by ALT activity in the M cytosol. PPDK
  activity in M chloroplasts converts pyruvate to PEP.
