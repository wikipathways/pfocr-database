caption: The concept of DDT induction combined with immune checkpoint inhibition.
  The paradigm is based on the administration of DNA-damaging drug to transiently
  activate the intrinsic mutagenic DDT pathway. Suboptimal doses of these compounds
  would activate error-prone DDT pathways (i.e., TLS) and increase random mutations.
  Providing that these mutations induce non-synonymous changes in coding genes, the
  newly formed peptides could be processed and presented by the MHC-I complex. Appearance
  of these neoantigens would occur in the absence of significant toxicity for immune
  cells.
