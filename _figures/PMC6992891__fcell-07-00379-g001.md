caption: Effect and regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during renal fibrosis. The
  NLRP3 inflammasome not only mediates the inflammatory response but is also associated
  with pyroptosis, mitochondrial regulation, and myofibroblast differentiation during
  renal fibrosis. Regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during renal fibrosis is mediated
  by the following pathways. (1) Microbial molecules or endogenous risk factors up-regulate
  the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18 through the NF-κB signaling pathway
  to induce events such as K+ efflux, the generation of ROS or lysosomal damage, and
  others. (2) This triggers the oligomerization and activation of NLRP3 and the recruitment
  of the adapter protein ASC and pro-caspase-1. Pro-caspase1 undergoes autoproteolytic
  cleavage into bioactive caspase-1, which in turn acts on pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18
  to produce IL-1β and IL-18 to mediate inflammation and pyroptosis. (3) TGF-β signaling
  participates in the transdifferentiation of myofibroblasts and the production of
  ECM. (4) The TGF-β/Smad pathway can stimulate the expression of NLRP3, which is
  also involved in TGF-β-mediated Smad2/3 phosphorylation. Thus, the interaction between
  the NF-κB/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β/IL-18 axis and the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway
  may form a pathogenic cycle that leads to the development of renal fibrosis. (5)
  Additionally, NLRP3 may damage mitochondrial morphology and induce mitochondrial
  ROS production, ultimately promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. (6) Autophagy
  can negatively regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome by decreasing the levels of ASC and
  the phosphorylation of the NLRP3 protein and by purging mitochondrial ROS.

  description: Effect and regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during renal fibrosis.
    The NLRP3 inflammasome not only mediates the inflammatory response but is also
    associated with pyroptosis, mitochondrial regulation, and myofibroblast differentiation
    during renal fibrosis. Regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during renal fibrosis
    is mediated by the following pathways. (1) Microbial molecules or endogenous risk
    factors up-regulate the expression of NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, and pro-IL-18 through
    the NF-κB signaling pathway to induce events such as K+ efflux, the generation
    of ROS or lysosomal damage, and others. (2) This triggers the oligomerization
    and activation of NLRP3 and the recruitment of the adapter protein ASC and pro-caspase-1.
    Pro-caspase1 undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage into bioactive caspase-1, which
    in turn acts on pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to produce IL-1β and IL-18 to mediate
    inflammation and pyroptosis. (3) TGF-β signaling participates in the transdifferentiation
    of myofibroblasts and the production of ECM. (4) The TGF-β/Smad pathway can stimulate
    the expression of NLRP3, which is also involved in TGF-β-mediated Smad2/3 phosphorylation.
    Thus, the interaction between the NF-κB/NLRP3/caspase-1/IL-1β/IL-18 axis and the
    TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway may form a pathogenic cycle that leads to the development
    of renal fibrosis. (5) Additionally, NLRP3 may damage mitochondrial morphology
    and induce mitochondrial ROS production, ultimately promoting NLRP3 inflammasome
