caption: We envisioned that the functional interaction between FASN-catalyzed endogenous
  fatty acid biogenesis and the BCL-2 family interaction network that controls the
  mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis might be the basis for the differential sensitivity
  to FASN inhibitors (FASNis). The BCL-2 family can be divided into three classes,
  namely the pro-apoptotic BAX/BAK proteins, the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, and
  the pro-survival proteins, the latter inhibiting the activity of the pro-apoptotic
  BCL-2 family members. Although historically those BH3-only proteins able to directly
  activate BAX/BAK have been termed either “activators” and those targeting pro-survival
  proteins to indirectly activate BAX/BAK have been called “sensitizers”, this strict
  categorization is no longer appropriate as some “sensitizers” can exhibit direct
  activation functions under certain circumstances. Thus, BH3-only proteins can be
  better distinguished by their ability to either directly bind and “activate” BAX/BAK
  or indirectly “derepress” pro-survival proteins (via hindering the ability of pro-survival
  proteins to sequester BH3-only proteins to stop them activating BAX/BAK or impeding
  the ability of pro-survival proteins to bind to activated BAX/BAK and prevent their
  homo-oligomerization). BAX/BAK activation ultimately controls mitochondrial outer
  membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which precedes the release of mitochondria-stored
  cytochrome c (Cyt c) into the cytosol to promote apoptosome formation, subsequent
  activation of effector caspases, and apoptosis. The balanced interactions within
  the BCL-2 family involving activation of BH3-only proteins and inhibition by pro-survival
  proteins lastly sets how close a cell is to the threshold or apoptosis, a property
  called “mitochondrial priming”. Lack or low levels of activating/de-repressing events
  upon exposure to FASNis might lead to a resistant or unprimed state. When FASN blockade
  drives a high mitochondrial priming, cancer cells might acquire a primed-for-death
  state in which they ensure their survival by becoming “addicted” to anti-apoptotic
  proteins sequestering pro-apoptotic members. Created with BioRender.com.
