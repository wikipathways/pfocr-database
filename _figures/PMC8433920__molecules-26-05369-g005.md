caption: Schematic diagram of CD-induced possible molecular mechanisms in different
  tumor cells. CD could block cell proliferation through inactivation of several oncogenic
  molecules, including dephosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
  PI3K, Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta
  1 (P70S6K), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), extracellular
  signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and src. Besides, CD could also arrest cell
  cycle either at G0/G1 or G2/M phase through inhibition of cyclins and cyclin-dependent
  kinases (CDKs), as well as induction of the CDK inhibitor, p21, p27, and p53, respectively.
  In addition, CD could increase sub-G1 population, which indicates DNA fragmentation
  related to cell apoptosis. CD can trigger cell death via autophagy and/or apoptosis.
  CD has been shown to be involved with H2A.X phosphorylation as well as cleavage
  of caspase-3, -8, -9, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) to induce intrinsic
  and extrinsic apoptosis. Moreover, CD could promote ROS overproduction, which may
  induce cytochrome c release from the mitochondria outer membrane. The anti-apoptotic
  proteins that CD could suppress are heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and B cell lymphoma
  2 (Bcl-2). The pro-apoptotic proteins that CD could stimulate are Bad and Bax. Accordingly,
  CD induces phosphorylation of C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, and 5’ AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK). JNK has been linked to ROS generation, which may cause a
  positive feedback loop to further activate JNK itself. Activation of p38 MAPK has
  been demonstrated to reduce Bcl-2 expression and trigger the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway. As a tumor suppressor, forkhead box O3 (foxo3a), foxo4 as well as p53 can
  be up-regulated by CD treatment. The induction of p53 by CD may cause CDK inhibitor
  p21 to impede cell cycle, or, on the other hand, induce Fas/caspase-8 and initiate
  extrinsic apoptotic cascade. CD could repress the polycomb repressive comb complex
  (PRC)2 by modulating enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and suppressor of zeste
  12 homolog (Suz12) as well as regulating histone demethylation to induce apoptosis.
  The inflammatory signalling pathway includes Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and NF-κB, which
  could be both inactivated by CD treatment. CD could abrogate hypoxia inducible factor
  (HIF) 1 and 2 expression. Additionally, the HIF-downstream molecules, such as cMyc,
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP2 and
  MMP9), could all be down-regulated by CD. Moreover, CD can induce cancer cell anoikis
  by dephosphorylation of the FAK pathway to abolish FAK-associated proteins, including
  vinculin, paxillin, vimentin, β-catenin, and src kinase. Rac1 and cdc42 protein
  expression are also down-regulated by CD.
