caption: Schematic representation of the pharmacological compounds (black boxes) that
  inhibit YAP and TAZ oncogenic function through targeting YAP and TAZ or the main
  proteins and pathways that influence YAP and TAZ in lung cancer. Honokiol reactivates
  LKB1 and inhibits the YAP/TAZ/β-catenin oncogenic pathway. Statins and norcantharidin
  (NCTD) inhibit the mevalonate pathway and the production of monounsaturated fatty
  acids—two biosynthetic pathways of lipids that are increased in tumorigenesis. Through
  the inhibition of these two pathways, statins and norcantharidin inhibit oncogenic
  YAP, TAZ, and β-catenin signaling. Statins also inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation
  and β-catenin activation and nuclear translocation. Rottlerin is a natural polyphenolic
  compound which inhibits oncogenic TAZ in lung. EGFR inhibitors are too many to be
  listed here, but they inhibit the EGFR receptors and their downstream effectors
  and their inhibition has a synergistic effect when combined with YAP inhibition
  mediated by Verteporfin. This latter impairs the binding of YAP with the oncogenic
  transcription factors TEADs. Black arrows indicate pharmacological activation of
  the targeted proteins or pathways. Black blunt lines indicate pharmacological inhibition
  of the targeted proteins or pathways. As in previous figures, lines or arrows in
  red indicate signals which eventually activate nuclear YAP/TAZ, while lines or arrows
  in blue indicate signals or proteins which eventually inhibit nuclear YAP/TAZ, through
  mechanisms either dependent on or independent of Hippo pathway core kinases. Dashed
  arrows indicate reciprocal crosstalk between receptors and their downstream transduction.
