caption: 'Fourteen of 16 differentially expressed genes are down-regulated. One gene
  ‘mDia’ has one family member up-regulated (DIAPH1) and one family member up-regulated

  font in blue boxes. Differentially expressed genes are indicated by red font in
  a green box. The fold change in expression is indicated numerically with the direction
  of change indicated by ‘D’ for down-regulated genes, ‘U’ for up-regulated genes,
