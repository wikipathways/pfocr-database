caption: In normal pregnancy, MSX1 and MSX2 act to repress WNT and β-catenin signaling
  and inhibit FGF synthesis in the uterine stroma, thereby suppressing stromal-epithelial
  cross-talk. In the absence of MSX1 and MSX2, FGFs are induced, activating the epithelial
  FGFR-ERK1/2 pathway, and promoting epithelial proliferation. Activated ERK1/2 then
  phosphorylates epithelial ESR1. This triggers transcriptional activation of ESR1
  and expression of its target genes, such as Muc-1, which prevent the functional
  transformation of the luminal epithelium to receptive state, blocking embryo implantation.
