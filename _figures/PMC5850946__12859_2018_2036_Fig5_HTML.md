caption: Interesting gene regulatory interactions with respect to PI3K-Akt signaling
  and Ras signaling pathway. PI3K-Akt signaling components are represented by oval
  shape. Genes involved in Ras signaling are represented by rectangular shape. Yellow
  color represent the perturbed genes involved in both signaling pathway. In this
  figure, we have shown the PI3K-Akt enriched genes in red color, while the genes
  enriched in Ras pathway are represented by rectangular shape. The yellow color represents
  the genes which undergoes perturbation experiments to obtain the gene-gene regulatory
  network. The edges with arrow signs represent the four fold increase in the expression
  of target/effected genes, while edges with dot represent the four fold down-regulation
