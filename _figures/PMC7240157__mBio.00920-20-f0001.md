caption: 'Model for the utilization of host FAs for phosphatidylglycerol (PG) synthesis
  by S. aureus. (A) FA kinase is the only pathway for the activation of extracellular
  FAs in S. aureus. Host FAs bind to one of the two FA binding proteins. FakB1 specifically
  binds saturated FA (16:0), and FakB2 selectively binds monounsaturated FA (18:1).
  The FakB(FA) complexes are phosphorylated by FakA, converting host FAs to the key
  intermediate, acyl-PO4. The resulting acyl-PO4 has two fates: PlsX and PlsY. PlsX
  converts acyl-PO4 to acyl-ACP that is elongated by FASII before being converted
  again to acyl-PO4 by PlsX. FASII produces 15:0 ACP that is preferentially used by
  PlsC to acylate the 2 position. (B) Structure of PG. The major membrane phospholipid
  of S. aureus consists of a glycerol phosphate backbone (blue) that is first acylated
  in the 1 position by acyl-PO4-dependent PlsY (green) followed by acylation of the
  2 position by 15:0-ACP-selective PlsC (red). The glycerol headgroup (gold) is added
  by a series of three enzymes. There are four stereocenters (*) in the example show
  the abundant 17:0/15:0 PG molecular species (32:0 PG; m/z 721) of S. aureus.'
