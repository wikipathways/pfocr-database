caption: The follicle cell-derived Kitlga specifically targets its receptor Kita on
  the oocyte with a minor action on Kitb on the follicle cells as well, similar to
  the KITL-KIT system in mammals. The Kitlgb, however, is exclusively expressed in
  the oocyte and it acts on its specific receptor Kitb on the follicle cells, representing
  a potential paracrine signaling pathway for the oocyte to control the follicle cells.
  The expression of Kitlga in the follicle cells is likely subject to regulation by
  various endocrine and/or paracrine factors, therefore mediating the actions of these
  factors on the oocyte.
