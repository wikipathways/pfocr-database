caption: Host immune response to viral infection (Interferon Signaling Pathways).
  HCV RNA is recognized by the RNA-helicase, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I).
  This interaction recruits IPS-1 activating a signaling cascade with a final activation
  of interferon regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3 & IRF7). IRF 3 & 7 induce IFN-α production
  []. Viral RNA can also be sensed by toll-like receptor 7 (TLR-7), which recruits
  TRAF6, IRAK1 and IRAK4, subsequently activating IRF-7 and inducing IFN-α production
  []. Released IFN binds to its receptor, interferon-α-receptor (IFNAR), leading to
  phosphorylation and activation of janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2).
  Both kinases activate STAT 1 & 2, which form a complex with IRF9 and induce the
  expression of the ISG, MxA []. The JAK/STAT pathway is regulated by SOCS1, which
  inhibits STAT1 activation []. RIG-I and TLR-7 pathways as well as IFN induce the
  expression of miR-146a and miR-155 [–]. MiR-146a targets and inhibits IRAK1, TRAF6
  and STAT1, suppressing interferon release and the JAK/STAT pathway [, ], while miR-155
  inhibits SOCS1, enhancing the JAK/STAT pathway [].
