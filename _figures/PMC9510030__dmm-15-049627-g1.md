caption: 'Integration of RAS/MAPK signalling with the insulin/IGF signalling pathway.
  The RAS/MAPK signalling pathway is intricately connected to the insulin/IGF signalling
  pathway. Upon ligand binding, the activated insulin receptor recruits IRS proteins
  to the intracellular receptor tail. These then assemble other adaptor proteins,
  including GRB2, to the activated insulin receptor complex. GRB2 then binds to and
  localises the RAS-GEF, SOS and, by association, activated RAS. Active GTP-bound
  RAS then binds to and activates its effector molecules, including RAF, initiating
  a phosphorylation cascade via MEK and ERK. As a key downstream effector of RAS/MAPK
  signalling, activated ERK phosphorylates multiple cytoplasmic and cytoskeletal proteins,
  including the energy-sensing AMPK. ERK can also translocate to the nucleus, where
  it phosphorylates and activates several transcription factors, including members
  of the ETS transcription factor family. In parallel, activation of PI3K leads to
  the phosphorylation and activation of AKT, which can translocate to the nucleus
  to phosphorylate FOXO. This phosphorylation results in the nuclear exclusion of
  FOXO, thereby preventing FOXO target gene expression. Cross-regulation of the two
  pathways occurs at multiple nodes: activated RAS can bind to and activate PI3K and
  activated ERK phosphorylates FOXO, leading to FOXO degradation via the ubiquitin
  proteosome system. AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; ERK,
