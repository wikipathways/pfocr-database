  Top network identified by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of differentially methylated
  genes related to cell cycle, cellular assembly, and organization. (b) Top network
  identified by IPA of differentially methylated genes related to organ development
  and function. Colored nodes indicate differentially methylated genes. Noncolored
  nodes were proposed by IPA and suggest potential targets functionally coordinated
  with the differentially methylated genes. Dashed lines represent indirect relationships,
  and solid lines indicate direct molecular interactions. In each network, edge types
  are indicatives: a line without arrowhead indicates binding only; a line finishing
  with a vertical line indicates inhibition; a line with an arrowhead indicates ‘acts
  on.'' (c) Protein-protein interaction network of selected differentially methylated
  genes. Using the OmicsNet database, six genes (AURKA, HDAC4, CARHSP1, CACNA1H, CACNA1C,
  and DNAH2) were used to construct a top-ranked functional protein-protein interaction
  network.'
