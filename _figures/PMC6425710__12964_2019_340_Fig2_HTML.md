caption: Under pathologic circumstances, pericytes present stemness or trans-differentiation
  potential. Brain injury induces pericytes to leave capillary and achieve microglial
  phenotype while pericyte marker expression retains. After ischemic stroke, the suppression
  of the pericytes aPKC-CBP signaling pathway contributes in reemergence of induced
  neural precursors markers 3 days post-stroke. However, iSCs generation in ischemic
  regions pericytes is plausible by co-expressing MSCs, Neural stem/progenitor cells,
  and vascular lineage markers along with pericytes markers. Utilization of neural-
  or endothelial-conditioned medium on iPCs culture in vitro leads to neural or vascular
  lineage generation
