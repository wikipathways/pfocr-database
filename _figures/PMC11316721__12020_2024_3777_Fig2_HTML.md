caption: Molecular mechanisms of RBP4 in pancreatic β-cell function. In islets, STRA6
  was specifically colocalized with insulin-positive β-cells. RBP4 can interact directly
  with STRA6 and upregulate its expression. RBP4/STRA6 activates the JAK2/STAT1 signaling
  pathway. The activation of STAT1 by RBP4 increased the binding ability of this gene
  to the promoter of Isl-1 and inhibited its expression, further decreasing insulin
  transcription and inhibiting insulin synthesis. STRA6 retinoic acid 6, JAK2 Janus
  kinase 2, STAT1 signal transducer and activator of transcription 1
