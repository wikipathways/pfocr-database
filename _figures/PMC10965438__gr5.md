caption: Nanomaterials preventing TAM infiltration for the treatment of HCC.(A) The
  CXCR4-SDF1α signaling pathway. (1) ADOPSor NPs inhibits CXCR4, thereby blocking
  SDF1α and reducing TAMs infiltration caused by SOR. (2) VEGF siRNA in AMD-NPs inhibits
  CXCR4, thereby blocking SDF1α and reducing TAM infiltration caused by VEGF reduction.(B)
  ROS. CeO2NPs reduce TAM infiltration by inhibiting ROS in HCC tissues. CeO2NPs reduces
  TAMs infiltration by inhibiting ROS in HCC tissues. TAMs, Tumor-associated macrophages;
  HCC, Hepatocellular carcinoma; CXCR4, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4; SDF1α, Stromal-derived-factor1α;
  ADOPSor NPs, AMD3100 coated DOPA-PLGA nanoparticles containing sorafenib; SOR, Sorafenib;
  VEGF siRNA in AMD-NPs, Vascular endothelial-derived growth factor short interfering
  RNA in AMD3100-nanoparticles; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; CeO2NPs, Cerium oxide
  nanoparticles
