caption: Intracellular processing of remdesivir (GS-5734). Upon diffusion into the
  cell, remdesivir (GS-5734), the aryloxy phosphoramidate (purple) prodrug of GS-441524
  monophosphate, is metabolized into the nucleoside monophosphate form, via a sequence
  of steps leading to the synthesis of the intermediate alanine metabolite GS-704277,
  which is further hydrolyzed by phosphoramidase-type enzymes to liberate the nucleoside
  monophosphate (modified from Eastman et al. []). The nucleoside monophosphate undergoes
  further phosphorylation events via the endogenous phosphorylation pathway, generating
  the active nucleoside triphosphate analogue form that can then be misintegrated
  into viral RNA by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), inducing delayed
  chain termination (for more details see Eastman et al. []). Nsp8 is shown in yellow
  and nsp7 in magenta.
