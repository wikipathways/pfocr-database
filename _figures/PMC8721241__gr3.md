caption: The function of ABA in seed germination and seedling establishment. Left,
  Seed completes germination successfully through degradation of active ABA into PA
  (phaseic acid) and DPA (dihydrophaseic acid)/DPAG with CYP707As regulated by REF6
  and phaseic acid reductase (ABH2 and GT) respectively. During germination and seedling
  establishment, the core ABA signaling component SnRK2s and downstream ABI3/4/5 are
  activated or repressed by many factors directly or indirectly to promote seed germination
  and seedling establishment. For example, RAV1 and BASS2 bind to the ABI4 promoter
  to inhibit ABI4 expression, while MYB96 promotes ABI4 expression through binding
  to its promoter. A Casein Kinase 2 promotes ABI4 expression indirectly. Furthermore,
  ANAC060 transcription is activated directly by ABI4 through binding to its promoter
  to enhance post-germination. Several BTB-A2 proteins can impair SnRK2.3 stability
  to act as negative regulators of ABA signaling. NRT1.2 is identified as an ABA transporter
  to regulate downstream factors ABI1-ABI5, RAB18, etc. positively to mediate germination
  and seedling development. Further, some negative factors such as SUN24, UGT74E2,
  FOF2, and VQs regulate seed germination and seedling development through repressing
  ABI3-, ABI5-mediated ABA pathway. Activated and repressive effects are shown by
  arrows and bars, respectively.
