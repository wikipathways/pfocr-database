caption: 'Biosynthesis and role of 7α,25-OHC in cDC localization within secondary
  lymphoid organs. 7α,25-OHC, an oxysterol derived from cholesterol, is crucial for
  the precise positioning of immune cells within secondary lymphoid tissues, such
  as LNs and the spleen, by acting as a ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor
  EBI2 (GPR183). 7α,25-OHC biosynthesis involves two steps: cholesterol is first converted
  to 25-OHC by CH25H, and then 25-OHC is hydroxylated at the 7α-position by the cytochrome
  P450 enzyme CYP7B1 to form 7α,25-OHC. In LNs and the spleen, 7α,25-OHC is primarily
  produced at the borders of B cell follicles. By binding to EBI2, 7α,25-OHC directs
  the migration of immune cells, including B cells, T cells, and cDC2s, to perifollicular
  regions surrounding B cell follicles. This positioning is regulated by counteracting
  the chemotactic signals of two other receptor-ligand systems: CCR7-CCL19/CCL21 and
  CXCR5-CXCL13. CCL19 and CCL21, the ligands for CCR7, are produced in T cell areas
  and guides CCR7-expressing cells to these zones, while CXCL13, the ligand for CXCR5,
  is produced within B cell follicles and attracts CXCR5-expressing cells into the
  follicles. Thus, the localization of cells to T cell areas, B cell follicles, or
  perifollicular regions, including the T-B boundary and interfollicular locations,
  depends on the coordinated actions of EBI2-, CCR7-, and CXCR5-dependent signaling
  pathways. Migratory cDCs, particularly cDC2s, can express all three receptors—CCR7,
  CXCR5, and EBI2—but their expression levels vary depending on their activation state.
  During type 2 inflammation, low CCR7 expression combined with upregulation of CXCR5
  and EBI2 facilitates the guidance of cDC2s and CD4+ T cells to the T-B cell boundary
  and peri- and inter-follicular regions in response to the ligands for these receptors.
  Such localization is essential for initiating Th2 and Tfh cell responses. Thus,
  the coordinated actions of EBI2-, CCR7-, and CXCR5-dependent signaling pathways
  are crucial for the effective localization and function of cDCs and cognate T cells
  during the initiation of type 2 immunity. Figure created with Biorender'
