caption: DNA damage response defects in high risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB). 50% of HR-NB
  are MYCN amplified resulting in increased expression of DNA repair genes (MRE11,
  CHEK1, BLM etc.) and genes driving proliferation (CDC25A, AURKB etc.), leading to
  replication stress and DNA damage through replication errors. 30% harbor 11q loss
  of heterozygosity (LOH) resulting in reduced expression of many proteins involved
  in the response to double strand breaks (blue). p53 pathway (purple) dysfunction
  is common at NB relapse leading to defective G1 checkpoint arrest.
