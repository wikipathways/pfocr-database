caption: '. (A) Wiki Pathway analysis of overlapping upregulated DEG changes observed
  in both LDHA/B DKO and GPI KO in energy pathways. The PPARGC1A differential transcript
  changes were as follows: WT versus LDHA/B DKO: (FC +3.43, FDR p-Value<0.001); WT
  versus GPI KO: (FC +3.39, FDR p-Value <0.001). (B) Wiki Pathway analysis of overlapping
  up-regulated DEF changes observed in both LDHA/B DKO and GPI KO in the HMG-CoA pathway.
  The HMGCS2 differential transcript changes were as follows: WT versus LDHA/B DKO:
  (FC +3.43, FDR p-Value<0.001); WT versus GPI KO: (FC +3.39, FDR p-Value<0.001).
  In red are the down-regulated transcripts and in green the up-regulated transcripts.
  Filtered by fold change <-2 or >2, p-Value<0.05.'
