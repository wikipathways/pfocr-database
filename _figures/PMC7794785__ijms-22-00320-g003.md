caption: 'Schematic representation of the signaling pathways involved in increased
  K+ permeability and hyperpolarizing effects of A1R activation. A1Rs activate G protein-coupled
  inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels directly via the G protein subunits (Gα and
  Gβγ) or indirectly by inhibiting PLC activity. A1Rs increase ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP)
  channel activity by inhibiting the AC/cAMP pathway or by both stimulating (via increased
  PKC) or inhibiting (via increased PIP2) the PLC pathway. A1R-induced IP3 stimulation
  activates small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels by increasing intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration. The pathway underlying activation of two-pore domain K+ (K2P)
  channels is unknown and therefore not presented here. AC: adenyl cyclase; cAMP:
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA: protein kinase A; PLC: phospholipase C; PIP2:
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; DAG: diacylglycerol;
  PKC: phosphokinase C.'
