caption: TLR7/9 Signaling pathway leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  and type I IFN. Receptor recognizes nucleic acid ligand and recruits adaptor protein
  MyD88. MyD88 attracts kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4 to the complex, which can then activate
  TRAF6. Activated TRAF6 leads to the stimulation of transcription factors NFκB, IRF5,
  and IRF7 to produce cytokines and type I IFN. IRF7 has been identified as the primary
  factor in production of type I IFN, but there is evidence that IRF5 can also contribute
  to type I IFN production [].
