caption: Schematic representation of TNFα and IFNγ secretions induced by HLA-G signalling
  pathway. Soluble HLA-G has been known to be a ligand for KIR2DL4. Soluble HLA-G
  originates from cell surface-bound HLA-G. Metalloproteinase (a protease enzyme)
  is responsible for the cleavage/release of HLA-G from the surface. The experimental
  setting used to fit the data also used soluble HLA-G to stimulate KIR2DL4. In our
  model, we assumed that the HLA-G that binds to KIR2DL4 is soluble HLA-G. The transient
  passage of endocytosed KIR2DL4 receptor at the cell surface occurs when an NK cell
  is activated by IL-2 is sufficient to capture soluble HLA-G and transport it to
  the endosomes. The endocytosed HLA-G/KIR2DL4 complex recruits FCεRIγ and aggregate
  FCεRIγ. FCεRIγ activation is known to induce phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) ,.
  PI3K-mediated production of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3)
  allosterically enhances PLC activity downstream. This early signalling pathway then
  activates the NFAT futile cycle and initiates the regulation of IFNγ and TNFα secretion
  in NK cells.
