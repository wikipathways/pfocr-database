caption: LncRNAs regulate epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. (A) LncRNAs
  regulate the expression of downstream target genes through sponge miRNA, and then
  activate the NF-κB pathway, promoting inflammation and apoptosis. (B) LncRNAs directly
  target mRNAs to regulate gene expression, activating the NF-κB pathway and promoting
  inflammation and apoptosis. (C) LncRNAs act as modular scaffolds for RNA binding
  proteins, coordinating their localization and specific binding to the target genes,
  inducing cell apoptosis and inflammation. (D) LncRNA NEAT1 regulates glucose metabolism
  via miR-410–3p/LDHA axis, influencing intestinal barrier homeostasis. (E) LncRNA
  LINC01272 promotes TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by targeting
  miR-153–5p, leading to loss of epithelial cells and increase in tissue damage.
