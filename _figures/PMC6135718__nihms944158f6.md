caption: EGFR (also known as ERBB1 and HER1) and ERBB2 (also known as HER2/neu) are
  the main therapeutic targets of currently available anti-angiogenic drugs. ERBB2
  lacks the ability to bind growth factor ligands and forms heterodimers with EGFR,
  ERBB3, or ERBB4. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the extracellular domain such as
  trastuzumab and pertuzumab prevent heterodimer formation, while others such as cetuximab,
  necitumumab, and panitumumab competitively inhibit EGFR ligand binding. Receptor
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors target the intracellular kinase domains and prevent signaling
  downstream of ligand-binding and dimer formation.
