caption: Schematic representation of natural killer (NK) cell activating receptor
  signaling. Interaction of activating receptor NKG2D and Ly49D with their cognate
  ligand leads to phosphorylation of YINM motif or immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motifs (ITAMs) present in the cytoplasmic tails of associated adapter protein such
  as DAP10 and DAP12. Phosphorylated ITAM or YINM motif recruits Syk/Zap70, PI3K,
  and Grb2/Vav1/SLP-76 complex. Grb2/Vav1/SLP-76 pathway activation leads to downstream
  activation of MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Phosphorylated
  Syk recruits PLC-γ which in turn activates inducible protein-3 (IP-3) and DAG pathway
  leading to activation of transcription factors NF-κB and NFAT. The net result of
  this signaling is the release of cytokines and chemokines as well as cytotoxic molecules
  by the NK cells ().
