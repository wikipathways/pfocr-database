caption: Hypothalamic SELENOM promotes ER homeostasis and TXN activity. SELENOM enhances
  activity of the TXN system, which serves to attenuate ER stress and facilitate activation
  of the NF-κB pathway. Leptin also promotes NF-κB activation in parallel with its
  documented effect on STAT3 signaling. On stimulation, both NF-κB and STAT3 translocate
  to the nucleus and act as transcription factors on a host of target genes. CEBPD,
  LCN2, and TXNIP comprise NF-κB target genes that are significantly downregulated
  by SELENOM deficiency. Color images are available online only.
