caption: The enriched canonical pathway for RIG-I like receptor signaling at 48 hps
  with dsRNA. Pathway analysis using KEGG Mapper allowed us to identify the pathways
  that were differentially expressed between dsRNA-stimulated and non-stimulated LV-1
  cells. Red and blue shading indicates increased and decreased expression, respectively,
  in dsRNA-stimulated LV-1 cells relative to the non-stimulated control cells. White
  and green shading indicates non-expression and non-differential expression, respectively.
  Solid and dashed lines represent direct and indirect interactions, respectively.
