caption: Structure and Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and acute lung injury.
  A Schematic structure of SARS-CoV-2 virus is a positive single-stranded RNA virus.
  Nucleic acid is encapsulated with viral nucleocapsid protein. The outer structure
  comprises four proteins, namely, envelope protein, hemagglutinin protein dimer,
  spike protein, and membrane-associated glycoprotein. The accessory proteins or non-structural
  proteins are encoded by the viral genome to assist infectivity and perpetuation.
  B Cascade of events in SARS-CoV-2 binding and replication and host response. (1)
  Viral spike binds to ACE2 and entry is assisted by cleavage by TMPRSS2 and fusion
  of the virus particle. (2) Release of viral genome and replication by viral RNA
  polymerase, upon which host antiviral/ ds-RNA sensing RIG-I pathway is activated
  (not shown) to produce interferons. (3) Translation of viral proteins, both structural
  and non-structural using host rough endoplasmic reticulum. (4) Posttranslational
  modifications and assembly of structural proteins. (5) Packaging and development
  of new virions. (6) Exocytosis new virions and infection of new cells. (7) Vesicular
  internalization is the second mode of viral entry initiating host inflammatory response
  and chemotaxis via TLR 7,8/MyD88/NFkB pathway. (8) SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins
  trigger NLRP3/ASC/Casp-1/IL-1b-dependent pyroptosis. (9) Viral infection and antigen
  presentation by dendritic cells and macrophages leading to the elicitation of anti-viral
  response by B and T lymphocytes. (10) Dysregulated inflammatory response and extravasation
  of neutrophils and cytokine storm results in acute lung injury.
