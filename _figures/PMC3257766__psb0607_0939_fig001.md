caption: Proposed MeJA signaling pathway and signal crosstalk between MeJA and ABA
  in Arabidopsis guard cells. MeJA induces ROS and NO production in guard cells. RCN1-regulating
  PP2As are involved in this step. The major ROS sourses are NAD(P)H oxidases AtrbohD/F.
  NOS activity seems to be important for MeJA-induced NO production, but genes encoding
  NOS have not been indentified in plants. ROS and NO evoke guard cell [Ca2+]cyt elevation
  by Ca2+ influx from apoplast and from intracellular stores, respectively. ICa channels
  mediate Ca2+ influx from apoplast. Elevated [Ca2+]cyt is sensed by CDPKs including
  CPK6 and finally activates S-type anion channels. The abi2-1 mutation disrupts ROS-mediated
  ICa channel activation. The abi2-1 mutation also disrupts NO-dependent signal pathway,
  but the details are still unclear. Two myrosinases TGG1 and TGG2 are also involved
  in the signal crosstalk.
