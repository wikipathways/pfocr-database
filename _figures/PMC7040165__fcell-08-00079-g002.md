caption: Controlling pluripotency using small molecule inhibitors and growth factors.
  Primed and Naïve pluripotent stem cells cultured in various conditions in the presence
  of small molecule inhibitors and multiple growth factors to govern the self-renewal,
  pluripotency, and conversion of primed to naïve pluripotent stem cells. (A) All
  the inhibitors indicated by “i.” Red blunt-headed arrow demonstrates the inhibition
  of differentiation and expression of lineage-committed markers such as Nestin, FGF5,
  Sox17, Lefty, T-Brachyury, and Lefty2. (B) Pluripotent characteristics of PSCs controlled
  by multiple growth factors. Key growth factors contributing to maintainance of pluripotency
  of PSCs are summarized.
