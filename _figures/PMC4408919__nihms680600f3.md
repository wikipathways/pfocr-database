caption: 'Drug action on folate synthesis is shown in blue. Both trimethoprim and
  sulfonamides are considered ‘inhibitors’ of enzymes in the folate synthesis pathway,
  but while trimethoprim inhibits catalysis by competing with dihydrofolic acid for
  binding to Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), sulfonamides compete with para-aminobenzoic
  acid for binding to Dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and, rather than preventing
  catalysis, are covalently linked by DHPS to the substrate pteridine diphosphate.
  Our data () and mathematical analysis () show that this mechanistic distinction
  between flux inhibition or flux diversion leads to resistance by target overexpression
  for trimethoprim but not for sulfonamides. HPPK: 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin
  pyrophosphokinase; ADCL: Aminodeoxy-chorismate lyase; FPGS: Folylpolyglutamate synthetase.'
