caption: 'Disturbances of cell–cell communication routes to maintain the BBB in pathological
  disorders. Environmental changes due to age, external stimuli or certain neurodegenerative
  pathologies can alter the BBB over time. A loss of TJ sealing, a disruption of efflux
  pump activity and an increase in vesicular transport in ECs are therefore observed.
  Direct damage to ECs implies a deleterious inflammatory stress for the BBB, which
  will send some stress signals to other components of the NVU via EVs. To some extent,
  the BBB becomes more permeable to circulating molecules allowing the entry of external
  compounds and the extravasation of leukocytes into the CNS. The cell–cell communications
  between ECs and the different components of the NVU are altered. The damage on BP
  coverage leads to a decrease in the neuroprotective effect of these cells, leading
  to microhaemorrhages and neurodegenerative diseases. Activated astrocytes will promote
  endothelial proliferation with overactivation of the SHH signalling pathway, as
  well as a degradation of the endothelial basement membrane due to MMPs secretion.
  The direct role of neuron upon a neurodegenerative-dependent stress on the BBB features
  remains obscure. However, some studies suggest an indirect role based on altered
  cell–cell communication processes with both astrocytes and BPs leading to a BBB
  leakage. Abbreviation: AJs: Adherens Junction, BPs: Brain Pericytes, EEATs: Excitatory
