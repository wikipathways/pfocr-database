caption: A proposed pathway facilitating the removal of ROS/RNS by internal antioxidant
  systems with ACN support. ROS/RNS production is a natural process occurring in most
  aerobic cells. Increased production is therefore related to injurious stimuli. Internal
  antioxidant systems are present to facilitate the removal of normal ROS/RNS production
  (pictured at point 1); however, inadequate removal or excessive production can result
  in cellular pathology such as lipid, protein and DNA damage (pictured at point 2).
  Anthocyanins can support this facilitated removal through their additional antioxidant
  properties, preventing further pathological progression.
