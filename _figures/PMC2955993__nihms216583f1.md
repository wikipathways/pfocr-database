caption: All three pathways converge at the third component of complement (C3) which
  is activated by pathway-specific C3 convertases []. The classical pathway is initiated
  by antigen-antibody (Ag-Ab) complexes and requires the participation of C1, C2,
  and C4. The lectin pathway is triggered through interaction of the mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL) with specific microbial carbohydrate groups, followed by activation
  of MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and cleavage of C2 and C4. The alternative
  pathway is initiated by spontaneously hydrolyzed C3 [C3(H2O)] which can thereby
  form a complex with factor B (fB), followed by fB cleavage by factor D (fD) and
  formation of the initial alternative pathway C3 convertase []. Morerover, the alternative
  pathway can be induced by bacterial lipopolysacharide and lipooligosacharide in
  a properdin-dependent way []. Proteolytic cleavage of a series of proteins downstream
  of C3 leads to the generation of potent effector molecules. These include the inflammatory
  anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which activate specific receptors (C3aR and C5aR, respectively),
  although C5a also interacts with the so-called C5a receptor-like 2 (C5L2), which
  appears to mediate both regulatory and proinflammatory effects [–]. In the terminal
  pathway, C5b initiates the assembly of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC),
  which in turn induces microbial cell lysis [] or host cell signaling at sublytic
  concentrations [, ]. Complement activation is regulated at multiple steps by various
  regulatory proteins, as indicated by the characteristic inhibitory symbols. C1NH,
  C1 inhibitor; C4BP, C4b-binding protein; CR1; complement receptor 1; DAF, decay
  accelerating factor; fH, factor H; FHR-1, fH-related protein 1.
