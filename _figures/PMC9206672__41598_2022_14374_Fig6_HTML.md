caption: Model of acetaldehyde-induced DNA damage and maintenance of genome stability
  by persimmon polyphenols. (Left) In the absence of persimmon polyphenols, acetaldehyde
  produced from ethanol induces DNA adducts/interstrand cross-links (ICLs). In the
  S phase of the cell cycle, replication forks encounter acetaldehyde-induced DNA
  damage and are recognised by FA pathway components and DSBs are generated by nucleolytic
  incision. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in S phase are repaired by homologous recombination
  (HR). In G1 phase, acetaldehyde-induced DNA damage might be recognised and cleaved
  by unidentified endonuclease to generate DSBs. DSBs in G1 phase are repaired by
  non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). (Right) In the presence of persimmon polyphenols
  or EGC, acetaldehyde bridges polyphenols or is used for polyphenol aggregation.
  As a result, acetaldehyde is removed from the medium.
