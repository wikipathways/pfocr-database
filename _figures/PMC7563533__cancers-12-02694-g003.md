caption: Various RNA interference (RNAi) constructs used for temporary or permanent
  gene silencing and a general workflow of small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening
  towards drug repositioning (adapted from []). (a) siRNA, endoribonuclease-prepared
  siRNA (esiRNA), and long double-strand RNA (dsRNA), as naked RNAs, can be introduced
  to the cell through many pathways, such as lipid-based transfection reagents or
  electroporation, or active uptake by target cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis.
  Inside the cytoplasm, dsRNA is cleaved by endonucleases. Then, the obtained siRNA,
  along with the directly introduced siRNAs and siRNAs coming from the nucleus of
  hard-to-transfect cells which were achieved from viral vectors carrying siRNA or
  short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes, are loaded into the RNA-induced
  Silencing Complex (RISC) to facilitate gene expression knock down. (b) Drug targets
  and available compounds are determined by in silico pathway analyses and database
  mining after two-step in vitro screening. Prior to clinical analysis, the efficiency
  of these drug candidates can be validated by in vitro and in vivo approaches.
