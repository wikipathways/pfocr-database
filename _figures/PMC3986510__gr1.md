caption: Ceramide de novo synthesis pathway. Sphingolipids are synthesized de novo
  in the endoplasmic reticulum. First and rate limiting step is the condensation of
  amino acid serine with saturated fatty acid palmitate which is catalyzed by serine
  palmitoyl transferase. Subsequent reduction to sphinganine is catalyzed by 3-ketosphinganine
  reductase. A variety of ceramide synthases (CerS1–6) catalyze the conjugation of
  a second acyl-CoA of variable chain length (C14-C32) leading to formation of dihydroceramide.
  Dihydroceramide desaturase converts the intermediaries into proper ceramides.
