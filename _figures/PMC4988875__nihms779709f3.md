caption: When the leucine degradation pathway is blocked, a route to isovaleryl CoA
  is used that involves de novo synthesis of 3MG CoA from acetyl CoA (left side).
  Once formed, 3MG CoA is metabolized to isovaleryl CoA via two enzymatic reactions
  that do not exist in humans. Isovaleryl CoA subsequently serves as primer for iso-odd
  chain fatty acid biosynthesis.
