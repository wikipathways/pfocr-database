caption: 'Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway highlighting the biologically active metabolites
  and pleotropic activities. Statins have wide-reaching immunomodulatory properties
  that are mainly driven by inhibition of the isoprenoids geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to perform protein prenylation (ie, isoprenylation),
  which is a downstream effect of inhibiting hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
  reductase in the mevalonate pathway for the synthesis of cholesterol. Abbreviation:
  GPP, geranyl pyrophosphate.'
