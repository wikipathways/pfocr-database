caption: Fig. 1. The Dpp signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. The Mad–Medea
  complex is essential for gene activation and gene repression. Shn is essential for
  Mad/Medea-mediated repression of brk transcription, but is dispensable for Dpp-mediated
  transcriptional activation of most target genes. The question mark indicates the
  possibility that Shn has additional functions since the brk, shn double mutant embryos
  are not identical to the brk single mutant embryos (T.Marty and M.Affolter, data
  not shown but see ). Evidence suggesting that Shn also acts as an activator of transcription
  together with Mad has been provided (); it remains to be investigated in vivo whether
  Shn is required for gene activation in certain cases. Arrows denote upregulation;
  bars denote downregulation.
