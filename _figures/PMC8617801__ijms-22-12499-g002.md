caption: Oligodendrocyte dysfunction in HD. In the first pathway, full-length MYRF
  is self-cleaved to nMYRF which detaches from ER and is translocated to the nucleus
  to regulate the expression of myelin related genes. In HD, N-terminal mHTT binds
  nMYRF causing abnormal binding of nMYRF and deficit myelin genes expression. Second
  pathway shows inhibition of PGC-1α expression by interference of mHTT in co-binding
  of CREB and TAF4, leading to reduced activity in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway
  and myelination deficit. Created with BioRender.com.
