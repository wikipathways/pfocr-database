caption: Molecular mechanisms of anti-cancer therapy resistance mediated by integrins
  and PD-L1. (a) αvβ3 and αvβ6 integrins promote PD-L1 expression in tumor cells,
  thereby facilitating immune surveillance evasion and leading to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy
  resistance. (b) PD-L1 directly interacts with β6 integrin in tumor cells, thereby
  activating the αvβ6 integrin/FAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, which suppresses cisplatin-induced
  apoptosis. In addition, αvβ6 integrin activates TGF-β from a latent precursor to
  induce SOX4 expression, which contributes to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance.
  (c) PD-L1 directly binds to β1 integrin, thereby activating NF-κB signaling and
  conferring resistance to cisplatin
