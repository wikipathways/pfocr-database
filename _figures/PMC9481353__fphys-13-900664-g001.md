caption: The signaling pathways involved in myocardial IPC and RPCT. This diagram
  depicts the protective effect of ischemic and non-ischemic preconditioning on acute
  myocardial ischemia. Transient I/R prior to ischemia attenuated subsequent sustained
  I/R injury. Remote IPC refers to the ischemic preconditioning of other organs and
  tissues, such as kidney, mesenteric artery and limbs that besides the heart, that
  can also protect the myocardium from I/R injury. IPC is mainly involved in myocardial
  protection through the Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase (RISK) pathway, PI3K-Akt
  and Mek1/2-Erk1/2 pathways, and Survivor Activator Factor Enhancement (SAFE), TNF
  and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Distal nonischemic stimuli, including electrical
  stimulation, skin incisions, and acute pain, improve myocardial I/R injury by stimulating
  peripheral nerves to release cardioprotective factors into the bloodstream of the
  myocardium. (RISK, Reperfusion Injury Salvage Kinase; SAFE, Survivor Activator Factor
  Enhancement; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition pore).
