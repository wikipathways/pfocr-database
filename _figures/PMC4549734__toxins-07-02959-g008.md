caption: Schema of general SSTR pathway and function. After activation by its ligands,
  in turn activates Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. ERK1/2 than activates either p21 or p70S6K,
  depending on its own level of activation. This leads to, ERK1/2-dependent, p21-mediated
  cell cycle arrest, or p70S6K-mediated cell growth, respectively [].
