caption: ACPA-related RA immunopathogenesis. ACPAs activate macrophages via IC formation
  and agonistic activity. They bind to the grp78 protein and TLR4 on the cell surface
  to elicit an inflammatory response. Additionally, through the binding of ICs and
  FcγR, proinflammatory cytokines and M-CSF are released (A). Neutrophils and ACPAs
  interact in a self-perpetuating manner. As NETosis releases massive amounts of citrullinated
  antigens to drive ACPA production, the ACPA formation of ICs promotes further neutrophil
  netting and the release of degradative enzymes and reactive oxygen species upon
  binding with FcγR (B). Autoreactive B cells baring surface ACPAs can serve as APCs
  to promote citrulline-specific T cell maturation/differentiation and secrete various
  proinflammatory cytokines (C). Direct ACPA targeting enhances osteoclast differentiation.
  The binding of ICs via FcγR activates osteoclasts and promotes proinflammatory cytokine
  production (D). ACPAs interact with citrullinated cellular proteins and enhance
  fibroblast migration (E). Complement activation takes place via both the classical
  pathway and the alternative pathway. ACPAs also cross-react with type II collagen
  within joint cartilage, resulting in joint destruction (F). ACPAs, anti-citrullinated
  peptide antibodies; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; FcγR,
  Fc gamma receptors; IC, immune complex; C5a, complement 5a; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor.
