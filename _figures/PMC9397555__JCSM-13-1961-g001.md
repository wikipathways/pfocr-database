caption: Collaboration between various phagocytosis receptors in the uptake of apoptotic
  cells. In the initiation of engulfment, increasing the amount of the GTP‐bound Rac1
  plays the central role. This is achieved by either enhancing the GDP/GTP exchange
  on Rac1 catalysed by the Dock180/ELMO complex, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  (GEF) for Rac1, or by attenuating the GTPase activity of Rac1 (which would hydrolyse
  GTP back to GDP) achieved by the GULP pathway. GULP inhibits very likely the GTPase
  activating protein (GAP) of Rac1. Some of the phagocytic receptors promote the assembly
  of the Dock180 and ELMO proteins to generate the functional GEF complex, while others
  interact with GULP. Sequentially, GTP loading of RhoA and dynamin needs also to
  be enhanced as they contribute to later phases of efferocytosis. To promote Rac1
  activation, integrins trigger simultaneously three distinct signalling pathways
  involving activation of focal adhesion (FAK), src (SRC), and phosphoinositide‐3
  (not shown on the figure) kinases, respectively, leading to the assembly of Dock180/ELMO
  complex. FAK and SRC do so by activating both the UNC‐73/RhoG and the p130CAS/CrkII
  pathways via tyrosine phosphorylating the proteins participating in them. Sequential
  enrichment of phosphoinositides generated by the phosphoinositide‐3 kinases in the
  inner leaflet of the plasma membrane will then guide the recruitment of the assembled
  Dock180/ELMO to the phagocytic cup via the phosphoinositide recognizing domains
  of both proteins. CD36, TG2, and Tim4 act as coreceptors for the integrin receptors,
  while the TAM kinases Mer and Axl act via enhancing the integrin‐mediated signalling
  pathways. Simultaneously, following PS binding a trimeric complex is also formed
  that includes BAI1, ELMO, and DOCK180 that further promotes Rac1 activation (GTP
  loading). To enhance the effectiveness of all the aforementioned receptors, both
  CD300f and CD300b act as activators of phosphoinositide‐3‐kinase pathway. Many other
  phagocytic receptors, on the other hand, contribute to increasing the amount of
  GTP‐loaded Rac1 via the GULP adaptor protein pathway. These include CD91, SCARF1,
  stabilin‐2, MEGF10, and SR‐B1. Interestingly, while the bridging molecule C1q links
  PS only to those phagocytic receptors that are coupled to GULP, the bridging molecules
  MFG‐E8, protein S (ProtS), Gas6, and thrombospondin (TSP) activate receptors that
  promote the Dock180/ELMO assembly. GULP, in addition, is also associated with dynamin
  activation, while spliced Grp56 functions very likely coupled to the Gα12,13/RhoA
  signalling pathways. The signalling pathways induced by LOX‐1 and RAGE in the context
  of efferocytosis have not been investigated yet.
