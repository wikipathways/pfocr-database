caption: 'KKS pathway, inflammation, MMP, and oxidative stress are all involved in
  the process of DR, and they are closely related to each other. The inflammation
  response can activate the KKS pathway, MMP and oxidative stress, and bradykinin
  produced by KKS, MMP and ROS induced by oxidative stress in turn promote the inflammatory
  response. Besides, oxidative stress can activate MMP via ROS, and MMP can promote
  oxidative stress by damaging mitochondria. As for association with VEGF, KKS function
  independently in the vitreous, while inflammation elevate the expression of VEGF
  and in turn VEGF intensify the inflammation response. Oxidative stress downregulates
  certain mi-Rs, which ultimately increase the expression of VEGF, and VEGF can increase
  the expression of MMP-9. Apart from these four pathways, there are some other molecules
  are involved, some of them are protective molecules and others are destructive.
  DR: Diabetic retinopathy; KKS: Kallikrein-Kinin System; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase;
  VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor; ROS: Reactive oxygen species.'
