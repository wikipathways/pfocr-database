caption: 'Cellular Mechanisms of mTOR in BCSCs: This schematic illustrates the multifaceted
  roles of mTOR in regulating cellular functions in BCSCs, with implications in metastasis,
  metabolism, autophagy, and ferroptosis. The mTOR pathway integrates signals from
  nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy levels, modulating various downstream
  pathways to influence cell fate. Key mechanisms are highlighted: Ferroptosis Inhibition:
  mTOR interacts with mitochondrial VDAC1, modulating ferroptosis pathways critical
  for cell survival under oxidative stress. Cytoskeletal Rearrangement, Cell Motility,
  and Invasion: Through the activation of Rac1 and RhoA, mTOR supports cytoskeletal
  changes essential for metastatic progression by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) in BCSCs. Radioresistance and the Warburg Effect: mTOR’s role in
  metabolic reprogramming enhances glycolysis (Warburg effect), supporting cancer
  cell survival and resistance to radiation therapy, with implications for targeting
  BCSCs in therapy-resistant breast cancer. Autophagy Inhibition: mTOR directly inhibits
  ULK1 to suppress autophagy, a process that, if activated, would degrade cellular
  components under nutrient-deprived conditions. Regulatory factors, including AMPK,
  Akt, SOX9, and EVI1, further modulate mTOR activity, enhancing BCSC survival, self-renewal,
  and metastatic potential. This network highlights mTOR as a therapeutic target,
  especially given its role in CSC resilience and therapeutic resistance. Targeting
  mTOR, along with auxiliary pathways like VDAC1 and HDAC6, may offer novel strategies
  to overcome resistance in breast cancer therapy'
