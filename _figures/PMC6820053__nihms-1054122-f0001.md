caption: Schematic representation of formation and working of RGD-PEG-ECO/siRNA nanoparticles.
  (a) Amino lipid carrier ECO (E) is mixed with the targeting moiety RGD-PEG-Mal followed
  by electrostatic condensation with siRNA molecules. Oxidation of cysteine residues
  (C) to form disulfide bonds and hydrophobic condensation of the oleic acid tails
  (O) further stabilize the formation of RGD-PEG-ECO/siRNA nanoparticles. (b) RGD-PEG-ECO/siRNA
  nanoparticles mediate efficient siRNA delivery by the PERC mechanism. Nanoparticles
  are internalized into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and travel through
  the intracellular trafficking pathway. As the pH in the endosomes decreases, the
  pH-sensitive amphiphilicity of the nanoparticles enables them to induce endosomal
  membrane destabilization and endosomal escape into the cytosol. The nanoparticles
  then undergo reductive dissociation, releasing the siRNA cargo into the cytoplasm
  where it encounters the RNAi machinery to silence the target lncRNA.
