caption: (A) Amino acids are key regulators of autophagy. When they are in excess,
  mTORC1 is targeted to the lysosomal membrane, where it is activated by Rheb and
  inhibits autophagy through phosphorylation of Ulk1 complex subunits. (B) Binding
  of insulin to its receptor (IR) activates mTOR via the PI3KC1/Akt/TSC pathway, inhibiting
  autophagy. The expression of autophagy-related proteins is inhibited after the inhibition
  of FoxO transcription factors by Akt. Glucose 6-phosphate inhibits the activity
  of hexokinase-II, an mTOR activator, inhibiting autophagy. (C) Activation of EGFR
  by its ligand inhibits autophagy directly by the phosphorylation of Beclin1 or indirectly
  via GRB2 and GAB2, as well as via the phosphorylation of STAT3, which releases eIF2α
  to induce the expression of autophagy-related proteins. (D) TLR4 is activated upon
  binding of LPS, leading to the recruitment of adaptor proteins to the plasma membrane.
  As a consequence, TRAF6 is recruited, resulting in the Lys63-linked ubiquitination
  of Beclin1, allowing it to bind PI3KC3 and induce autophagy. Nrf2 is activated,
  up-regulating the expression of p62.See Glossary for definitions and the text for
  details.
