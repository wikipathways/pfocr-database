caption: 'mRNA-seq results of KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and western blot results.
  (a) mRNA sequencing results of cells exposed to PM2.5, (a1) heat map and (a2) volcano
  map (n = 3). (b) KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Upregulated genes are mainly
  tumor, MAPK, and NF-κB pathway-related genes (n = 3). (c) Signaling pathway related
  genes change: (c1) MAPK pathway and (c2) NF-κB pathway (n = 3). (d) Western blot
  detected the expression of MAPK pathway and NF-κB pathway proteins, and the experimental
  groups were control group, PM2.5 group, PAO1 group, and PAO1 + PM2.5 group. Among
  them, iκB and P65 were NF-κB pathway proteins, P44, P38, and JNK were MAPK pathway
  proteins, and β-actin and lamin-B were internal reference proteins (n = 3)'
