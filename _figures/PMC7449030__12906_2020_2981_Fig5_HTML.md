caption: Schematic of metabolic pathway being mapped by significantly differential
  metabolites. The black line indicates direct reactions between each other, and the
  dotted line represents more than one reaction between them. The red circle means
  significantly increased level (p < 0.05), while the green circle means the obviously
  decreased level (p < 0.05)
