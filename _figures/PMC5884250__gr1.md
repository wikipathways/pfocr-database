caption: Proposed molecular mechanism for maintenance of stemness by the novel ligand–receptor
  combination SCRG1/BST1. SCRG1 is hypothesized to be secreted into the extracellular
  space by MSCs and to have autocrine/paracrine activity. The putative receptor for
  SCRG1 is a complex of BST1 and integrin β1 on the MSC cell surface. The SCRG1/BST1
  axis promotes MSC migration and suppresses osteogenic differentiation through the
  FAK/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. SCRG1/BST1 maintains the stemness of MSCs and CD271
  expression.
