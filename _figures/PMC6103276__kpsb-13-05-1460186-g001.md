caption: A working model for the integrated regulation of ethylene production and
  germination of S. humilis seeds under the acidic conditions of tropical soils. The
  illustration shows the progression of S. humilis seed from sowing to final seed
  germination. The seed begins to produce ethylene following sowing at the rate dependent
  of soil pH. Hence, soil with pH < 5.0 acts as a strong signal that regulates ethylene
  biosynthesis by an increase in 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase
  activity, which leads to elevated concentration of cellular ACC. Low soil pH-induce
  ethylene production also appears to depend on the ACC oxidase activity (ACO). Once
  the radicle has emerged, elongation growth occurs at a rate determined by ethylene
  and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentrations. Interestingly the ethylene-induced
  production of auxin appears to be associated with tryptophan (Trp) concentration
  and the subsequent synthesis of IAA via tryptophan aminotransferase (TA), TA-related
  (TARs) and flavin-containing monooxygenase family proteins (YUCCA). Thus downward
  growth in response to low soil pH (< 5.0) facilities the radicle tip penetrating
  into the soil. Additionally, the ethylene signaling pathway most likely regulates
  upward hypocotyl growth. A high pH (> 5.0) condition should not produce the same
  effect. SAM, S-adenosyl methionine. 3-IPA, indole-3-pyruvic acid.
