caption: Schematic diagram of the structural pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model
  for somapacitan. The pharmacokinetic model included a dual pathway from absorption
  compartment [abs] to central compartment [central] through first-order absorption
  and zero-order absorption through a transit compartment [transit]. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
  model included an indirect response relationship (dashed line) between the central
  compartment and the insulin-like growth factor-I compartment [IGF-I]. C somapacitan
  concentration in the central compartment, EC50 somapacitan concentration corresponding
  to half-maximum stimulation of IGF-I production rate, Emax maximum increase in IGF-I
  production rate, F bioavailability, IGF-I insulin-like growth factor-I, K0 zero-order
  rate constant, Ka linear absorption rate constant, Kin production rate of IGF-I,
  Km Michaelis-Menten constant for saturable elimination, Kout first-order turnover
  of IGF-I, Ktr linear transit rate constant, V volume of distribution, Vmax maximum
  elimination rate
