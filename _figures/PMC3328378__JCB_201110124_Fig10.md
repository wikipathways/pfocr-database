caption: Model used in this study. TRF1 loss yields dysfunctional/uncapped telomeres
  that are marked with γ-H2AX foci. Dysfunctional telomeres elicit a DNA damage response
  (DDR) by activation of upstream kinases, DNA protein kinase, ATM, and ataxia telangiectasia
  and Rad3 related (ATR) that leads to a p53–p21-mediated cell cycle arrest until
  the damage is repaired. Activation of either the classical or alternative nonhomologous
  end-joining (C-NHEJ or A-NHEJ, respectively) repair pathways results in end to end
  fusions. The joining of dysfunctional telomeres results in the abolishment of the
  DNA damage signal by reducing the number of exposed chromosome ends and, thereby,
  can be considered as a temporal healing of the damage at least until the following
  mitosis, in which fused chromosomes will lead to further DSBs. In 53BP1-deficient
  cells with an impaired C-NHEJ pathway, the DNA damage signal associated with dysfunctional
  telomeres persists. Absence of 53BP1 at dysfunctional telomeres facilitates resection
  of telomeric DNA that gets coated by RPA enhancing ATR–CHK1 activation that further
  amplifies the DDR signaling, leading to an accelerated G2 arrest and eventual cell
  death. Moreover, resected telomeres act as substrates for the HR machinery, resulting
  in a higher incidence of inter- and intrachromosomal telomeric recombination events
  that impact telomere length changes. As a consequence, mice doubly deficient for
  TRF1 and 53BP1 in skin accumulate telomeric DNA damage more rapidly than TRF1 single
  knockout, severely blocking skin morphogenesis early during embryonic development.
