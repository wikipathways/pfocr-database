caption: 'Pathophysiology of Protein C in Sepsis: during sepsis, bacteria release
  endotoxins (LPS, LPI, LBP), these endotoxins bind to different receptors on neutrophils
  and monocytes and stimulate inflammatory cytokine release. These cytokines promote
  thrombin generation by upregulation of tissue factor (TF) expression on monocytes
  and endothelium. Inflammatory cytokines also inhibit protein C synthesis in the
  liver and reduce thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) expression,
  and thereby inhibit APC formation. Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC)
  enhances neutrophils and monocytes apoptosis and therefore inhibits cytokines release
  and reducing tissue damage.'
