caption: Isoprene emission rate decreases with increasing ambient CO2 concentration
  (Ca), but photosynthesis increases with increasing Ca. Illustration of the hypothesis
  of how high ambient CO2 might inhibit plant isoprene emission. The immediate isoprene
  precursor dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMADP) is synthesized in chloroplasts via the
  MEP/DOXP pathway that starts with the condensation of pyruvate and GAP. GAP for
  DMADP synthesis comes directly from photosynthesis, but it is currently still unclear
  what is the chloroplastic source of pyruvate. It has been suggested that pyruvate
  can be synthesized directly in chloroplasts (; ), while others have postulated the
  necessary import of the pyruvate precursor PEP via a specific carrier into the chloroplasts
  (; ; ). It has further been suggested that the rate of PEP transport into chloroplasts
  is limited by cytosolic PEP concentration that is under the control of PEPC (; ;
  ). Under low Ca (A), a smaller fraction of cytosolic PEP is converted to oxalacetate
  (OAA), while the fraction increases under higher Ca (B), supposedly leading to a
  lower rate of PEP transport into the chloroplasts, curbing the rate of isoprene
  synthesis. If so, feeding the leaves with malate that is in equilibrium with OAA,
  but that also serves as an inhibitor of PEPC, or feeding with the specific PEPC
  inhibitor diethyl oxalacetate (DOA) should result in a greater PEP pool and, thus,
  abolish the effect of high CO2 concentration on isoprene emission.
