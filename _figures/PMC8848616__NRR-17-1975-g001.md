caption: 'Proposed mechanisms for alterations in glucose metabolism and homeostasis
  in ALS.Upregulated processes in the pathway are indicated in blue and downregulated
  processes are indicated in red. (A) Glucose utilization is reduced in ALS by the
  changes in activities of glucose transporter and glycolytic enzymes, which ultimately
  results in reduced intermediate metabolites entering TCA cycle and ETC for ATP production.
  Changes in enzymatic activity involved in the degradative pathway of glycogen (glycogenolysis)
  and increased production of glycogen (glycogenesis) contribute to the overaccumulation
  of glycogen in ALS. Deficits in glucose utilization also drive the cell to preferentially
  use FAO by increasing activities of fatty acid transporter and lipogenic enzymes.

  (B) Systemic impairments of glucose homeostasis in ALS are caused by changes in
  the actions of both insulin and glucagon. Reduction in insulin levels and sensitivity
  induced by the loss of beta cell mass could potentially promote glucose clearance
  through an insulin-independent mechanism of action. In addition to glucagon resistance
  and impairment in the glucagon signaling pathway, decreased levels of insulin could
  also downregulate paracrine inhibitory effects on glucagon secretion from the alpha
  cell, leading to increased circulating glucagon levels. Created with BioRender.com.
