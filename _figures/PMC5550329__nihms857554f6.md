caption: MLK3 mediates CXCL10 induction during hepatocyte lipotoxicity by triggering
  a MAPK signaling pathway that induces the activating phosphorylation of MKK3/6,
  p38 resulting in STAT1 phosphorylation at Ser727, and its nuclear localization.
  Phospho-Ser727 STAT1 binds to and activates the CXCL10 gene promoter. These events
  lead to transcriptional upregulation of CXCL10. We employed both genetic and pharmacological
  inhibition as indicated in the figure to demonstrate the sequence of events in the
  signaling cascade, and to test our hypothesis in a loss of function paradigm.
