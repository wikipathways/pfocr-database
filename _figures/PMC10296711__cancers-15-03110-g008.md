caption: A schematic illustration of the TLR/IL1/IRAK/NF-κB inflammatory signaling
  pathway axis. The diagram also displays the potential novel therapeutic targets
  against inflammation-driven PCa progression. In our lab, we are interested in understanding
  the role of IRAKs in prostate tumorigenesis as well as evaluating the potential
  of targeting their signaling pathways. IL1Rs and TLRs are activated by their ligands
  and/or PAMPs/DAMPs, thus inducing a series of downstream inflammatory signaling
  cascades regulated by IRAKs at the midstream level. It is worth elucidating the
  cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in chronic inflammation-driven cancer
  growth, metastasis, chemoresistance, metabolic reprogramming, stemness, immune evasion,
  and neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. Created with BioRender.com
