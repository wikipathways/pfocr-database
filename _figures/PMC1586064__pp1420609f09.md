caption: Scheme of the activation of the PvACCase gene in response to biotic and abiotic
  stress. Pathogen- or ROS-induced PvACCase gene promoter activation can utilize either
  the JA (COI1)- or the ethylene (ETR1)-responsive signaling pathways. In the model,
  we position ROS downstream of the pathogen in agreement with the knowledge that
  ROS are generated during the hypersensitive response caused by an incompatible plant-pathogen
  interaction (). Flavonoids produced in response to pathogens act as ROS scavengers,
  limiting the damage caused by this stress condition. IAA-induced PvACCase gene promoter
  activation is mediated through the capacity of auxins to promote ethylene synthesis.
  Wounding induces PvACCase gene activation by a signaling pathway independent of
  both JA and ethylene.
