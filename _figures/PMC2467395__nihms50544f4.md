caption: 'Mechanism of berberine in regulation of metabolism: 1) Berberine enhances
  glucose uptake through induction of glycolysis, which is due to inhibition of aerobic
  respiratory; 2) AMPK activation stimulated by berberine is a consequence of inhibition
  of mitochondrial function; 3) Berberine suppresses adipogenesis through inhibition
  of PPARγ and C/EBPα function; 4) Berberine is able to decrease intestinal glucose
  absorption by inhibition of α-glucosidase; 5) Berberine up-regulates LDL receptor
  (LDLR) expression through increasing LDLR mRNA, which is related to inactivation
  of ERK and activation of JNK pathway.'
