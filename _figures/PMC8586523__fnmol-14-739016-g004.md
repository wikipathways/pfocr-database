caption: 'Association network of pathways in human ALS from frontal cortex, spinal
  cord, and serum. Significantly enriched KEGG pathways were combined and visualized
  in a network. KEGG pathways are represented by nodes, and shared gene content between
  pathways are represented by edges. Node shape indicates the tissue source of the
  enriched pathways: octagon (frontal cortex, spinal cord, serum), hexagon (frontal
  cortex, spinal cord), square (frontal cortex, serum), circle (frontal cortex), diamond
  (spinal cord), and triangle (serum). The size of each node denotes the number of
  miRNAs in that pathway, while the color gradient represents –log10(P-value) (see
  color scale, yellow to red). All networks were organized by the Edge-weighted Spring
  Embedded layout in Cytoscape with minimal manual node rearrangement for visibility.
  Background colors delimit highly inter-connected subnetworks identified by the Cytoscape
  MCODE app (): green (brain function), gray (neurotransmitter systems), purple (intracellular
  signaling cascades), blue (cancer related), and pink (stem cell renewal). Non-clustered
  pathways are arranged at the bottom. FC, frontal cortex; SC, spinal cord.'
