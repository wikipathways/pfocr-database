caption: 'Schematic of glutamine metabolism. Various aspects of Gln metabolism are
  shown. Gln is taken up via SLC1A5 and enters into the glutaminolysis pathway, then
  is converted to glutamate via GLS. GLUD then converts glutamate to αKG, which is
  shuttled to the Krebs cycle. In addition, glutamate can be converted to other amino
  acids, including alanine and aspartate, by the action of GOT and GPT, respectively.
  Glutamate produced from the glutaminolysis pathway via enzymatic reaction can be
  used as a source for GSH synthesis. Gln is transported out of cells via SLC7A5,
  and leucine enters the cell; by doing so, mTORC1 is activated. mTORC1 can stimulate
  Gln metabolism, therefore promotes cancer proliferation and survival. c-Myc elevates
  expression of GlS and GS, then Gln metabolism in cancerous cells is increased. Abbreviations:
  α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; OAA, oxaloacetate; GSH, Glutathione;
  GLUD, glutamate dehydrogenase; GOT, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase; GPT, glutamate
  pyruvate transaminase.'
