caption: Competence regulatory networks in S. mutans. Regulatory links are organized
  into two pheromone response networks acting in peptide-rich media such as THB (A)
  or in peptide-free CDM (B). (A) In rich media, extracellular CSP induces the expression
  of bacteriocin and immunity proteins (red) through the ComED TCSTS pathway. Other
  genes are possibly induced by direct or indirect activation by phosphorylated ComE.
  The bacteriocins are thought to create pores that allow internalization of the competence
  pheromone XIP. XIP binds to ComR to activate the expression of at least two genes
  (green), comS (encoding XIP) and sigX (encoding the alternative sigma factor σx).
  Induction of comS creates a positive feedback loop that increases the production
  of XIP and σx, while σx activates the expression of genes (blue) involved in DNA
  integration (e.g., comGA, comEC, and dprA). (B) In peptide-free CDM, extracellular
  XIP is internalized via the Opp permease and binds to ComR, activating the expression
  of at least two genes, comS (encoding XIP) and sigX. Induction of comS creates a
  positive feedback loop, while elevated σx activates the expression of genes involved
  in DNA integration (e.g., comGA, comEC, and dprA). Bacteriocin and immunity proteins
  are upregulated as a result of comED induction by σx. Uncertainties about the regulon
  assignment for the full range of genes that change expression in response to the
  pheromones are represented by question marks, and genes upregulated but not exemplified
  are represented by ellipses.
