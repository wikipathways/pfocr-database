caption: 'Schematic overview of the proposed mechanism: pressure overload induces
  the up‐regulation of miR‐195a‐5p in cardiomyocytes, which promotes cardiac hypertrophy
  via suppression of the cardiac metabolic pathway and up‐regulation of β‐MHC, BNP
  and ANP, and may finally lead to heart failure; In contrast to pressure overload,
  exercise training against pressure overload–induced cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy
  via up‐regulation of HSF1 and promoting HIF‐1α/VEGF pathway (As displayed: Exercise
  has been pro can promote myocardial angiogenesis and prevent the transition from
  cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure via miR‐126/SPRED‐1 signalling pathway and
  miR‐126/PI3KR2 signalling pathway); HSF1 deficiency inhibits the expression of HIF‐1α
  and downstream VEGF, thereby lead to cardiac angiogenesis defect and impairs the
  cardiac adaptive response of TAC mice to exercise training'
