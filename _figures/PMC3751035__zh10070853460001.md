caption: Flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP; A), regulation of
  O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) cycling enzymes O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)/O-GLcNAcase
  (OGA) in mediating insulin resistance (B), and Ca2+ cycling (C). Increased protein
  GlcNAcylation by 1) excess HBP flux due to elevated glucose, overexpression of glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase (GFAT), or glucosamine and 2) overexpression of OGT or inhibition
  of OGA {by O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)-amino-N-phenylcarbamate
  (PUGNAc) or 1,2-dideoxy-2′-methyl-d-glucopyranoso[2,1-d]-2′-thiazoline (GT)} contributes
  to the establishment of insulin resistance. Overexpression of OGT in cardiomyocytes
  impairs Ca2+ cycling, whereas OGA overexpression promotes proper Ca2+ cycling. Glucosamine-6-P,
  glucosamine 6-phosphate; Fru-6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; Gln, glucosamine; DON, doxynorleucine;
  UDP-GlcNAc, uridine 5′-diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine. Red arrows represent increases
  in respective metabolites. Blue arrows represent unknown mechanisms.
