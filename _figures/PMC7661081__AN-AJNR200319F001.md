caption: Sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Sphingolipid biosynthesis leads to the formation
  of ceramide, the main building block of complex sphingolipids. Ceramide is degraded
  to sphingosine. Sphingosine is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases, leading to
  formation of S1P, which has intracellular activities and also serves as a ligand
  for S1P receptors (S1PR1–5). S1P can be dephosphorylated by specific and nonspecific
  lipid phosphatases, regenerating sphingosine. Alternatively, S1P can be irreversibly
  degraded by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (S1P lyase), which controls the sole exit
  point of sphingolipid metabolism. S1P catabolism by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase
  results in formation of hexadecenal and ethanolamine phosphate. CoA indicates coenzyme
  A.
