caption: The metabolic contributions of elevated biopterins in the pathogenesis of
  ME/CFS. Reduced mitochondria consumption of oxygen followed by the impairment of
  the electron transport chain increases electron pressure in mitochondria, affects
  the redox balance in cells, causing the augmentation of the non-oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway, and may lead to the dysregulation of biopterin homeostasis. The
  potential redox imbalance increases reactive stress in the endoplasmic reticulum
  and disrupts the glutathione homeostasis, causing protein misfolding. Reactive stress
  also activates mTORC1, leading to autophagy impairment. Cellular increase in reductive
  potential causes the inactivation of NRF2 and downregulation of anti-oxidant genes
  in mitochondria. All these phenomena may lead to the augmentation of stress and
  inflammation
