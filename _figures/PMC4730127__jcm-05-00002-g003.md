caption: Targeting of the genes and pathways for stem cell maintenance by miR-200
  family miRNAs. Expression of the miR-200 family miRNAs is downregulated in the breast
  CSCs and normal mammary stem/progenitor cells, and is upregulated in the more differentiated
  counterparts. The miR-200 family miRNAs are involved in the regulation stem cell
  functions by targeting the genes and pathways important for stem cell maintenance,
  such as self-renewal factor Bmi-1, the apoptosis signaling pathway, the canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway, EMT and the Notch signaling pathway.
