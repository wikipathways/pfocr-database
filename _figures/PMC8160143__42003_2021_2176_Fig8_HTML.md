caption: Bacterial-derived products, such as LPS and Pam3, can induce SAA1 (humans)
  or SAA3 (mouse), which can trigger dendritic cells or macrophages to produce IL1α
  and in turn, IL1α can induce the expression of IL6 in fibroblasts. In addition,
  SAA1 can also induce the expression of IL6 in fibroblasts in the absence of macrophages
  of dendritic cells. The secreted IL6 can then induce the expression of IL22 in T
  cells and this expression can be enhanced by IL7, which can be secreted by IEC.
  Moreover, the secretion of IL7 by IEC, can be enhanced by IL22, resulting in a positive
  feedback loop for IL22 induction and eventually giving higher expression of Reg3β
  and Reg3γ. Alternatively, LPS can directly activate sampling DCs and macrophages
  or activate these cells after intestinal damage, resulting in a strong immune response
  with high induction of IL6, IL1α, IL1β, TNFα, and subsequent IL22 induction, in
  which case TNFα enhances the IL6-induced IL22 production by T cells. A viral pathway
  involving IFNβ1 can also induce IL22 via IL7 produced by IEC and fibroblast- secreted
  IL6, after which anti-viral proteins (AVPs) can be induced by IL22.
