caption: The DNA sensors and their signaling pathways. The mammalian cell has evolved
  a number of sensors able to recognize anomalous DNA present in the cytosol and to
  trigger innate immune responses, including TLR9, AIM2, and cGAS. TLR9 localizes
  in the endosomal compartment and is involved in the recognition of hypomethylated
  CpG-rich DNA. Upon recognition of DNA, TLR9 recruits the common TLR adaptor MyD88
  and activates IRF7 and NF-κB, leading to type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine
  production. AIM2 and cGAS are located in the cytoplasm. AIM2 is composed of a C-terminal
  HIN-200 domain and an N-terminal pyrin domain. Cytosolic dsDNA binds to the HIN-200
  domain of AIM2, leading to the activation of AIM2. The pyrin domain of activated
  AIM2 recruits and interacts with the pyrin domain of ASC, and the CARD of ASC binds
  to the CARD of pro-caspase-1, forming the AIM2 inflammasome. Active caspase-1 cleaves
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, resulting in the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Meanwhile,
  active caspase-1 induces pyroptosis via the proteolytic cleavages of the N-terminal
  fragment of gasdermin D. Cytosolic DNA binds to and activates cGAS, inducing the
  production of cGAMP. Then cGAMP binds to its ER adaptor STING, leading to the activation
  of TBK1, IRF3, and NF-κB, inducing the transcription of genes encoding type I IFNs
  and proinflammatory cytokines. AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP;
  cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  IFN, interferon; STING, stimulator of interferon genes
