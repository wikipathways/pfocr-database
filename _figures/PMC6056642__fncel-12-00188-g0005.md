caption: Interaction between omav and Nrf2 pathway. The Nrf2 transcription factor
  in cells is regulated by ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation through Keap1
  protein. The increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell promotes its translocation
  to the nucleus where it binds the antioxidant responsive elements (ARE) favoring
  the transcription of the genes involved in the antioxidant response. Omav is a Nrf2
  inducer promotes its activity by inhibiting Keap1 ubiquitinating activity and preventing
  Nrf2 degradation.
