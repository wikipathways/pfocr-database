caption: Schematic Models of the Signaling Pathway of Vertebrate Rod Photoreceptor
  and Blastocladiella Zoospore Phototaxis(A) In the vertebrate visual signaling pathway,
  photoexcitation of the G protein-coupled rhodopsin receptor leads to activation
  of rod and cone heterotrimeric G protein transducin complex stimulating hydrolysis
  of cGMP []. The decrease in cGMP concentration leads to closure of cGMP-gated (CNG)
  channels, blockage of Na+ influx, and hyperpolarization of photoreceptor plasma
  membrane, leading to transmission of signal through synapses []. Reduction of CNG
  channel activity blocks Ca2+ influx, decreasing cytoplasmic calcium concentration
  in retinal photoreceptor outer segments (ROS) and leading to activation of guanylyl
  cyclases (ROS-GCs) by the now Ca2+-free GC-activating proteins (GCAPs) through acceleration
  of ROS-GC dimerization, thus restoring cGMP levels [].(B) In the B. emersonii zoospore
  phototaxis transduction pathway, photoisomerization of rhodopsin in BeGC1 activates
  guanylyl cyclase activity, leading to the synthesis of cGMP from GTP. Cyclic GMP
  opens K+-selective BeCNG1 channels, thereby causing hyperpolarization of the plasma
  membrane. A putative opening of voltage-activated calcium channels could produce
  elevation of [Ca2+], which would interact with the flagellum altering the flagellar
  beat, as in Arbacia sperm [].RhI, type I rhodopsin; RhII, type II rhodopsin; GC,
