  Alcohol undergoes first pass gastric metabolism by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase
  (ADH). However, most alcohol oxidation occurs in the liver. Alcohol is metabolized
  to acetaldehyde primarily by alcohol dehydrogenase (ALD) and the cytochrome P450
  2E1 (CYP2E1). This later pathway is particularly relevant following chronic alcohol
  abuse. Acetaldehyde is converted to acetate in the mitochondria by the enzyme acetaldehyde
  dehydrogenase (ALDH) type 2. Most of the acetate produced enters the systemic circulation
  and is activated to acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), a key intermediate metabolite in peripheral
  tissues. Acetaldehyde can form adducts that can produce injury through activation
  of immune responses. During the oxidative process, both ADH and ALDH reactions reduce
  NAD+ to NADH, shifting the cellular redox ratio, thereby affecting several NAD+
  requiring enzymes like lactate and pyruvate dehydrogenase and affecting pathways
  including glycolysis, citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and gluconeogenesis.
  In addition, the cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, contribute to the
  oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde, particularly at increasing alcohol concentrations
  as well as following their induction by chronic alcohol abuse. Because CYP2E1 is
  involved in oxidation of several drugs to their reactive intermediates (e.g., nitrosamines,
  acetaminophen, and halothane), their toxicity is enhanced in alcoholics. This pathway
  of alcohol oxidation results in the production of large amounts of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) and is thought to be an important mechanism contributing to alcoholic
  liver injury. ROS are eliminated by antioxidants like glutathione (GSH) under normal
  conditions. Alcohol depletes cellular GSH stores, thereby further exacerbating ROS-mediated
  injury. ROS can interact with lipids, producing lipid peroxidation, leading to formation
  of reactive molecules such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE),
  which can in turn form protein adducts. A minor fraction of alcohol metabolism occurs
  in peroxisomes through catalase-dependent oxidation. Alcohol can also react with
  glucuronic acid to form ethyl-glucuronide, a soluble, non-volatile conjugate that
  is readily excreted and detected in body fluids, tissue, sweat, and hair for an
  extended time following alcohol consumption.
