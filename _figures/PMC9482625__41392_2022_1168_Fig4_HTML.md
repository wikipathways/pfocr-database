caption: Under the pressure of TKI treatment, tumor cells undergo metabolic reprogramming
  to adapt to the altered environment caused by TKI, but the metabolic reprogramming
  of tumor cells is not the same in different contexts. Some drug-resistant cells
  mostly exhibit elevated activity of enzymes related to the glycolytic pathway to
  enhance glycolysis, and the Warburg effect also tends to be enhanced, leading to
  increased lactate production, which can stimulate CAFs to secrete HGF and activate
  MET on cancer cells. In addition, serine metabolism, the pentosephosphate pathway,
  and glutamine metabolism in tumor cells are also reprogrammed. The intermediates
  of these pathways can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle to assist lipid and protein
  synthesis and promote cell survival, and some antioxidant substances, such as GSH
  and NADPH, produced midway can also reduce ROS levels to avoid cell death. The reprogramming
  of lipid metabolism can promote cell survival and resist cell death by affecting
  multiple processes, such as lipid composition of cell membranes, intracellular signaling,
  and sensitivity to oxidative stress, leading to TKI resistance
