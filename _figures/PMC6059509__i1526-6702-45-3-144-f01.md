caption: The first reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway is the enzymatic dehydrogenation
  of glucose 6-phosphate by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD).ADP = adenosine
  diphosphate; ATP = adenosine triphosphate; eNOS = enzyme nitric oxide synthase;
  GSH = glutathione; GSSG = glutathione disulfide; NADP = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; NADP+ = reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NO = nitric
  oxide
