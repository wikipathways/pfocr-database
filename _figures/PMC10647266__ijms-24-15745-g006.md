caption: Inactivation of TORC1 promotes Sic1 stabilization to arrest the cell cycle.
  TORC1 coordinates cell cycle progression and nutrient availability in G1 through
  Sic1 phosphorylation on T173. This phosphorylation leads to the accumulation of
  Sic1 as it prevents its degradation, resulting in G1 arrest. Inactivation of TORC1
  after the addition of rapamycin promotes a decrease in cyclin levels. Initially,
  a reduction in Cln1, Cln 2 and Cln 3, and consequently Clb5, reduces Sic1 phosphorylation
  and degradation. Clb5-Cdk1 complexes. Stress or pheromone-activated kinases, namely
  Slt2, Hog1 and Fus3, induce phosphorylation on T173, leading to a cell cycle arrest.
  Conversely, TORC1 drives a conserved signaling pathway that controls the activity
  of Cdc55 protein phosphatase 2A (PP2ACdc55) to dephosphorylate pT173 within Sic1,
  promoting G1 progression. This signaling cascade includes kinase Rim15, which phosphorylates
  endosulfines (Igo1/2) to inhibit the PP2ACdc55 directly. Both Rim15 and endosulfines
  are activated after nutrient limitation. Rim15 function is negatively regulated
  by TORC1, PKA, Pho80/Pho85 and Cln1,2,3-Cdk1. Additionally, PP2ACdc55 dephosphorylates
  the transcriptional activator Gis1, preventing a gene expression program to drive
  cells into quiescence. The kinase Yak1 positively regulates Gis1 by inducing its
  phosphorylating and subsequently translocation to promoters. Furthermore, PKA counteracts
  the quiescence program by phosphorylating and inhibiting Yak1. The balance between
  Yak1 and PP2ACdc55 regulates Gis1 to promote a reversible cellular quiescence program.
